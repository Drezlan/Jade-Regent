# Introductions

The party meet for the first time in the [[Rusty Dragon]] in [[Sandpoint]]. Either local themselves or with ties to locals they are drawn by the call for goblin heads and the promise of bounty for each one presented to the sheriff [[Belor Hemlock]]. There have been increasing reports of goblin attacks on the locals when travelling past or through [[Brinestump marsh]]. As they learn this news from [[Ameiko Kaijitsu]] she asks them to keep an eye out for her missing shipment of fireworks, having ordered them for the upcoming festival and not recieved them yet, She offers an extra payment for any returned to her. The group asks her if there is any person of expertise on the marsh they may contact to help them locate the goblins. She recommends they speak to a halfling [[Walthus Proudstump]] who lives on the coastal portion of the marsh and to make sure and try his fish stew. Upon entering the swamp the take the northern most road heading west to speak to this halfling. They quickly encounter three goblins playing with fireworks. [[Ochitsuite Arashi]] calls out to them to lay down their arms. The Goblins take advantage of the warning and attack one of them blinding Ochi with fireworks. The goblins are dispatched quickly. The bounty hunters continue to the halfing's home [[Walthus' Home]]. On the way they are shadowed by a [[Pale Figure]] who always seems to be travelling away from them back into the swamp. They continue on and encounter [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons]] bearing the weapons of decidedly foreign origin bearing marks of the dragon empires including wakizashis. They dispatch them. Believing them to be holdouts from prior undead related events from years past they take some of these items and continue on. Arriving at [[Walthus' Home]] they find his behavior on meeting them very strange. After being invited in they are wary but inquire of his famous stew and to sit and ask him some questions about [[Brinestump marsh]] and the [[Licktoad Goblins]] activities. Seeming to not know his own home and finally slurping down a rat in front of them the party decides something is definitely amiss. The [[Walthus Impersonator]] is slain and [[Walthus Proudstump]] is rescued from his refuge in a panic room in the back of his home. Though injured, shaken, and hungry, he will live. As thanks [[Walthus Proudstump]] gifts the heros some potions, treats their wounds, and sits with them to answer their questions. The information given includes the origin of his imposter the strange nature of it's being so far north in the marsh, The location of a witches hut further south and west along the coast. With darkness falling the companions return to the rusty dragon to regroup and collect the bounty for the fireworks and few goblin heads they've aquired.

Returning to [[Brinestump marsh]] with more accurate information they decide they want to investigate this [[Pale Figure]]. Retracting their steps to the point on the path to [[Walthus' Home]] where they saw the creature they set out in the direction it travelled. Finding it to be the [[Characters/4 Brinestump NPCs/Soggy Swamp Monster/Soggy Swamp Monster]] and the source of many a missing person from [[Sandpoint]]. They dispatch the creature with [[Ochitsuite Arashi]] nearly being felled. They investigate the bodies and bring the information back to town so that the victims families may know peace. They share what they have learned with the sheriff [[Belor Hemlock]] first who rewards them for the good deed.

### Rest

They return to [[Brinestump marsh]] again and head towards the [[Goblin Camp]] to the best of their knowledge. Upon arrival at [[Licktoad Village]] the adventerers find much of it in ruins and possibly exploded. After some investigation they discover the goblins holed up in one of the still standing buildings with the entry boarded up. The group pries the way open and is immediately assualted by seemingly terrified goblins including the [[Goblin Chief]] on his salamander steed. The Chief won't be reasoned with. They dispatch most of them fairly easily and take one alive with several escaping after the heros understanding that they wish to flee. Ochi insists that they will be of little danger with no chief and their number reduced but [[Grayson]] is very upset by with this sharing his mentor [[Shelalu Andosana]]'s attitude towards [[Sparing the Goblins]]. The captive is very forthcoming about the events leading to their fortification inside the building  informing the party that [[Clak-claks]] came from the south in numbers to collect a chest the goblins had looted from either a [[Shipwreck]] in the area or a [[Cave]]. They seemed disinterested in the goblins once they had it in their possession and returned south towards the cave. The party takes this information, what remains of the goods the goblins recovered (including the separate stolen fireworks), and more goblin ears back to Sandpoint to regroup and rest.

### Rest

Following up on the goblin's information about the [[Clak-claks]] incursion into [[Licktoad Village]] the party travels back to the village and follows the clear path the [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons]] cut back to the [[Cave]] through the swampy undergrowth. On arrival at the cave [[Ochi]] cuts down the vines covering the entrance. They enter and find it fairly normal until they reach pooling water as deep as their shoulders in some places. This is compounded by lack of vision in the darkness. Wading through the water they find the bottom of the body to be slick and difficult to cross. When making their way to the second disconnected exposed landing the [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons]] emerge and attack them. The heros stay close together to call out approaching enemies in the dark. They finish dispatching these skeletons and find another more [[Regal Skeleton]] in the furthest chamber in the back. This skeleton watches them but makes no move until they get close. It lowers it's sword to point it at them as a challenge. [[Ochi]] and [[Grayson]] understand the gesture and [[Grayson]] does not interfere. [[Ochi]] is outmatched and surrenders. The skeleton accepts his surrender and lowers his weapon and turns to dust in front of them leaving [[Tsutamu's Chest]] to the party as well as his weapon the [[Whispering Shrike]]. Inside the chest they find [[Rokuro's letter]] from [[Rokuro Kaijitsu]] to his son [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu]] that mentioned some secret that would be revealed at a later date but never was. The rest of it informs the party that they may find more at the old Kaijitsu settlement of [[Brinewall VIllage]]. They also find inside the chest a richly made fan with a map drawn on one side that marks the shipwrecks in the area [[Kaijitsu Fan map]]. They gather the chest to return to town. On the way out they attempt to take a different route stumbling in to a lair of giant spiders who don't spot them. [[Ochi]] insists that they are hurting no one as they have heard no reports of spiders attacking anyone. [[Grayson]] wants to clear them out for the safety of Sandpoint and the inhabitants of the marsh Ultimately [[Ochi]] wins out arguing they are too wounded to face them and they end up [[Sparing the Spiders]]. They return the way they came and depart towards the [[Brinestump Marsh Witch]]es hut on recommendation from the sheriff that they perform a wellness check. They arrive and knock and call out for her but she does not appear. They enter anyways apologizing and discover that she seems to have been a casualty of her own experiments. While searching the house [[Ochi]] discovers her [[Ratling Familiar]] who screeches at him to leave. Not wanting to be rude he asks the creatures relation to the witch and understands that she was it's mistress. Backing out and apologizing he informs the others and they exit. As they all reach the front and wonder at what will become of the place the Ratling cracks the door and throws out a bag of goods and tells them to leave. The party does.

Having returned to [[Sandpoint]] and relaying their discovery to [[Ameiko]], the remaining [[Kaijitsus]], they prepare to depart for [[Brinewall VIllage]] with [[Sandru's Caravan]] including [[Koya]] and [[Shelalu]]. They see it as an adventure. With many having no other reason to stay they all join up. Waiting on certain preparations they spend some time at the [[Rusty Dragon]] mingling and asking and answering questions. [[The Caravan]] sets out. As they near [[Brinewall]] [[Ameiko]] starts appear weak and not herself. They come to a point where the caravan can no longer continue up the path. The party travels the rest of the way on foot. They come on the remains of the place and survey the area. They first check the [[Brinewall Lighthouse]] and find a skeleton key as well as some valuables in a waterproof chest. They bring the chest back to [[Sandru]] and [[The Caravan]]. It's at this point that they realize Ameiko is extremely unwell. Koya determines that she is being possessed by a Kami which is most unusual. While Ameiko is weak it doesn't appear to be doing any harm to her. Through her it keeps repeating a cryptic message. [[Ameiko's Possesion]]

“One treasure beyond two seals in the third vault...”“Beware the birds who wish to fly but cannot...”“A key you seek lies in the grip of the ten-handed one—his fear is your greatest ally...” “Beware the cuckolded cuckoo—it is in his shattered silent love you should seek aid...” “Grandfather waits in the dark, but he knows not who he was...”

 Lacking the ability to help her they return to [[Brinewall VIllage]] believing the possessor is telling them something in [[Brinewall Keep]] is related. They check the [[graveyard]] when they get back and find no familiar names but encounter a fey creature called [[Spivey]] who has been keeping watch against the evil infesting the keep and maintaining the altar to [[Desna]] and the graves. Our Traveller's ask them about the evil. Spivey tells them they saw and felt much, Corbies, Ogres and other worse things. After hearing [[Spivey]]'s information the caravaneers promise to clear the keep so they can be free to travel again. The fey thanks them and blesses the party. They begin investigating the rest of [[Brinewall VIllage]] and come on the corpse of a wyrm ( [[Sea Drake]] ) rotting on the beach slain by manufactured weapons. They approach to get a better look and are beset by Reefclaws. They dispatch the creatures and continue on to [[Brinewall Keep]]. After some careful reconnaissance they spot some Corbie guards who don't notice them. Upon further probing of the perimeter they find purchase through one of the towers. Making their way in they climb the ladder hoping to find a good vantage to gather more information before engaging but are spotted immediately. They engage the Corbies who meet them first. Two retreat across the keep yard and up a wall to the main structure and man a catapult. While they begin eliminating the corbies close to them the others on the catapult open fire but miss. At the same time a grotesque pincered beast [[Flatbelly]] and a giant spider appear and engage the party as well. Beset on two fronts the party begin to panic. Luckily after the firing of their first shot the now obviously dilapidated catapult explodes into splinters and the Corbie operators reengage without it. The party prevails in the melee. Just when they think they are done battling however a giant bat [[Mobat]] like creatures swoops around from the other side of the keep and charges them. They shake off it's piercing howl and strike it as it attempts to swoop down on them. The creature in it's wounded state tries to flee but can't escape [[Grayson]]'s aim who ends it with a final pursuing shot.
The party returns to [[The Caravan]]

### Rest

[[Shoko]] Comes looking for [[Koya]] realizing she had departed [[Sandpoint]] and finds the party regrouping at [[The Caravan]]. He joins the party after playing a bit of catch up and hearing of [[Ameiko's Possesion]]. He recalls that [[Brinewall Keep]] is a [[Kaijitsus]] holding from 30 years ago. They set out for the keep again. Arriving at the keep they decide to enter through the front gate this time. Believing they cleared most of the Corbies and other evils from the outer defenses the travelers still proceed cautiously. Inside the gatehouse they find two dead Corbies that the party had no hand in killing which raises some suspicions. In the interest of surprise they peek out windows as they pass them and see some large creatures to the east where they have not been yet. Entering the courtyard again they encounter two wrestling Ogrekin which [[Grayson]] had spotted from the gatehouse. [[Shoko]] casts sleep on them and the party dispatches them while they're unconscious. [[Ochi]] abstains [[Refusing to kill the helpless]]. Shortly after they enter the nearest and most southern room of the keep. Inside they find [[Muthilduh]] who is angry we have killed her harem and strikes [[Ochi]] who is unaware yet of her presence. The party dispatches her also. [[Koya]] heals the not insignificant damage [[Ochi]] took in the engagement. Continuing on into the keep entering the main hall (west) they find several Corbies performing a play for a long-nosed red masked humanoid [[Kokinu]]. They sneak closer and [[Shoko]] tries to put them to sleep as well. He only gets one on the first attempt but gets more on the second. Ochi moves in a strikes the only conscious Corbie and then runs up to the [[Oni]] who has transformed into a winged Tengu form and retreats a little. Trogolodytes pour in from another room off of the hall to the Northeast and engage [[Shoko]] and [[Grayson]] filling the room with a powerful stench. A monitor lizard joins in from the same door also. The party sleeps or kills all the enemies, fighting on two fronts, except the [[Oni]] [[Kokinu]] who retreats by disappearing magically (Dimension Door). The party enters the ballroom off of the main hall (Southwest) and spots him on the balcony a floor up and they pursue. Looking out the arrow slits in their chase they spot some giant insectoid creature dwelling in a small body of water (chillin). The [[Oni]] flees again as more Corbies enter from a series of rooms to the northeast lead by a Corby priest of Pazuzu [[Nevakali]]. The travellers dispatch them all.
Ascending further they find themselves in the living quarters. Checking all the rooms one by one they encounter an [[Attic Whisperer]] and It steals Ochi's voice and is vanquished by the party thanks to [[Koya]] On the walls they discover drawings depicting Oni and Ninja storming the keep and mudering it's inhabitants. They believe the bookcase fell on the boy in the commotion. The other ghostly inhabitant in the halls outside the living quarter is the remnants of the souls of the [[Murdered Brinewallers]]. Koya puts them to rest temporarily and believes that they will find peace when the evil that took their lives and this castle is ousted. Finding much of the rest of the living quarters/ kitchen on the second floor empty with signs of Corbie habitation they also find a defaced shrine to [[Desna]] seeming to be altered to some winged creature the party failed to identify. Koya and the others attempt to clean it up. Afterwards they continue on and up.
At the top of the tower they come across a Harpy. She does not speak to the party verbally but instead they take measure of each other and she gestures for them to come closer. [[Ochi]] does and she touches him and communicates telepathically with him. She tells him she is [[Zaiobe]] and she has lost love for the [[Oni]] who they learn is called [[Kokinu]]. [[Kokinu]] serves something called the [[Ten-handed one]]. [[Zaiobe]] and [[Kokinu]] used to date. She volunteers to aid us in killing [[Kokinu]]. She has lived in [[Brinewall Keep]] for a long time. She tells that there is a [[Vault]] no one has been able to enter thus far. [[Ochi]] tries to communicate this all to his companions through a really terrible game of charades for what is far too long before [[Shoko]] makes him step aside to speed up the process. With Zaiobe in tow they all journey to the dungeon and clear a southern room containing [[Rotscale]] and two other Trogolodytes fighting for his amusement as well as a mostly scoured armory. After which they also discover strange spores in an antechamber off the kitchen to the west and after following that to it's source they find a slime creature (Phycomid) they dispatch from range. Even deeper still they find a proper dungeon containing [[Sluwort]] and some prison cells. Having the jump on him and the aid of some Alchemist's fire via [[Shoko]] and Zaiobe he is quickly ended. Inside one of the Cells the Murder Machine ™ finds one [[Kelda Oxgutter]]. [[Sluwort]] was threatening to eat her. She didn't trust us right away but after a little coaxing her story is revealed. She and her very late party were responsible for the mysterious end of the [[Sea Drake]] back in [[Brinewall VIllage]]. She was weak after the ordeal and was captured by the Corbies and Co and brought into [[Brinewall Keep]]. She offered aid and also mentioned that she needs to return home at some point and if we help her back to her home of [[Kalsgard]] her family will reward us. Attempting to continue deeper the caravaneers are confroned with a series of what seem impossibly well locked doors into a cave-like chamber we unlock one of the second lock after jamming the first one and get stopped by the third. Returning and trying another route they spot [[Nindinzego]] and [[Kokinu]] in the cavernous room off the dungeon and attempt to sneak up on them. There is a large drop in the path and in crossing it [[Shoko]] stumbles climbing down and the noise of [[Koya]]'s casting of feather fall alerts the enemies ending their ploy for surprise. Long and grueling fight ensues. There's flying. [[Zaiobe]] and [[Grayson]] carry us. [[Koya]] spends the entire time keeping [[Ochi]] alive. [[Kokinu]] is pretty much out of spells at this point and employs [[Dancing Wasp]] while [[Nindinzego]] flies high above casting down with a wand and nastier things. The party prevails. 

---

[[Zaiobe]] makes it clear that she currently means no harm to the party but considers [[Brinewall Keep]] to be her home and with no further common goal gives them 24 hours to conclude their business there before she will consider them tresspassers and slay them. The party thanks her and goes about just that.
After confirming the death of [[Nindinzego]] and [[Kokinu]] the party climbs up the two sheer drop offs constituting the way from the other dungeon related entrance. Faced with an Iron gate with a woman on it and funerary alcoves branching from the way in perpendicular fashion. Part of the room is collapsed and contains flowing motes of light. Knowledge these Alcoves contain the previous commanders of [[Brinewall]]
Still not having found anything they believe will help [[Ameiko]] they make sure they have searched the entire cavern system and dungeon under [[Brinewall Keep]]. They discover a secret sea cliff walk path that leads straight into the chamber that housed [[Nindinzego]]. 
Making their way back up to make sure they have cleared the ground floor they encounter [[Noe Icemark]], a short [[Varki]] woman with two shortswords at her sides, poking the dead bodies of the trogolodytes the party had killed in the "throne room". [[Noe]] Accompanies us after hearing our business because she loves a mystery. 
Proceeding to the back of the throne room they encounter the only door they had not yet explored due to chasing after [[Kokinu]] earlier. Using a skeleton key they aquired at some point they find It contains a hallway leading to stairs both down and up. As they enter soldiers of blood coagulate into being and instead of attacking thank the adventurers for the death of [[Kokinu]]. One of the next rooms greets them with a decrepit body opening the door which approaches [[Ochi]] and [[Grayson]] and attacks. After dispatching the [[Wight]] they enter the room he came from and find it to be an officers quarters in disarray as if raided or attacked. On the desk they find letters addressed to and from [[Andril Kortun]] the commander of [[Brinewall]]. The last of the letters is hastily scribbled and describing the attack on the keep by Ninja and [[Oni]].
The party returns the way it came and then takes the stairs leading downward. There are empty raided vaults here. An Ominous shadowy tian man confronts them. "I know this name" he says and screams in anguish. Weeping he begs them to "Take the seal away from here. Take it to my child." and disappears. Behind him is a Hidden door through which the party find 3 darkwood chests the left and right of which are locked. Opening the middle chest they find a complex and beautiful red and gold filigreed box radiating magic. it is a [[Warding Box]]. Once opened it blinds [[Ochi]] temporarily and the party detects something even more powerful inside. The source is a disc, The [[Amatatsu Seal]]. A vision overtakes the group.

### *Visions of Jade*
*An [[Oni]] army with burning skin, glaring eyes, and sharp tusks, wearing strange armor and wielding exotic weapons—emerge in a storm from a vast forest, then descend upon [[Minkai]]. This vision is swiftly followed by another: [[Emperor Shigure]] dressed in royal robes stands over a simple well, a friend at his side. Suddenly, the friend grows nearly three times in size and is sheathed in a frightening suit of jade armor. The [[Jade Warrior]] draws a sword and strikes down his royal friend, then holds the bloody sword aloft in triumph. A third vision follows, this time of [[Tsutoku Amatatsu]] a.k.a. [[Rokuro Kaijitsu]] handing the legendary sentient sword [[Things/Te No Sui]] to a richly dressed [[Ulfen]] man, [[Fynn Snaevald]], in exchange for a bag of gold to fund his families flight. Finally, this vision fades, and we see [[Ameiko Amatatsu]] waking from [[Ameiko's Possesion]] as the [[Kami]] possesing her flys back into the seal, but she is dressed in the finery of an empress. She rises from sleep not in [[The Caravan]], but from a resting spot within the arms of a jade throne.*

These visions pass in the span of a few heartbeats, and after they do, the [[Amatatsu Scions]] are left with the knowledge that they are just that, That [[Things/Te No Sui]] may have even more knowledge of the [[Amatatsu]]'s legacy, That [[Ameiko Amatatsu]] is the heir to the [[Amatatsu]] royal family and rightful heir of the [[Jade Throne]] of [[Minkai]], and that the [[Warding Box]] has protected the [[Amatatsu Seal]] from detection by the [[Oni of the Five Storms]] for this long and having the opened it they have revealed themselves to great danger.
With this knowledge the party opens the other chests finding more treasures that appear tailored to their strengths and quickly gather up those items and the [[Warding Box]] to make haste back to [[The Caravan]] and [[Ameiko]]. They discover quite quickly that she is waiting for them back in the throne room. She confirms she also shared in the vision. [[Ochi]] swears himself to her service and in gratitude and her newfound right grants him the title of [[Samurai]]. [[Shoko]] Warns her that she can throw the [[Warding Box]] into the sea and forget it all. [[Ameiko]] says she cannot stand by and allow the suffering under the [[Jade Regent]]. [[Noe]] asks what she will do. She believes her responsibility to the [[Minkai]]an people too great in spite of no wish to rule.
With all of these thoughts weighing on the party they make their way back to [[The Caravan]] where they determine they will head north to [[Kalsgard]] to inquire after the sword [[Things/Te No Sui]] and the way further north to [[The Crown of the World]] and the northern passage to [[Minkai]]. After that is determined they ask more of [[Noe]]'s reasons for being at [[Brinewall]]. She says she is from very far north. Went south for "Mother's interest in chronicalling knowledge". Mother sent her to "learn about her own culture." With all the sharing going around and various bits of [[Minkai]]an spoken [[Ochi]] notices [[Shoko]] speaks the tongue as well and asks how he came to be in [[Varisia]] being from [[Minkai]] himself. [[Shoko]] says he "came here a long time ago after altercation back in [[Minkai]] and was saved by [[Koya]] when in trouble here." All the while [[Grayson]] shares hot food and strong drink with [[Kelda Oxgutter]] once again keeping up the groups hospitality. With that the party retires and rests with a long journey ahead of them.

### Rest

Those on watch hear the scrape of wood on sandy gravel as a longship beaches on the shores near [[The Caravan]]. Having been detected the [[Ulfen]] Raider's let loose cries and set upon the camp. The Scions rouse and arm themselves to take up the defense as well as [[Ameiko]], [[Sandru]], [[Koya]], and [[Kelda]]. [[Ochi]] rushes to aid [[Koya]] in her caravan after seeing several raiders enter as he does he spies a large peculiar [[Raven]] with a red feather on it's breast which flies off into the night when spotted. The fight ends with the capture of one of the [[Ulfen]]. The party determines to interrogate him. When he is less than forthcoming [[Ochi]] threatens to tie stones to the mans feet and send him into the river he came from. The man begins bleeding from his eyes and ears and quickly dies. Confused the party see if the man lives and search his body. They discover a symbol branded on his chest and identify it as a [[Blood Geas]], A mark left by the weapon [[Oathtaker]] a Tetsubo. After discussing they also determine that the longship bearing their attackers is the [[Arl's Hammer]] belonging to [[Asvig Longthews]]. Some in the party share that he is the husband of [[Characters/6 Kalsgard NPCs/Helva/Helva]] who is the real power between the two and a powerful witch. Pondering the thought of a powerful necromancer against them and the mysterious [[Raven]] as well as the social and politcal implications of this attack they make a plan to split their forces to enter [[Kalsgard]] in a way to be both less and more conspicuous to draw danger away from [[Ameiko]].
Come morning with their plan in action they draw near to the city aboard the [[Arl's Hammer]] when a strange golden [[Flying Monkey]] lands upon the bow of the boat. Calmly smoking a pipe, He is unresponsive to their questions or actions at first. Soon however the [[Xiao]] communicates to them that he is named [[Wei Yan]] and that he is an emissary of [[Shizuru]] come to watch over [[Ameiko]]. With this new addition they seek out a place to stay and gather information. Over a mix of [[Tian]] and [[Ulfen]] food and drink they as the tavern keep if there is anyone who could guide them north. They are recommended [[Ulf Gormunder]] or his apprentice [[Ukshaka]]. They also inquire about [[Fynn Snaevald]] and where he can be found. They determine to speak to [[Fynn]] first and set out for his house.
Before reaching their destination the come to a bridge with two statues on the siderails. Upon crossing the statues come to life and attack them. They dispatch them fairly easily. Afterwards they find the traces of the sigils that constituted a trap that must have been laid for them.
Continuing on to the ex-trader's house they are greeted by his house servant and welcomed in. They introduce themselves and their reason for visiting. [[Fynn]] tells them he no longer has [[Things/Te No Sui]]. He kept it all this time and had always planned to return it to [[Rokuro]] but he never returned. He had housed and fed [[Rokuro]] during his families flight and wished them well. About two weeks past thugs in all black dress broke in and stole it leaving only a black [[Raven]] feather behind. [[Noe]] thinks these are the signs of the [[Frozen Shadows]]. [[Ochi]] shows [[Fynn]] the swords he got from the secret third [[Vault]], [[Fynn]] admires them and thanks him. At this time a page arrives bearing a scroll for [[Fynn]]. It contains a declaration of a blood feud between [[Fynn]] and [[Asvig Longthews]] over unpaid wereguilt. At this point the party decides they need to pay [[Asvig]] a visit.
Sharing all knowledge they have or have gathered on him they focus on the news that they are feasting in celebration of a funeral. [[Snorri Stoneye]] the mad reaver has just passed. He was a very powerful raider who plundered the [[Sotlands]] to the south financed by the [[Rimerunners]]. He fell ill on a recent journey and died very quickly. His assets were sold back to the [[Rimerunners]] before he was even fully dead.
They arrive at the [[Asvig]]'s hall and opt for stealth and reconaissance. Listening at different points of entry and examining the area they determine there are a large number of [[Ulfen]] raiders present and return to town to gather more fighters from [[The Caravan]]. Returning in greater force [[The Caravan]]eers debate points of entry and whether or not to burn their enemies out finally deciding on storming the rear entrance in force. Making their way in they dispatch a few who are harrassing the kitchen help whom they detain and question. Not finding much information they continue into the long hall where they come upon the scene of [[Characters/6 Kalsgard NPCs/Helva/Helva]] bedding raiders in celebration with many drunken others passed out about the place. [[Asvig]] and those coherent charge and the [[Witch]] starts working magics. Beating down the sober, slaying [[Asvig]], and holding [[Characters/6 Kalsgard NPCs/Helva/Helva]] at swordpoint they question her. 

---

She tells them that they stole the sword and an older/middle aged tian woman who walked like a figher paid them well for it. They hid the sword in a place no one will ever find it again. inferring the worst the scions belive they have put the sword aboard [[Snorri's Funeral Ship]]. the scions press [[Helva]] further and she relays that they did not kill [[Snorri Stoneye]] nor were they the ones who left a feather after stealing [[Things/Te No Sui]]. [[Helva]] having shared this information attempts to kill [[Noe]] and [[Ochi]] intervenes preventing a 1 on 1 fight. As [[Helva]] passes strange and ominous flames forming a death's head rise from her corpse in the mark of [[Urgathoa]]. The remaing living raiders are offered work with the caravan and head back to join up. Determined to find [[Snorri's Funeral Ship]] the party quickly heads south and find [[Ukshaka]], [[Ulf Gormunder]]'s apprentice asking us to find him and if we can to bring him to [[Yin Po]] at the shrine of [[Shelyn]] in the [[Fire Quarter]]. [[Ukshaka]] tells the party the location of spear shatter harbor. After finding the location of the ship and with the notion that the missing [[Ulf Gormunder]] may be aboard along with the sword they make haste. As they approach those with knowledge of the procedure of these cultural funeral ships share it. Taking three small boats out to ferry they party they close on the funeral ship but are interrupted by a giant crab intent on feasting on them. They dispatch it and board.
[[Ochi]] quickly disables the time released fire starting method. The pass up the body on the pyre and head below decks finding it piled high with treasures but hearing the sounds of movement and chains rattling in the dark. Chained on a long lead is the dead [[Snorri Stoneye]] who is now a draugr. As they discover this there is a commotion above decks and peering back up they find [[Wei Yan]] unconscious and [[Ameiko]] missing and several figures garbed in black poised to attack as lightining unexpectedly strikes the ship setting it ablaze. Most of the party scrambles to get back above decks to recover [[Ameiko]] and [[Grayson]] fells the unliving [[Snorri]] below and quickly searches for [[Things/Te No Sui]] and [[Ulf]]. Those above dispatch the [[Frozen Shadows]] assaulting them and [[Grayson]] find neither objects of his search but instead finds [[Zio]] bound and gagged and a strange [[Talking Helmet]]. Releasing him and making haste back up and off the ship the fire is staunched and they turn to questioning the one ninja they had not killed who quickly chooses death by leaping into the deep over betrayal.
Finding [[Ameiko]] nowhere in sight and none of what they came for the scions regroup sailing back to shor. Introducing himself [[Helgarval]] shares that he is was a familiar to a wizard who died and is now stranded on the material plane. He has spent a great deal of time following the movements of the [[Frozen Shadows]] since. On the way back to [[Kalsgard]] they discuss the [[Frozen Shadows]] hunting them and their knowledge of the group with [[Helgarval]] sharing that they have been using the [[Rimerunners]] as a front for the last few years.
With few leads the scions make way to the [[Kalsgard Shelyn Temple]] which they find crumbling and burning on their approach with screams coming from inside. Entering they see an Earth elemental standing over the body of an injured priest and hear

> <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"Leave the priest, Kill them"</mark>

screeched from somwhere in the dark. The party engages the earthen behemoth while the voice from the dark urges it to kill them. During the fight it is identified as the [[Red Feather Raven]] that has been ahead of them at every turn. [[Grayson]] gifts several arrows to it before it flees as the group reduces the earth elemental to dust.
[[Shoko]] asks the priest what happened and he says it was basically all a blur the [[Red Feather Raven]] appeared and suddenly the earth elemental was there and destroying the place. He doesn' think it was a normal raven. [[Grayson]] agrees pointing out that he put two arrows into it and it didn't even slow it down. We make sure that priest is alright and then show him the token [[Ukshaka]] told us to present to him. [[Yin Po]] says "I see. Of course. Come with me" and shows them to the safehouse in the garden shed. On the way [[Ochi]] expresses they've been looking for [[Ulf]] but have been unable to locate him. Arriving [[Yin Po]] shows them a secret door inside the shed revealing the [[Shelyn Temple Safehouse]]. The door is currently destroyed. The party notices a large black feather on the floor they believe could only come from a [[Tengu]] as well as a dart from a blowgun. [[Noe]] examines it and determines it is dosed with blue winnis poison she describes it as standard protocol for the [[Frozen Shadows]] any targets they don't want to kill and draw suspicion to lower profile targets they'll dose with this and this is likely what knocked out [[Wei Yan]] on the [[Funeral Ship]]. Further searching the cellar they find no other trace of [[Ukshaka]]. Discussing the state of their mission they lament the fact that their enemies now hold [[Ameiko]] as well as both of their possible guides for the northern passage. [[Noe]] points out that Blue Winnis is very hard to cultivate and should make very easy ties to their foes once they can locate a source. Left with only the [[Rimerunners]] guild as a possible lead they determine they desperately need to investigate. [[Noe]] shares that it is located in the [[Jade Quarter]]. [[Helgarval]] adds that they have been extremely active recently. The party heads toward the [[Ivory Quarter]] to find accomodation and further plan their reconnaisance. Upon approach [[Koya]] is nearly killed in an ambush from an [[Ulfen]] archer on the tavern balcony. Closing quickly and chasing her down when she flees [[Ochi]] and [[Noe]] corner [[Hekja]] in the alley and intimidate her into surrendering. Finding no amount of pay worth her life she begins sharing what she knows. She was hired by [[Jorgun the Axe]] a [[Werebear]] under a [[Blood Geas]] to kill at least one of the [[The Caravan]] to reduce our number. After accepting the contract [[Hekja]] tailed him, a good habit in her profession, as he traveled north away from the city. [[Noe]] infers from this that the only suitable location to the north that the [[Frozen Shadows]] could be operating out of is [[Ravens Cragg]], a naturally and artificially fortified fortress that belonged to [[Snorri Stoneye]] north of [[Kalsgard]]. Before she can share much more information however a hand sprout from her throat spraying gore out just as [[Ochi]] and [[Noe]] were offering [[Hekja]] freedom.

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Thats about what i was expecting"</mark> -[[Noe]]
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">"You dissapoint me student"</mark> -Ninja
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Sensei"</mark> -[[Noe]]

The party confused at first in the clash ask if this is someone they shouldn't be killing and [[Noe]] assures them that they want her dead. The woman is able to appear and disaapear at will making for a very difficult fight which ends with the scions still breathing and a retreating foe as well as dead assassin and a poisoned shuriken buried in the alley wall. The woman runs up the side of the building and disappears across the rooftops as [[Noe]] gives chase up the side of the building losing sight of her. The caravaneers take stock of the throwing star left behind as well as the orginal assassins horse. Understandably having many questions for her [[Noe]] urges the party not to do so in the open so they head inside the inn for some privacy. [[Noe]] informs them of her history with the [[Frozen Shadows]] a la her parentage and her tutelage under [[Omeyani]], the one who addressed her as student a short time ago. She also tells them the mastermind behind this particular band of assassins is [[Kimmendatsu]] who reports to the [[Oni of the Five Storms]]. With their foe's strength becoming clearer they also discuss [[Ravens Cragg]]. [[Noe]] notes it is a likely locale for them as most in the area only travel north to take the northern passage, The [[Path of Agenhai]]. She also reveals her true name to be [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki]], that her father is the head of some even more serious and sinister operation he was called away from the [[Frozen Shadows]] for, and that her mother [[Kireama]] took her away. [[Kireama]] was the reason she was at [[Brinewall]], sent to gain an understaning of her own family history or legacy. [[Noe]] decided then not to kill us and thus damned herself to be an enemy of her former organization. She shares some more nitty gritty on the [[Frozen Shadows]] combat abilities such as most of their number cannot perform ninjutsu like she or [[Omeyani]], and that the [[Red Feather Raven]] is somehow associated and working on their behalf or at least for mutual benefit. She assures the group that the [[Rimerunners]] guild office will hold more information for them.


### Rest
---

Having learned all that the party determines they need rest before they act and that they will take watches and recuperate at an inn in the [[Ivory Quarter]] while [[Noe]] does some reconaissance on the [[Rimerunners]]. In the morning the party does some shopping on the way to prepare for some of the tricks that they've seen from the [[Frozen Shadows]] so far.
While this is going [[Noe]] is carefully watching the [[Rimerunners]] building noting the points of egress and the guards number and shift changes. Only one windows is boarded up and barred. With careful prodding she finds an easy way in and finds herself in an empty office. FInding nothing of interest she continues on to more rooms peering through a keyhole she passes on a room with two lounging guards for a different locked one and picks the lock. It appears to be a storage closet at first but after careful searching she finds a secret door behind a panel. Inside she finds a trapdoor in the floor to another storage location, this one containing a heavy iron lockbox against the north wall. After bypassing the lock on that as well she finds it contains two thousand gold pieces as well as some very importnat looking ledgers and paperwork. Gathering these pilfered treasures up and peering through another portal she decides she's risked enough on her own and makes a mental note of the secret rooms location and carefully covers her tracks and makes her exit. Returning to the others flipping some of her spoils she, [[Ochi]], and [[Shoko]] gather everyone to go over [[Noe]]'s findings.
The [[Stolen Documents]] confirm that the [[Arl's Hammer]] was rented to [[Asvig Longthews]] on the night of the attack at [[Skalsbridge]] and also that he was contracted by the [[Rimerunners]] to aquire a [[Tian]] artifact from a specific address recognizable as [[Fynn Snaevald]]'s home. They also detail financial transactions of large sums over the last few years to [[Ravens Cragg]] including the artifact which is likely [[Things/Te No Sui]]. All of these orders were approved by someone called [[Thorborg Silverskorr]] who is apparently the owner of the [[Rimerunners]]. Also included is the purchase of [[Ravens Cragg]] from [[Snorri]] several years ago.
While the group is pondering these revelations and confirmations [[Shoko]] raises the idea of using some of this information as a bargaining chip, taking these damning documents and meeting with the [[Rimerunners]] and using them to barter to get [[Ukshaka]] back, assuming that if they don't outright have her there then they'll know her location and we can liberate her without any bloodshed. The others are amenable to this idea.
As they approach the [[Rimerunners]] guild office [[Noe]] Hangs back to watch for any deceit from the guild from a rooftop across the street. The rest of the group walks straight in not being stopped by the guard outside and after some strong words to the clerk from [[Shoko]] in spite of a failed "appointment" ruse [[SIlverskorr]] agrees to see them.
[[Thorborg Silverskorr]] is right through the office door and is apparently a beautiful [[Ulfen]] woman. She asks after the mysterious item we've brought her and [[Shoko]] goes into the notion of our exchange, [[Ukshaka]] for the [[Stolen Documents]]. [[SIlverskorr]] plays dumb at first but when we mention the [[Shelyn Temple Safehouse]] and the probablilty of [[Ukshaka]] being brought here she says we might be correct. At this point we have [[Grayson]] pass the [[Stolen Documents]] forward and flash them to her and repeat the terms of the exchange. "So you're offering the documents that [[Noe]] -excuse me- [[Hatsuyuki]] (spoken in perfect tian) stole in the night?" Meanwhile [[Noe]] is across the street watching this conversation through the barred window to the office. [[Shoko]] feigns ignorance and calls out the womans feigned ignorance of the whereabouts of the guide's apprentice.
><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"We could both leave here with what we want"</mark> -[[Shoko]]
><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"We could.... but.... what makes you think you're going to be leaving here alive"</mark> - [[Thorborg Silverskorr]]

she emphasizes that we're in a building full of her guards.
The group attempts to diffuse with diplomacy while [[Hatsuyuki]] notices a rusted iron-bound massive club under the office desk. As [[Shoko]]'s speech ends [[SIlverskorr]]'s appearance ripples and changes as she transforms.

As the battle begins [[Ochi]] turns to [[Shoko]] and says

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"I'm so sorry you were right."</mark>

[[Ochi]] is able to immediately identify [[SIlverskorr]]'s new appearance as an [[Oni]] and an [[Ogre]] at that. The party including [[Koya]] battles it out against the [[Ogre]], [[Omeyani]], and the [[Rimerunners]] guards. [[Grayson]] firing arrows left and right, [[Zio]] nearly freezing [[Omeyani]] in one shot right away. As [[Noe]] closes in having recognized the danger she also recognizes the transformed [[SIlverskorr]] as [[Kimmendatsu]] and says 

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Hi boss"</mark> 

and [[Kimmendatsu]] grins back at her. Still smiling she attempts to obliterate [[Shoko]] who was left in the office alone with her but he skillfully dodges and deflects all her deadly blows. [[Ochi]] having challenged [[Kimmendatsu]] but not wanting to engage in such close quarters yells for [[Shoko]] to retreat out of the room just as [[Zio]] is nearly cleaved in half by a guard's greatsword attack. [[Noe]] having closed into the room in the fray and spotting her sensei [[Omeyani]] says 

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">''where are you master"</mark>

and crushes a charm in her fist and spots her magically undetected behind a very wounded [[Zio]]. [[Zio]] having planned ahead for this appears to explode into glitter revealing [[Omeyani]]'s position and retreating to safety outside magically. [[Omeyani]] Recognizes she's been had and beings making several hand signs appearing to split in two which is just in time as [[Noe]] appears and takes several swings at her, evaporating her newly made twin. [[Omeyani]] greets her with a 

><mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">"Hello student"</mark> 

proving she can see [[Noe]] just as well as [[Omeyani]] can see her. Just when the odds are beginning to favor the scions however [[Kimmendatsu]] finally connects with [[Shoko]] powerfully on the backswing of another miss and he falls unconscious to the ground. [[Ochi]] sees this and tries to make his way to [[Shoko]] and fells another guard. [[Noe]] attempts to return [[Omeyani]]'s poisoned shuriken from the encounter in the alley but she catches it in midair. [[Grayson]] sinks some more arrows into [[Omeyani]] before she can escape as [[SIlverskorr]] shifts back into her smaller human form and tries to do the same.
[[Shoko]] having been revived by [[Koya]] is able to stand but not fast enough to chase down the retreating shapeshifter. [[Ochi]] hesitates temporarily over the multiple people bleeding out on the office floor but ultimately gives chase and strikes her another time with his blade and says 

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> "Where are you going? We're not done"</mark>
   <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"We are done for now."</mark> 

[[Noe]] catches up as well in a graceful flash. [[Kimmendatsu]] smiles at her seeming to be enjoying this. 

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Come on now, you haven't been put through the wrenches since what, last time my old man was around here? you'll be fine"</mark>-[[Noe]]
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"It has been some time since i fought opponents who were worthy"</mark> -[[Kimmendatsu]]
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"But you're still losing"</mark> -N 
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"Am i losing?"</mark> -K

[[Noe]] brandishes her oni bane wakizashi at [[Kimmendatsu]] who promises all her new friends will die if she uses that on her as he hand coaleseces with ice. [[Noe]] ponders for a long moment before sheathing the weapon and stepping aside. [[Ochi]] does not attempt to stop her either.

><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"Good Choice"</mark> -[[Kimmendatsu]]

She takes literal flight and departs. [[Wodes]] accompanies her from the railing
[[Koya]] magically heals [[Shoko]]'s wounds and [[Ochi]] starts checking on those not standing back in the front office primarily [[Omeyani]] as he begins to attempt to save her [[Noe]] approaches and stomps on her neck extinquishing her former masters life.

>*<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"I had questions for her"</mark>* - O

Frowning Deeply

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Oh, Dear"</mark> - N 
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Do you think the guards know anything?"</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I'm going to take it on faith that they didnt even know that their boss was, well, my boss."</mark> - N 

Waving her hand nonchalantly.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"I wanted to find out if Ameiko is still alive"</mark> - O 

Frowning still.

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Maybe she could have said somethign to you but frankly I don't know how much of it would have been useful unless you have ways of detecting people who can lie."</mark> - N 

as she pulls omeyani's clothes back to reveal a lack of a blood geas.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Is Everyone okay? Shoko you took quite a beating how are you feeling"</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"Augh, Like i just spent a night in the single worst bar in--- where are we again?, About that bad" </mark>- S
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Well you're still alive so if i may offer a personal insight i'd say you haven't been to the worst bar in Kalsguard Also, you took Oathtaker directly to the face and survived. So I am genuinely impressed"</mark> - N

Ochi passes Shoko a few potions of cure light.

The party then does inventory of the room and bodies finding on omeyani 2 doses of deathblade, 1 dose of black lotus extract, her dagger deadly kiss, 3 earthfire shuriken, 1 +1 flaming burst shuriken, a blowgun with 10 darts, 5 shuriken, masterwork thieves tools, and her garb the Shozoku of the Night Wind. On the others they find fairly expected weapons and armor and not much else. 

Hearing the commotion downstairs but having been too slow to react several more guards from upstairs make their way the the ground floor and upon seeing what they find to be no longer their business quickly and politely depart. 

Ochi turns toward the others as this occurs
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">*"Do we want to hire them?"*</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">*"Do you really want someone who's going to run away at the first sign of a massive violence"* </mark>- N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">*"That's fair. But we do have a habit of picking up people who used to work for those that we just fought and bringing them with us right Noe?"*</mark> - O 
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">*"What?"*</mark> - S Simulatneously <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">*"I Know it terrifies me"*</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"We did that once i wouldn't call that a habit"</mark> - S
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"No, we have the Ulfen Raiders and we have Noe"</mark> - O Smiling
She puts up a single finger. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"To be fair, though You didn't exactly know that until fairly recently and you haven't kicked me out yet. So, I can only assume that you're either putting up with me or plotting to have me thrown in the river by the end of the evening, but I'm hoping for the first one."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Your insider knowledge has been absolutely invaluable. Noe. That's is all I am saying"</mark> - O 
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"It has to be. If I don't tell you, I'm gonna die with it."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well, we have no one to ask any questions of and I think we know where we're headed."</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Not unless you know how to talk to the dead. I'm afraid."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"Are we certain that Ushaka's not here."</mark> - G
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"That is an excellent point Grayson perhaps we should take a better look around."</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"Lets search the building."</mark> - S 

They find a clerk who is still in the building who shares Ukshakas location with them being the room with the boarded up windows. Inside they find her bound and gagged.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"We've been looking everywhere for you."</mark> - O.
She mumbles in response. Ochi frees her. 
"You have my thanks for freeing me." - Ukshaka
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"No, thanks necessary. We desperately need your help."</mark> - O
"Have you found any news of [Ulf]?" - Ukshaka
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"We found zero trace of news of Ulf and we've looked quite a few places dangerous ones at that. Are you well, Did they harm you?"</mark> - O
"Not beyond the beating they gave me to steal me... with many strange large bird men." - U
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Strange how?"</mark> - O
"Well to be fair. They all looked like you, but they were all wearing these black pajamas." - U
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Please don't call them pajamas."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Those are in fashion lately."</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"I need to get some of those too"</mark> - S
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Do you know how many years you need to study before you actually earn a Shozoku?"</mark> - N
Shoko just stares knowingly.
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well Ukshaka I'm not sure how much you know but from things we found here, and various other interactions with our pajama friends, We believe that they're holding our friend and Ulf at Ravenscrag."</mark> -O
"Hmm, I know the way. I could show it to you." - U
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"You would take us there? We could use your help"</mark> - O
"If they have captured Ulf Of course." - U
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well then I think it settled. I think we should make our way there. Maybe we could do some reconnaissance again. These are very very dangerous enemies we are facing"</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"How, how long is the trip there?"</mark> - G
"Two days walk south of Kalsgard toward those grey hills there. One by horse. The way is boggy with shale hillocks. I will take you there and fight with you, for Ulf." - U

The party plans and shops.

During this time Noe attempts to get graysons blood to use as a basis for antitoxins against the poisons we've seen the frozen shadows use so far but he refuses
Later Shoko pulls Noe aside
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"Um when we're doing this, when we're assaulting your former clan, are you sure? We might have to kill everyone in there."</mark> - S
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Oh, I'm very much counting on that you do."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"There's nobody want us to try and set aside. No one. You want us to try and spare?"</mark> - S
Noe stops, takes off her glasses and ponders the question while cleaning them putting them back on
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I want you to kill them so thoroughly that Pharasma will not recognize their souls when they go for judgment. They're that kind of people. So, no, I don't want you to save anyone. Ameiko of course that's kind of the whole point of this But the rest? they know what they signed up for"</mark> - N
Shoko nods.
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I appreciate that you ask though really."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"It's hard thing when we're about to do, but we gotta"</mark> - S

Reaching a defensible clearing the party decides they should rest to be better prepared for the dangers to come but not before an ocre jelly emerges from under the bridge they camp near and attacks them. Shoko recognizes the creature and relays to the party 
that cutting or stabbing the creature has little effect except to cause it to split into copies of itself creating more enemies.

	1. 
	Zio attacks with sonic blast which seems effective
	Shoko creates illusionary copies of himself and charges it.
	Ochi fires an arrow out of his sleeve which causes the ooze to duplicate.
	Ukshaka charges it.
	Grayson flying kicks his way in and decimates one of the oozes
	ooze attacks shoko dispelling an image
	2. 
	Zio fires a blast of heat from his hands on the remaining ooze
	shoko adopts a defensive stance.
	Ochi closes the gap and strikes it with his staff.

Ochi wipes his weapon clean in the grass.

"Nice Kick Grayson" - O elbowing Noe "What did i tell you look at those kicks"
"Fucking terrifying, Grayson remind me again, Where did you learn how to do that?" -N
"no need to remind you. I never told you in the first place" - G
"Yeah, that was kind of the hint. I was gonna be, you know, like decent about it. But seriously, What school are you from?" - N
"I learned it in my Clan hold and then a lot of practicing with Shelalu" - G
"Interesting don't believe i've ever heard of Dwarven-based martial arts but it makes sense, you know? I just expected. It would be more... She makes a motion arounds graysons outline and then almost picks it up and throws it.
"I was expecting more of that from dwarven martial arts" - N

While this conversation was happening shoko strokes his chin over the remains of the defeated jelly.
"I think I think that might have been a surprise left for us by the shadows. In which case, if this is their idea of a trap, then I don't think we have much to worry about from their trappings of the castle" - S

Ukshaka had made herself busy through this conversation as well readying a place for a fire and with help from Ochi who had began gathering wood.

Noe queiting surveyed the area noticing very large bird footprints alongside human prints.
Ochi sees her staring once the fire is started and also gazes upon them ponderously 
"That is a good number of them. We should definitely set watches tonight. I don't to get any closer until we've had some rest."

Shoko takes notice and mutters some words under his breath and waving his hands lets out a bird call loud and clear.
As he does this hundreds and hundreds of ravens swirl towards them from out of the surrounding trees landing nearby. 
As they come to rest. One answers shoko.
"Yes, You are being hunted."
"You would be hunted now if our master knew you called us. *they know they know they know they know*"
"Your cousins are weird Ochi." - N
"So are yours." - O

The party determines a watch order and sets to bed.

In the night on Graysons watch he notices bird footprints appear in the snow one by one and hears a twig snap on the other side of camp.
Ochi also notices footprints in another location.

	1. 
	Grayson reaches down and picks up a handful of snow and flings it at one of the sets of foot prints shouting "Ambush!" and follows the snowball with an arrow.  As the rest of the party begins waking from his call Ochi dodges a stab from an invisible attacker whos illusion melts away into the visage of a somehow blurry tengu ninja.
	Shoko who was still sleeping is woken as another assailant sinks their blade into him.
	The first one to alert Grayson closes on him but misses his strike. 
	Ochi tries to grab the assassin closest to him so he can't lose track of him and fails.
	Another bird ninja scores a vicious blow against zio before he can react.
	1. 
	Grayson fills the closest enemy with several arrows felling him.
	Shoko counters his assailant but misses holding his deadly spell in his hand.
	Koya taps Zio with her want reviving him somewhat.
	Ukshaka gets to her feet and readies her weapon.
	Noe being roused as well readies her weapons and steps into the darkness vanishing from sight.
	The Tengu closest to her steps away from the place Noe melted into the darkness and pulls out a blowgun.
	The tengu who had already buried his wakizashi in Shoko once continues trying to eviscerate shoko and scores another devastating attack on him.
	Zio gains his feet only to be struck by the shadow nearest him. Zio responds by drawing his mace and striking back.
	Wei yan cannot connect with a tengu he tries to attack.
	Ochi abandons his plan to grapple the tengu drawing his weapons and slashes the tengu.
	The tengu nearest zio stabs him twice and zios health is drained.
	Helgarval tries to strike a ninja and misses.
	3. 
	Grayson fires another blazing fast volley at the bird engaged with zio.
	Shoko finally connects with his spell and stands up while his opponent is distracted by his magic.
	Ukshaka swings her sword and strikes the tengu again.
	A sword appears out of the chest of one of the tengu and Noe appears behind him pulling it free and letting it fall to the ground.
	The rattled recipient of Shokos spell tries to back up but in his unpreparedness is struck by Wei-Yan and barely missed by Shoko.
	Zio pulls a wand out firing magical missiles at the fleeing avian.
	Wei-Yan gives chase and strikes him again.
	Ochi cirlces around and cuts off his retreat but fails to connect.
	Grayson refrains from ending the fleeing ninja with an arrow seeing Ochi attempting to knock him unconcious.
	Shoko catches up to the fray and strikes the Tengu in the back of the head felling him.
	Ochi picks him up and carries him back to the fire to be questioned.
	
	Zio is coughing during this. Noe notices and checks the dart in the snow confirming it is poisoned and pulls a vial from her haori and doses Zio with it who seems to recover.
	
	While the poison seems to have run it's course Zio seems worse for the wear. Koya digs in her pack and pulls out a scroll and performs a divine ritual quickly beseeching Desna and restoring Zios vigor.

Ochi says a prayer to Hei Feng over the deceased tengu lying in the snow and he and Noe begin moving the bodies away from camp searching them in the process. After which Ochi helps Shoko back to caravan to finish resting. Looking at the weapons they carried they realize just how much danger they were in. Noe pockets the remaining doses. Koya takes a sip of vodka by the fire before shuffling off the administer to Shoko.
"Just to avoid that happening so badly again" - N Noe tosses him one of the charms she is wearing about her neck.
Ochi recognizes it as the charm she crushed when they fought Omeyani.
Noe explains how it works and how to activate it to him.
He thanks her and the party beds down for the night.

---

In the morning the caravaneers make their way the rest of the way to Ravenscragg. They come upon the structure towering up on a cliff consisting of a large hall and tower silent except for the caw of the mass of ravens adorning the roofs, eaves and railings. The way up is a narrow wooden stairway winding up the cliff 90 feet in switchback fashion. In some places the stair is anchored directly into the rock face and others they are suspended upon supports and buttresses driven into the rock. Lichen and moss cover the stairs and rocks with pale vines roots and blooms of Nightshade, Willow herb, and Bog Tea sprouting from the occasional crevice in the stone.

"We should be wary of traps" - N
"I think this is one of the rare times i agree with Noe" - G
"Well, there's nowhere to go but up. Do you want to look around? See if there's another way. I have a feeling. This is gonna be our only method of egress." - O
"I can go and take a look from the top if you'd prefer and see if there's anything on the way down."
"Information would be good. There's not many ways to retreat here." - O
"Yeah don't get yourself too badly harmed." - N

Noe takes a few steps forward and dissapears instantly from sight. They party cannot see her but she climbs straight up the cliff using her supernatural abilities and circumvents much of the stairway. She scouts the landing and sees a place where the rock creates a landing upon wich a small hollow is plastered over with what appears to be a huge wasps nest. Noe makes a mental note of that.

"How's it looking up there?" - O
"How much do you like wasps?" - N
"They can be really tasty actually, Kind of Spicy" - O
"... " - N

Noe continues her survey of the area as she makes her way back down the stair looking for traps. Upon returning to the party she puts a hand on Ochi and Ukshaka's Shoulders.

"It's more or less fine with exception of teh creepy looking wasp nest that looks big enough for me to walk into." - N
" *Son of a bitch* " - Ukshaka in Varki whos hand is on her sword
"Sorry she just kind of does that" - O
"You should not do that when we hunt those of your kind." - Ukshaka
"No, but you probably should have seen me coming" - N
"I do not have a way to see that which is unseen." Ukshaka
"Well lets march on shall we." - O

And they make their way up the stairs finding no traps on their way and arriving at the rock landing and the strange insectoid mass. Ochi steps closer to try to examine it while still tens of feet away but before he can infer anything a spider eater with a pincered face, pincered hands and a stinger emerges from the mass. Ochi recognizes the beast and relays to the party the dangers it poses including a poison that paralyzes unhale victims for weeks at a time and the reproductive method of implating it's young inside those it paralyzes.

It lunges before anyone can react baring pincers and stinger scoring multiple hits on Ochi who is unprepared. Ochi stealing himself against this onlaught and though he has clearly been stung by the creature he doesn't seem overly hurt.
Koya attempted to strike it and missed.
Noe does the same and strikes true flaying the creature then vanishes.
Ochi having recuperated somewhat also attempts to stab him adopting a defensive stance and strikes true on the slightly weakened spider eater.
Grayson from the rear fires a flurry of arrows ending the spider eaters existence.

"I don't feel great Koya. Could you help me?" - O
"Given the color of these that's coming out of your sting hole there might I suggest chugging these anti-toxins." - N *tinking as small bottles hit the wooden walkway they stand on*

After having seen the first of the defenses of Ravenscragg Grayson Focuses his inner energies for a moment and his skin darkens.

"We should be very careful. If this was the front guard, they these things can paralyze you. I don't know how I fought it off but these are very dangerous defensive measures." - O
"I bet they don't get lots of solicitors." - G
"Thank you for healing me by the way Koya" - O
"Of course darling. Thank you for never... being boring." - Koya
"See Koya gets it." - N

The adventurers make their way further up the walkway and come upon a wide porch surmounting the rickety conglomeration of stairs and landings below providing a panoramic view of the boggy plains that extend to the hazy horizon. The looming green-grey stone hall of the fortress blocks further progress. Inset arrow slits with heavy wooden shutters flank a bronze banded portal that leads within above three more arrow slits look out over the precipice. Upon this fortress porch more of the avian assassins await the rescuers.

Grayson, more than prepared, sinks several arrows into the foremost frosty shadow who slumps to the planks. 
"I don't think they are here to welcome us." - G
Wei yan quickly pounces along the railing to close on another.
Ukshaka draws her sword and shield and steps into the fray.
The feathered defenders step forward and vanish.
One of them appears and strikes at Ukshaka and connects but ukshaka seems to have weathered the attack well.
Ochi charges another screaming "Where is Lady Ameiko?!" and attempt to feint and strike making a pitiful show in his emotional state.
Helgarval spouts a gout of flame from his visor onto one of the Tengu.
Noe slashes at the Tengu nearest her and cuts it down and vanishes from sight again.
Grayson sends another volley felling the last of the feathered foes.

Ochi continues on rushed in his fervor to find Ameiko "Let's go!" - O

Rows of pillars support the 40-foot high roof of this long hall torches set into pillars sconces and two fire pits set with iron spits in the center of the rust strewn floor give the room a ruddy glow. Several doors open into rooms on either side beneath 10 foot high balconies lined with feasting tables. At the far end of the hall a 15-foot high balcony with the master's high table looks out over all. Smoke holes cut into the roof high above allow in more light, and the croaking of the many ravens that roost on the roofs ridge pole.

"That's a lot of options on where to go." - G
"Check em all." - N
"We may as well start searching." - O

Ochi walks up to the first door on the right and looks back at Noe and turns back to the door and looks it over for signs of traps. He sees nothing suspicious and opens it. Inside he finds a guard room empty save for rocks and piles of broken rubble. 

"Nothing in here." - O

Grayson opens the opposing door across the hall and sees a very similar guard room in a similar state.
The party continues down the long hall. When they arrive near the center the ravens in the roof and rafters take wing closing in on the invaders.
"So this is where Shoko summoned them from." - G *readying his bow*


	1. 
	
	Noe draws one of her blades and slashes and punches at the assailing murder immediately knocking some of them out of the air.
	Zio recites an incantation and performs some arcane movements with his hands.

	A door bursts open next to Ochi surprising him and revealing another Tengu who looks equally surprised at the scene before him.
	Another tengu appears and stabs Ochi.
	Grayson takes note of more Tengu appearing to the south from doors further down the long hall and attempts to keep them from joining the fray with surpressing fire stepping between shots toward his targets.
	Helgarval mimics Wei Yan and roasts the unprepared ravens.
	Someone fires an arrow Ochi but narrowly misses. 
	Ochi is blocking a doorway still stemming the flow of Ninja from one of the rooms. 
	
	2. 
	
	Noe strikes out with more of her martial arts devastating more of the circling ravens and then vanishes.
	Zio disappears in one place and appears in another performing more arcane incantations and movements and fires a blast of heat at the last of the frenzied ravens.
	Ochi reaches into his belt pouch and pulls out a handful of caltrops which he scatters across the floor in front of the crowded doorway.
	Wei yan continues spitting fire upon the enemies.
	Ukshaka still blinded remains in place unsure of what to do.
	One of the freshly singed ninja passes across the caltrops and leaps back favoring an injured foot.
	Koya touches Ochi with a want rejuvenating him.
	Another ninja attempts to pass through the caltrop filled portal also gaining a limp but continues on to strike at Ochi and misses.

	Another swings past Ochi.
	
	3.

	Zio sprays a contained blizzard from his hands at the foes and two more of the ninja slump.
	Ochi closes on the ninja too cautious to traverse the caltrops going the the door into one of the rooms off of the long hall. 
	
	Inside ten sleeping pallets lay neatly arranged about this room. At the foot of each is a small locker for personal belongings and an open iron trapdoor sits in the floor and near the east wall.\
	
	Inside Ochis blade meets with the flesh of his target and finishes it.
	Wei Yan joins Ochi in the room running along the wall to leap at the last remaining foe slashing as he does.
	Ukshaka continues to hold position blinded.
	Grayson finishes Wei Yans work with a few more arrows.
	The remaining human shadow sprints to the trap door and throws itself down and out of sight.
	
	4. 
	
	Noe gives chase and after a moment of confused sounds from below the rest of the caravaneers just hear 
	"Trolls!" Called louldy back up.
	
	The room below is a furnace room sweltering from the effort. The coals in the rooms name sake roar opposite the chute Noe just entered from. A heap of coal is stacked against the east wall and an iron door opens in the ceiling above the coal pit. Three crude beds made of poorly cured bear skins and wolf pelts have been thrown on the floor before the fire. A Hog's head, rests between them next to the bloody bones of someone unfortunate creature.
	
	The two Troll occupants look up from the boar they were enjoying at their two unexpected guests.
	
	Zio with a word and a flourish creates several copies of himself and enters the room past the caltrops.
	Ochi darts down the trap door after Noe arriving next to her and the fleeing ninja. Seeing that Noe is up to her shinobi tricks again and the ninja is stunned face down on the floor in the face of the trolls Ochi buries a sword in his back ending his life.
	
	It is at this point that the rooms occupants begin to react the faster of the two commenting.
	"Look what we got 'ere, Tasty li'il bird."
	And he strikes Ochi.
	Koya also arrives down the chute gracefully on her feet.
	"Oh... You're just right there."
	The other Troll steps up and also attemps to sink his claws into Ochi.
	Grayson hesitates to follow his companions and leave Ukshaka defenseless and alone watches her feel her way to a curtain and duck behind it and gives chase. Landing just as gracefully as Koya he looses an arrow before even fully coming to rest at the bottom of the chute finding the flesh of one of the disturbed diners.
	
	5. 
	
	Noe carves a piece off of one of the Trolls with a deft blade who promptly begins bleeding profusely.
	Zio joins the fray clambering down the chute himself and upon view the scene in the furnace room applies extra heat to the situation firing a cone of searing flames from his hands onto the trolls.
	Ochi zeroes in on the weakness of the more ailing of the two trolls that Noe had carved up and levies a few strikes at it very nearly felling it.
	Wei Yan makes his way to the fray clambering over Zio to fire his own cone of flames at the trolls.
	The visibly flagging troll falls with a boom to the floor after this onslaught.
	Koya puts a hand on Ochi's shoulder filling him with healing energies.
	The still standing furnace denizen lashes out at Ochi wildly missing on all counts.
	Grayson sends several more arrows into the flesh of the troll in response.
	Helgarval spews yet more fire from his mouth on both trolls
	
	6. 
	
	Noe steps up to the remaining troll drawing out her second blade and scores vicious blows sending him to the floor to join his roomate.
	Zio draws out his mace and brains the helpless foe ending the danger.

Ochi mutters a prayer under his breath for the life lost.

"You keep praying like that and the gods might actually listen" - N

Surveying the room they find a poorly hidden stash, presumably belonginging to the trolls, under a very thin layer of coals. Inside are gold armbands and a small sack of amethysts.

Now out of the clamor of combat they are able to look around and see another hallyway out of the other side of the furnace room Ochi leading the pack steps forward to get a closer look. It is a flooded passage. A deep channel of flowing water crosses. The hall here on the opposite side lies, a heavy timber plank a brass bell, and Clapper hanging from the wall on this side of the stream. 

"Scion of Amatatsu you have come to retrieve me from this place of darkness. You are close now. They have cast me into some sort of dark pit. Seek me out." - T
"Do they have a Ameiko? Have you seen her? Is she alive?!" - O
"I assume this is the Amatatsu you serve?" - T
"Yes!" - O
"I have not touched her mind in this place." - T
"They've captured her and I hope they're holding her here... We will need your help." - O

Seeing everyone else's looks as he has this mental dialouge Ochi turns to them.

"I hear... the voice of the sword... I think the sword is here and it's speaking to me." - O
"How hard did you get hit by the troll?" - N looking at Ochi quizically.

Ochi grabs her arm and pulls her closer to the underground stream. 

"Ah, There are multiple scions." - T
"Oh, okay. That's unnerving." - N
"It is good to see the rise of the Amatatsus once more" - T

Now closer and with the others stepping forward as well they party deliberates the way forward. North, South, or the door across the hall.

"The sword. I believe is this way. I think it would be very helpful." - O Nodding forwards.
"Certainly so long as we're not going to get jumped by any further surprises this time around" - N

She steps forward examining the door to the south carefuly for traps and finding none. The door is locked however but Noe expertly applies some mechanical trickery and the door clicks and cedes ingress.

"Now what do you have locked up." - N easing the door open.
The ceiling of this Grand Chamber rises 20 feet overhead. It's heavy beam serving as both Raftors and supports for the great hall above. Teak paneling covers the walls and the floors of polished wood. Along the walls wooden columns rise to the ceiling above bearing banners and emblazoned with pictograms from far off Tian Xia. Above these hang small oil lamps that give up a dim glow. A small, porcelain bowl rests before the center column to the south and four reed mats are arranged before it.

"I think we go this way." - O
"I suspect this might be their equivalent of a Dojo." - N

Ochi steps in to the room and after nothing unexpected happens his fellows follow him.
The caravaneers spread out across the dojo noting the numerous doors leading from the large main room.
Noe quietly edges one open to peek into the interior.
Inside she appraises and shirtless and loose pant clad muscled human meditating with his back turned. He does not notice Noe's presence. She edges into the room without a sound drawing one of her blades as she does. 

	1. 
	
	Noe attempts to eviscerate him but at the last second he gracefully leaps out of the way.]
	
	1. 
	
	Before he can fully recover Noe presses her advantage levying another swing at him which he again narrowly dodges but cannot manage it on the second blade. He slumps to the floor silently.

With the enemy neutralized Noe takes stock of the contents of the room and finds Inside are three beautiful jade raven statuettes, a short spear of master quality, and an amulet made of beast scales. Noe examines and then stows these items then emerges from wherever she had vanished to covered in a great deal of blood.

The others unaware of this creep up to various other doors. Grayson similarly to Noe quietly edges open another door. He is not as successful in supressing his presence from the occupant.

	1. 
	
	Before he can fully react to Grayson's Intrusion an arrow sprouts from his chest and he cries out alerting any other enemies who may be nearby. 
	
	1. 
	
	Zio who is still in the larger hall produces a wand from his belt readying himself for trouble at the cry.
	Grayson finishes the bleak work he started and snuffs out his target before he can do anymore.
	One of the doors bursts open and Zio, prepared for this, fires off several bolts of magical energy from his wand at the new enemy a similarly garbed human.
	Still standing after the magical barrage the dojo dweller returns a missile in kind in the form of a spear hurled just past Zio.
	Koya who was lingering near the door into the large room hurries forward to assist.
	Another human bursts forth from yet another door. Their eyes settle on Noe and they launch a spear just past her.

Noe having casually dodged that "What was sensei doing with you."

	Another student clamours out of their room adds to the spears on the floor of the room with another miss.
	
	2. 
	
	Noe closes quickly on one of the students forcing them to dodge her slashes.
	In return one of the students reinforces their peer and strikes Noe with a spinning kick.
	Ochi evens the odds for Noe bringing his blades to bear on the pair flanking Noe scoring a hit.
	Zio unleashes a boulder of snow and Ice impacting one of the trained fists.
	Koya whips her starknife across the room only to have it deflected in the same manner Omeyani had done previously. To the students surprise though the star knife flies back to Koyas hand.
	Grayson seeing the technique again takes advantage of their distraction to dispatch them with two arrows. His third is sent at another only to have them deflect it in the same fashion.
	The surrounded Noe continues to be beset with fists and feet taking another blow from her masters students.
	
	3. 
	
	She returns strikes in kind.
	Wei Yan and Helgarval do fire stuff but their foes are too quick.
	Ochi circles around to even the odds. Attempting to cut him off his quarry scores a stab with a spear across his shoulder. Ochi weathers it and levels his sword before swinging at one of the encirclers.

>"Why don't you try me instead." - O

	His blow while full of intent still misses.
	Zio narrowly misses clubbing another student with his mace.
	Koya closes the distance to Noe and with a touch uses Desna's Grace to mend some of her copious wounds.

Noe still spewing blood

>"I appreciate you trying."

	Grayson fires at the unarmed attacker next to Zio with such a strong draw and precision that their inevitable maneuver to deflect missiles does not stop the shaft.
	Ochi continues harrying Noe's Outflankers but can't connect.
	Noe's assailants continue pressing their advantage landing even more blows.
	
	5. 
	
	Noe deftly steps around her opponent to change the battlefield to her advantage pressing her attackers back but not connecting with any strikes.
	Ochi continues to not be able to cause any real damage to their enemies.
	Zio returns to his wand tactic pinpointing magical energies to fell one of the remaining students.
	Koya releases a burst of divine energy revivifying her companions.
	Grayson targets the last remaining enemy but he deflects and dodges all the deadly shots.
	Omeyani's last remaining student continues their assault on Noe landing yet more blows.
	Wei yan passes through his legs and attacks him.
	
	6. 
	
	Noe attempts to fight back but her opponent is much haler than her in her state and her swings fall short.
	Helgarval fills Ochi with angelic energies aiding him.
	Ochi steps to close the distance to the remaining foe and with Helgarvals assistance strikes him twice but he remains standing.
	Zio goes to use his wand again and the bolts of magic finally overcome the monk.

Ochi says a prayer for the dead.
Grayson collects the quality crafted spears that the students were bearing.

The room the battle left the Scions in contains a meditation screen of obviously Tian Ming style. Behind the screen is a small leather trunk. 
inside they find a washer woman's clothes and other possessions, including a disguise kit, an ornate decorative blowgun fashioned from Jade and lapis lazuli, gold pieces in Tian coins, and a writ signed by Sven Bloodeagle that gives the bearer the authority to commandeer any of the Linnorm Kings housecarls within two miles of Kalsgard for up to 12 hours.

> "Do what you want with this. Take it. Burn it. i don't care." - N



Can't think of our skin would would overshadow it. He doesn't always have that actually.
Well, that was the thrilling.
Let's be on our way.

I guess going down the other way that we originally going to go to. Yes, just to be thorough. Grayson is going to search the room. That was clearly umayani's for like a secret passage.

But you find anything of the sort in that room.

I have no a help me put the board across the thingy. You need, you get across the rushing waters with ease.
Assuming you don't mind balancing too much.
Water shame, that would be.
Do we hear anything in particular from either of these tools? I mean, we know you hear the sound of water coming from this direction. I think that. Yeah, we want to go this way because this is where we could tell the sword was. That is the door locked. Can I just try it or sorry?
Let's back up. Hold up. I want to see if it's trapped.
They want a second opinion. Oh, she says I don't think it's trapped and he tries the door. Oh,

likely for you. It's not trapped. 

opens into a natural cavern 30 feet across and 15 feet high. A waterfall. Pours in through a small aperture, high on the south wall, filling a turbulent pool in the floor and sending a cold spray throughout the room. A smooth ledge extends outward from the door and two large barrels have been set to the right of it. Another ledge sits on the far side of the pool, a smaller cask sits fullness ledge next to a heavy wooden door.
Just a bunch of barrels, casks. Over there.
Do I notice anything strange about the water? Nope, just looks like natural spring water and how high above the water. Are these ledges?
Not too far like maybe the few inches. Okay cool. I'm gonna swim across guys. I want to check this out. Oh no. I walks across. God damn it.
Wet. And you think that like Yep I can move down my speed as a full round action that can go over difficult terrain water been branches. What problem you? It's just cold. It doesn't look like anything. It's in the barrels at the front of the room but the cask next to the other door is sealed and holds an unfamiliar and potent alcohol.
Oh that's not unfamiliar, it's sake from Minkai. Oh, hell yeah, it is a door. Look trap. That's for Gillum sits. Atop the tap, the cask.
Motivated as per gallon.
Yeah, weapon. It is it usually holds. Holy water are. Yeah, no way. Can you take a look at this door? Oh, you want my opinion now? Yeah, sure. White's like takes up, glasses wipes, like a layer of the blood. That was spilling from our forehead and has a look at it.
And it's not trapped. It is most definitely blocks though, and the 29 on that. I was literally just looking at the block.

Pops open.
This room is small and musty Hewn from solid rock near the far wall, stands a low. Well it's opening only a foot in diameter a winch and chain with a rusted steel bucket. Hang from the wall above it. The far corners. It's a pile of old wooden buckets and other debris, rotten broken with several different kinds of fungi growing on their remnant.
How toxic are those and how quickly am I going to die from breathing? This thorosin, not that kind of fungus and disappointed. One importantly, looks down this. Well, tries to the squins a bits. It gets very bright further down the well as a katana wedge into this tiny asshole of lights with gold and red flames.
Oh cheese. White and gold. Yeah way.
This is actually important.
It's kind of like orangey gold flames. Hmm, How did you say this was about like a foot diameter. Oh, but yeah. Well, that would be incredibly problematic if right. There you are. 

I'm retrieving and a will come around one of those down a. Well honestly, who's my goodness. Apparently Google.
Let's complain and more going to fucking gets the book. He claims easily done the well.
Inside up for this. So, very slowly because
This is actually really heavy for him.
Yeah, his push drag is 50 pounds. How broken light heavy? It's like regular katana. Heavy six pounds. So it's it's almost at his lift above head weight and he's kind of got a lift above head. Push not drag. Okay? Okay. I'm hearing a lot of complaints and what I'm actually needing to hear is how far down is it?

Because if you can't pull it, we have this wonderful Fandangled invention, year called rule, I'm getting it. Oh well, why didn't you just send a rope down? Because it was funny funnier to see you get after it. I asked question, even the one who went into this. He me the room time.

We throw it all down to him. Okay, goes through a bag. Pulls up. And last year, is the end of it and hand it. Filing up complaints. With the heavenly Bureau fear. I well, the heavenly bureaucracy can talk in ways until we've gotten back our sail and I would tug on the rope after a minute.

That. And yeah you guys pull out blah ocean endlessly. Excuse me, it's changed. Where did you go? There you are. If we were home.

So this beautiful blade made an ancient Tian style, has both a scabbard and that's so basic looking. I think that makes sense. I it is almost beautiful and its simplicity. It's scabbard is black and glossy and still in perfect condition. And the wrapped handle appears to be made of some form of leather. That you're not familiar with and the gold. Accoutrement are shining sill. Fancy that's rings. A cloth out. Whips off. Whatever dust and gumkit managed to get on old adapter. Archie, you're free my friend and he grabbed out of the vomitasu. Very have my thanks for the rest. It is good. Now, that this plan has finally come to fruition, as I foresaw, They did not foresee the only stealing me before your it's concerned. They've been very hard at work with a concern, you to learn that. They also have our Scions somewhere around here. It does greatly it. That's the like, literally just drops the sword unless he capture that. And then just what I stand is. Like I said, I grab a gingerly. Well, no no. I said I grabbed it, I grab it and tuck it into like the back of my belt, my little OB. you can come with me. S

o here's fun thing. Solution is a plus two defending flaming katana. The endcircle blade of the Amitatsu family and switching can be wielded by any amatatou scion. You don't just have to be a natural ward dependent. You will allow someone who acts in defense of the throne to wield it as well. You hear that? Grayson. That could be fun. Flurry of katana, Although solution is neutral. Good, any amatatou style. Regardless of the Lightning can Falconing and negative level. This boon is at their discretion. However, and should such a Scion ever betrayed the family or prove. Unworthy. The sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict and because this is an artifact lightly take over your body.

So this might be a little bit of a fine detail. Does does Zeo know anything about what we're talking about with scions and such because he wasn't there. When the the seal was opened and we were made into Scions, he does not We've just been and the seal has not been opened again. 

He's kind of like thinking what's what the hell they talking about. He also can't hear the sword. So, that whole conversation, you guys just was just us talking to a sword while he stands behind us, Though. He might think you're all crazy.

I think is a little late for thinking whether or not we are crazy. And potentially just receiving confirmation at this point.


Which won't be honest. I'm going this way. Think somewhere here, just organic sled me.

You didn't realize yeah, the answer is now though.
Let's drop is a lot. Is it anything? It is that and now it's scroll back all the way up there.

Do you want? Just love how OG? Just kidding me. 

Moving forward. Yep. Boom. The stairs to send into a plain room of mortared. Stone walls, drip, with convincation giving the air a cold claimy feel, but you were supposed to be coming down the stairs over here.

Looks head back up, shall we?

Is the laboratory This room has been hewn from the rock of the Crag and a wooden stare rises along the walls, able some workbenches filled with chamber, holding all matter of Olymp Olympic Crucibels, burners, and assorted tools, as well, as a large glass case, holding one appears via humanoid body. A variety of dried herbs and plants dingle and perfusion from hooks in the bottom of bears and sex and chests. Hold additional equipment and components and have been shoved underneath the stairs. A torch mounted on one of the stairs stair pose illuminates. The chamber with a flickering glow, 

is this where they made you no way.
She gives you a look as, if to contradict you and then goes.

perception check.
The body is wriggling. Not like the body is still alive. Like there's something in the body. Like, lots and lots of small things and they are eating it.

It doesn't actually say how it opens though, I'm assuming. One of the yeah, the top or bottom. Probably comes off, cool. Oh, she's gonna take out a rope. No, it doesn't. And then he's gonna tie the lid closed.

---

Of the limbics crucibels, burners and assorted tools, as well as a large glass case holding what appears to be a humanoid body. A variety of dried herbs and plants tangle, and perfusion from hooks on the bottoms of the stairs and sax, and chest holding additional equipment components, have been shoved underneath the stairs, a torch mounted on one of the stairs post illuminates, the chamber with a flickering glow,

knowledge check

So terrifying only, let's not talk to them. Only infernal, though, I mind when hell wasps swarms together. They gain an intelligence of six and the ability to use skills and feats and can speak infernal with a voice made up of an amalgamation of their constant. Droning, I have more of a big curiosity to hear what that sounds like.

That would be super cool. I mean, I definitely don't have the vocal structure required to reproduce that, no, I get that. I'm just like, that's you know, what I mean? That's, that's really cool.
And so inside that knowledge check, do we know they're alignment as being like hecka, evil, definitely evil. Okay. They are bourbon from hell literally.
And so their prerogative is to like, go around and do more, horrible wasp stuff to people and make more wasps, they're gonna crawl inside your body, eat out all of your insights and then lay more hellwah, figs than you.
Not necessarily in that order. These are extreme. That's fun. Evil creatures. I say we open it and take them out at Ochi's. Gonna just put a hand on your shoulder. I don't, I don't think that's a very good idea. Grayson. I say we leave these where they are and just gonna concurrent poppy and paste their defensive line or you guys.
Swarms are serious business. Kind of insane. Yep. And this worm has improved initiative and toughness and the stealth of plus 24. That is insane. There's a reason they said to make sure that the players don't open this tube. You think were killing you. Wow. Okay, 

05:42

Yeah, I will say that seems like a pretty damn good deal. Yeah, It's pretty heavy amount of stuff. But that's what we brought way in, for he can totally carry that.
The monkey kind of just looks at you. Affronted A ringer counter spells, an empty ring of counter spells.
And we came up from here. So, we haven't actually come across this staircase yet here, which I'm good leads up.

You would be correct in this. Okay, let's can we unpause? So we can move around. I was going to. Yep. So sorry, visually see the staircase and just confirm that it goes up. In case we need to retreat to familiar territory. I can't collides with the wall.

Do we work? Are we going to try to take all the equipment and components? Just because it weighs so much since we don't have a bag of holding that that we have to put stuff in.

One bag of holding yet? No, no, he has one but she hasn't really shared it with the group. Yeah, we need to get our hands on one So perhaps we can just grab it on our way out. Instead of lugging it all around currently, I'm gonna call out, this doesn't look super familiar up here.

I think this goes somewhere else, I thought it went back to the main floor. I mean most I have a handy habitat but that's a handy hackersack.

OG's, gonna take some more steps forward.
The OG has ended up the stairs.
Yeah, this all doesn't look familiar. The shoot must have been longer than we thought.

There's a room over here. The Stonewalls turned to heavy timbers. As this tower climbs above the long haul, This landing is dark limited. Only by what little light spills from the room below a steep narrow stare lacking any railing rises through it. Opening in the ceiling. 20 feet above be honest.

Anyway, beyond the stairs, a door side room. Which is that door there? I'm gonna check and see if it's trapped question. Mark very well.
Just a cursory. Look at it before. We touch it.

Those sort of trappings about it. Nope, no. Trappings OT's. Gonna try the door handle to see if it's locked. It is also not lost. Okay, everybody with me. I'm gonna swing this bad boy open. Perhaps stealthily. 
I will attempt to follow stealthily. Oh, hell yeah, dude.

You see this wear bear sitting at a desk with a bottle of wine, this chamber, actually, reaps of stale wine, ring, sweat and wild animals for a rough bed. Sits at the far end in a pot belly stove, rests between the windows next to a cold bucket cross on the stove is a small table holding several empty wine skins and a small oaken statue wet where the werebear Jordan. The ax is currently sitting. 

Ochi closes the door and he's gonna turn to everyone in a really hush voice and say, the wear bears on the other side of the store. I don't necessarily want to cause any harm to him. He's being controlled. This none of the things that he's doing or to his normal attitude or will. I think we should maybe leave him be for the time being. There's no other rooms in there where I think a mako could be. It's just his bedroom.
No one has raised an alarm yet and he is perfectly content to drown his sorrows and wine for the moment. I think I'm really leaving him to his pain. I'm surprised that huge fight at the entrance wasn't having the alarm raised, 

So let's head back. Perhaps up the stairs further or down the stairs because we came from these stairs here. There were other doors down here. Yeah, down on the other level but I was trying to get back up to the main level. So we know how to get back. You should check the other doors down there. Oh gee. Here's the voice of God and they go back downstairs.

no way has just been sitting in here staring at the wasps making faces of them. I can't move stuck in a loop. I got you.

Well to get back down right now but I mean previously yeah to get here from the lower level, where the sword was we came up from those stairs and just now, we went Also up those stairs and checked all that stuff out. And then came back down the same stairs.
I'm just trying to orient myself. You are correct. Okay.

Oh, she's gonna step up to this one and just track. Try the handles. See if it's locked. It is not. So he cracks it open and then slowly opens it. And what do we see? 

This cramped, corridor runs from one side of the long haul to the other multiple doors open. At either end in all manner of boxes bags, chests and crates have been stacked against the walls. The Raptors hold hooks and nets from which hang additional supplies, a staff room, All the various tools equipment and non-perishable supplies necessary for the maintenance and up Ravens, cracker stored in this hallway, Nearly any sort of mundane tool can be found here, including a portable forage, and a set of masterworks Smith's tools. Yo Hmm. One in everyone is a room of stuff.

Grayson's gonna go to this other door down here, and it's gonna try opening it really. It's just little. Listen at it first. Emiru 30 there. It sounds like there's someone in there. 
Ochi gonna. That sounds humanoid. I. Yeah, I mean, it sounds like a human breathing and  Grayson turns to Ochi and just kind of given odd until Oh she's gonna draw his weapons. Eric Cousin all all open the door. Not stalkfully. That door is locked, Right? He points at no way and like Beckens her towards the door.

I am no way. Pushes glasses up nose immediately picks the lock immediately picks the lock and then steps to the side. I'll go through first Ochi will do exactly what Grayson would have done and just open the door. Oh cool. There's a guy, there is a guy who is clearly emaciated and malnourished. Kind of pushed up against the back wall. As the light pours into his one stark room, he closes his eyes and pain of No, no. My name is loot,

guys. There's sick loot in here who are recent shoots an arrow at Ochi's. The back of his neck. I was looking at loose one. That did it. Oh, she's looking at looking at Lou. What does he look like? Is he like doing recognize like the color is he's wearing or it looks like he was once dressed and buying merchants guard. But the months that he spent in this room subsisting on the very meager food that they give him and likely whatever rats, he was able to catch has left him very weak from malnutrition and fever Though. He doesn't seem to have any major injuries on him.

Oh, she's gonna put his swords away. And take a knee in front of this guy and tell him, 
We mean you no harm. We're here looking for some of our friends. We're we're not here to hurt you. In any way? What is your name? I'm Ochi. Ochi Suite,
loot hackers sly. 
Hello Lou. Nice to meet you. 
Don't? I wish you don't work for silver score. 
No, I wish we were meeting under better circumstances. We are very much at odds with the deceptive. Silver score. Do you know? Silver scores? True nature.
Yes, she seems to be some sort of strange. Purplish. Red ogre. 
She is an only in a demon in that odds, with my liege, who they've captured, have you heard or seen them bring anyone in since you've been here? How long have you been here? 
I don't know. I lost count of the days. I was a member of the Reim Runner, Guild Board of shareholders. I voted against a measure that she proposed and I was taken in the night and brought here. 
Well, we can really have for you. You seem to be of good nature and upstanding nature. We're happy to help you get out of here. We just need to find our friends. First We are looking for the guide off Gormander as well as bookshaka the apprentice and our our dear friend Amico. 

Grayson sense motive, this guy. And what he has said, so far you are more than welcome to. He is completely and utterly telling the truth. 

Are you well enough to travel?
I will travel to get away from this terrible place. There's, There's another one like her. We don't is green with big tusks. He was the one that questioned me the most. 
It wasn't silver score. But another only you think like silverscore. 
He was green though, not like her. 
Hmm, that's very good to know. Thank you for sharing. Have you seen any other special dangers folk like that around.
We've seen many of the frozen shadows themselves. But no, no leaders. Like Kim and Dotsu so far silver score.
So even her name is false, 
you'd be correct.
I heard someone being dragged in a couple of days ago, She was putting up quite the fight. 
That's good to know that she was still alive when she was brought here. Like we said, we're more than happy to help you escape this place but we do have business to attend to first.
If you're well enough that you think you can go down, you're we won't stop you but it might be best to wait until we've maybe dealt with some more of and enforces that dwell here.
I am in no condition to make the truck all the way back to Kel's garden. If there's a place I may wait for you nearby. 
Yeah we could we this is room nearby or another companion of ours is waiting. You could join her there. 
Yes, we could put you with oakshaka and you could help watch over each other. I know Shaka and gold Goremenders names. They are good. People just very acceptable. 
Yes, she was blinded and we did not want to endanger her more. So, perhaps you can watch over each other. 
If anyone comes, I will tell her where to swing. 
That would be perfect.
So and he'll reach out a hand for him and kind of if he wants to put his arm over your shoulder and help him walk and then escort him over to where Okshaka is hanging out. 
We have a spare blade for this. Fine gentleman.
I got a dagger. I can give him.
I'm sure. I I may look a proud alphan but I have little skill in arms.
God, used the wrong answer. Like some protection still better than nothing though. 
At this point, I will fight to live. If you can spare weapon, I will take it. 
That is good. You like to hear that?
Why don't you tell us more about what what they've kept you here for? He said they've been asking you questions. What kind of questions? 
I don't know, really and I don't understand the goatee. The one that keeps questioning me. I don't know what he's after.
Can you give us an example of a question that he asked you?
He was the one that handled my food and he would ask me how I felt after I ate it. 
Oh,
show goes going to cast. Detect magic. There's there's nothing going on with them.
Koya Korea. I'll get poison, there's nothing currently afflicting him, but there's a bit of a lingering trace of poison like someone was testing poisons on him. Mmm.
Not an enviable position to be in. Let's get you off to Ushaka. You should be safer there. 

So we'll throw him over my shoulder a little bit and walk him towards the door. We were out before thinking.

Okay, wine and food stores. This room is dark and cold and numerous barrels, baskets and sacks are stacked about the room butchered carcasses primarily sheep, but a few hogs as well, along with bundles of roots, tubers and herbs. Hang from the wooden rappers overhead. And in one corner sits a clay pot filled with what looks like fresh honeycomb.

The food stuff room and keep in mind. I've got the tech magic up for six minutes. So tell me if that means anything it does not. It's mundane food stuffs in here
this room is Bart from the side. All you have to do is lift the bar up and it unlocks the door.

Ochi will ask Grayson or showco to come over and grab the other side of a bar? Because he's only got one arm right now. Kristen why He's helping the old man walk. Okay, we'll pop those bad boys off.

Stay. Well, friends we will come back When we have Mako in hand.

Is that the bird that I smell? 
Yes, we found one of the previous board members of the Rheim Runner's Guild that they took who defied Kim and Dotsu. He's very ill. We brought him here to help. Watch your back and keep both of you safe.

Come friends. You will be my eyes and I will make you a pulses to help with your Everything situation. 
yes. I also have some jerky here. Oh, hell yeah. 
Oh geez. Like kind of get something. We think them have been testing poisons on him, So these probably still got a bit of that, in this system.

OT now realizes, there's a door in this room that I don't know that we've been through before. You have not. He's gonna just try that handle real quick. It opens just fine. Let's see. Full moon. This is eight little boom. 

So after actually searching this room now, you do find all of this.
That's cool. A bunch of swag, a bunch of swag.

All right, watch over each other. We must continue on Be safe.

What do you guys think? Which way should we go? I guess back to all the humor they were like to the doors that we haven't been to.
Oh, we at night. There's one other don't we haven't meant to yet?
He'll check the door for traps.
It may perception. Check. What is this See? Denote. Does that denote anything that we can see in the feeling? There's a trapdoor. Oh, what is the ceiling? I'm pretty sure it's the ceiling. Yes, a trapdoor in the ceiling. That is not hidden. Oh, there's a door to the south here, too.

I didn't even see that if you don't find any traps and you hear the distinct sound of looking.
The real sex back.
He says I hate cooking. I hate clicking sounds. I don't know what it is, but it's looking. I'm gonna try the handles here. If it's locked. It's not locked. Stealthily crack the door open.

Wow. Okay, So you said four frozen shadow ninjas just going about their day cooking.

Stones. Roofed with steeply. Sloping thatch has been constructed against the walls of the main hall and adjacent cliff base. You massive ovens occupy, the south wall and a number of tables, and trestles have been set up about the room for food preparation.

OG's gonna leave the door, just slightly a jar so you can see through it and not touch it and turn around and just tell everybody. There's, there's several more than ninjas in here.
OG is then gonna kick the door open and charge in.

Theo, you're surprise around mover standard. It can be standard.
I'm gonna have, I'm gonna have to five foot step. Sadly. Now, I can cast it for more I'm at, and I don't have to worry about hitting a Ochi.
Hey, how would you? Now I need the ninjas. All three of many way. No, all four of them.
No, that does miss this one. Oh and why is it show it on the on the thing because where you originally dropped it? It hit all of them. Okay, All right. So as you can also take free actions during the surprise round.

And choco.

I start  performance Yeah, that's my turn. 
All right, that is good. Do nothing. Okay. Then Consuming arrow and sure. Yep, racing test arrow.
kills the first ninja. 
Ochi. Oh, gee is going to zoom up in between all of them and pull out his weapons.

Way young, I put steps.
On that close enough.
And boom. Yeah, no I said not close enough.

zio You will probably walk forward playing out his mace, I proceed to beat it with a beat the ninja in front of them.

hoka will just take out his sword and Run on in. lose the door behind him. I'll switch back to YouTube and take a swing at this guy. That here and staggers him

ninja Nice to attack you with butcher knife. He's holding.
And misses that does not hit. And he takes one damage because he was staggered. Yeah. Oh yeah. He drops.

noe
Oh, great thing. You not doing anything. He moved 10 foot and then opened a door. It's door got slammed in his face. He was gonna be like, oh, there's another door over here. I'll go open it. Who close the door behind them, you know? Okay. Yeah, well if that's the case then.

Oh, she's gonna do that.
And I will roll to avoid if I need to, you will need to. But remember the Acrobatic thing cuts your movement in half. That's true. So what am I at right now? Actually, maybe 25. I think yeah, it's a you were here. So Yeah, I wouldn't be able to do that.

58:16

Basically, You could get right up to him. That defeats the purpose of what I want to do. I'll just take the attack of opportunity. butcher knives. Yeah, he hit So I'll take that and then in retaliation, I'm going to balk him. I'm gonna do a bonk.
I forgot to target him. It's okay, open.
Anything else on your turn? I think that's it.
The door slowly creeks open with a monkey hanging from the handle.

I'm sorry. 
call. You was trying to target herself. She hates stabbing people in the back, but these are bad people. 

Grayson's gonna go search, the room that he's in, because even though we killed the people in it earlier, we didn't actually search it. I don't think no, you did not see seven.

It doesn't bunk sand haphazardously about this room soon with rumpled bedding assorted clothing and personal items. And the discarded remains of food and empty plates. You have the north door. Sit, two stain foul smelling buckets that are apparently not empty frequently enough.


The hidden Dell, a pitched purest. Delle squeezes between the steeply sloping flanks of the nearby crabs that rise a hundred feet or more of overhead narrow waterfall rushes. The notorian down one of these slopes and collects and they catch pawn next to a batch roof lean-to with two large fieldstone chimneys, which is the kitchen a small torrent exist in this pond wending. Its way towards the Great Hall where it disappears into a metal great in the halls foundation apart from the lean to leads over a narrow. Bridge of rough sawn logs, arching over the stream and further down the defile until it is lost among the rocky outcroppings beyond Interdasking.

I like to thank you luck. Noah, and a room full of various little chemical stuff. And she's basically just being helping herself for the last few minutes while you guys were murdering stuff in the background. 

Numerous wooden bed frames. Look real mattresses occupy. This sparsely furnished room. It does not appear that. Anyone has used this room recently, but it could quarter as many as a dozen.

And he's gonna go up here and check the closet because we found a bunch of stuff in the other one. Nope, this room is empty. Dang. All right, folks, 

Do we want to go back to where we found? Are board member friend, and try and go back up those stairs up, the tower. Or should we try and go down the stairs off of the long haul. 
Let's go up to the second story of the long haul, okay? 
But I said what that what we said. 
Let's do it. 
I mean I think I like going up if I was a ninja overlord that's where I'd be.

What other Natalie? What. Yeah, what's the point of having a big castle? If you don't really enjoy the view to make people think that you would be in the big funny tower when you'd actually stick a wizard in there.

Well, Let's flip that coin.

So we check these oh yeah. Upper closets. Here's the trapdoor, by the way.

Oh, she's gonna try the handle on this one. It is locked.

And one of the other side. So over here is the height table and these are a bunch of other eating tables.

This is the trapdoor that leads directly to the hall beneath.

No. Wait, you just did you go past the high table over here?

Yeah, you would probably assume this as much because chart, but let's see some scald words, roughly carved into the table. With dagger point 

Time is the coin of fools rendered due onto the gods.

Beams carved in stable, where snoring stone? I would have said. Hmm. Oh cool. We've got mad Rambling in here, too. Fantastic. What was that again?

Was words Grayson since no ways on the other side.
You're pretty good at these sorts of lock things, right? Could you take a look at this? 

Before we do anything  shook us, gonna recast like magic because he's got a funny feeling. Do I get anything? Nope. No magic. Mmm. Well, the way because we can just talk across the hall. Is that one locked on the other side?

the cloakroom. This room holds cloaks and cold weather clothing to outfit the occupants of the hall through the long winters in addition valuable furs and males of raw wood appeared from the old super super here. 
Unique rifle through pockets, nobody happens to have anything in the might suggest wearing us, except things, you know, things being people that are vaguely important. 
perception. Check for those. Searching the room
over a 17 you discover several roles of leather covered in tiny cramps scalded runes stuffed into one chest appear to be the personal diaries of snoring, stone, eye and relates. Not only his vile past but also details of his apocalyptic revelation.

01:15:28

Apocalyptic. You say, Indeed Anyone that can read scald make me a linguistics check?

You find in the rantings. Something we're referring to a concealed cash in the upstairs, flu. I didn't away for the coming winter. Also, in that room is all displayed old snorty. Had a little holiday stash. I thought that sunk with him. Sudden apparently he did very well first until we go and find that stash doing a murder and stuff. There's a reason he was called the Mad River. Where would that flu be? i think you're kind of just hand waving that. But where would that at the end of the haul? It says in the upstairs flu. I don't even know what a flu is. It's a fireplace thing.

If someone could move me would be greatly appreciated. I can't quite be my computer right now, you

Say the stores locked. Good. It is 29. It's open 

wooden pegs on the walls of this chamber holds shields and scabbards wooden sands. Hold chainmail, hobler, Hallbergs and open chest sold arrows, and axes, a number of spheres have also been stacked together in one corner. This room is Raven crabs Armory and there is magic in here.

Oh, there is a single magical arrow in the 225 arrows. In the chest. Oh, Starcraft Fold story, really didn't spare any expense? 

Yes, smell crap. Please.

And the bum. Do they single greater magical beast? Slang arrow. No. I spend that around and hand it over to Greyson.

Well, I think we found everything. We're going to find up here. 

Oops. It never unlocked the door for you. It's all right. So long as a giant, spider thing doesn't creep out of it and try and eat me. Oh, that's absolutely going to happen. This is farm waiting for it.

But she just hear himself. Yeah, I'm just hoping the princess and decided to get herself into a bit of bother. I'll just be always there. A staggered low bat on the map.

And because I felt like it. Okay above. I didn't know, like it.

Oh we'll see too much fat. Would you preferred less fat as opposed to know that Just regular bat would have been acceptable? The boom and then with a screeching screaming sound. Oh, it's here. Several raven swarms drop from the openings in the ceiling.

initiative. Whatever. I don't want to fight the giant rear and swarms but they have eyeballs for you.

No. Okay. I guess I'm going to ready ready in action when they get caught within range then like I guess,

Here. I forget one of that more than that range. I will cast a spell. It'll be a furious small. Stumbles, okay. Hello.

Well, that sucks for that swarm. What's that? They drop into the bonfires directly beneath them. They also take fall damage.

36, but let me

How far they drop it was. That question. 40 feet. That's that's pretty. So they're open the ceiling right now. They drop. Yeah, with 43 to get to water our level is and then they're got an additional however many people to drop further.

No, they're still 40 feet from the ground. Okay. Hopeless is not it's called I mean it's still pretty tall. 40 feet like and then conference and they are catching on fire.

All right. How does following damage work with us? Componentate each tape. Stop thinking about them. As individual creatures, I know It was a creature.

That's hatching on fire. Okay, we will just go with besides, for boiling water damage. I guess they have that but not a bonfires more often immerse. There's something that I bought for playing damage. He exposure.

Don't actually see a bonfire on here anywhere though.

I mean author, just separate rules for catching on fire. There are. But then they'd only take one new 6 points of damage being immersed in the boiling. Water. Does Henry stick points damage for a round of exposure? And I mean, bonfires get really fucking hot. They seem like basically at least be comfortable to that set up 1v6.

01:28:42

Yeah, you want you can you can also anywhere you want. The reason why they only do one V6 is because abstractly speaking, you can like survive running through it on my You can but dropping directly into it for an entire roundness. It's different.

01:29:04

I don't disagree. So I'm gonna roll it as full immersion, just like boiling water since they're literally dropping directly onto it. Yeah. I feel It would be really silly if like straying someone up and like setting them on fire like a witch. Only did 1D specs damage time. Ridiculous.

01:29:36

Of.

01:29:42

That's warm is gone. But now I'm just saying that I have made this house, really. It applies to players too. But don't fall into a bonfire unconscious.

01:30:00

Favorite sports.

01:30:11

They have to double move, but they're coming. No, she did.

01:30:26

What?

01:30:35

Yeah, I think that's just you and choir right now Shoko. Yeah, and then their irate.

01:30:50

Lose what you see important in reflex. Save.

01:31:05

Oh yeah.

01:31:20

All right. Play will technically be blind for one day.

01:31:31

Bones just over here.

01:31:44

Wow.

01:31:55

Making it. Okay. Turn now,

01:32:05

Oh, gee says, brothers brothers. There's no need for this. Just kidding. They're too far away from me to really do anything. I will run all the way up into do some stab on this other one. Perhaps.

01:32:24

You may be needed. Am I interesting? Organ called away with baby? No, I see him doing stuff.

01:32:47

You can charge into this square if you want.

01:32:56

He went way in, as little,

01:33:08

Here. Now anywhere. Yeah, just discord things With a charge. I can move double speed and attack still, that is correct. Oh then I'll take a swing and they are tiny. So that if you have damage from attacks but you can attack them, I remember they're fun.

01:33:35

That hits.

01:33:39

All right, that's all I got you.

01:33:53

Theocast. That's good.

01:34:06

Here.

01:34:25

They fail and a bunch of frozen birds fall from the sky.

01:34:42

I'm sorry. Anything else nature? No. That I over the main concern. It's better already action, you know?

01:34:59

Find your bread.

01:35:06

Babies Ravens. Cannot make reflex saves save their lives.

01:35:12

Now, I did you get the healing from that channel. That was a channel. Yeah, clear. Just channeled. Oh so she did. Thank you. Apologies. Cool. But we're gonna roundhouse throw hands.

01:35:40

Not should be the first attack.

01:35:56

Pull down, because it was bloomberg that on. This is.

01:36:02

Right, they're funny.

01:36:13

And see that. These are just one. Of course, that's just that's just rude supposed to action key point. I ate her ones people. Wow, I'll just take these. Let's go to make up for all the creating we did on Thursday it really is no I would be doing all the credit on Thursday.

01:36:34

You knows very out of character. Great incredibly. So actually make all the one occasionally feed actually like massive, but yeah, no, that's that's my entire time. I will definitely.

01:36:53

And controvert.

01:37:21

Protection, heat can go over here.

01:37:27

Backgrounds.

01:37:32

And no directions where he doesn't hit someone actually.

01:38:04

That's his turn. Grayson.

01:38:11

Here's a little, pull out some blunt arrows, and we'll shoot at the swarm.

01:38:25

You. That's okay. You only need to done first one.

01:38:35

See, you don't need to be scared of all swarms. You guys can handle the ratings forms, just fine.

01:38:47

Press X to down.

01:38:54

I'm suppose anyone's all red-bellied one among these.

01:39:02

You know, production, but no because he didn't. No, I didn't say anything.

01:39:19

Oh, close the cases. Now going to be smelling up, roasted bird for at least the next little while, but still no closer to finding what we're actually here for, I take it. Oh, and a frozenberg Township. Oh, I'm dessert. Wonderful.

01:39:40

Raven obstacles.

01:39:47

In front of where

01:39:57

So you guys have searched the entirely now of the first floor and second floor of the long novel. So the only places left are open to that tower or back down to the dungeon.

01:40:20

I think we're not towards the power for me to find that.

01:40:32

And if I don't know, here might as well Since we don't know whether she is up or down, triple up.

01:41:00

The up and down stairs on this weren't working in a minute ago. Ah crap. And so we're heading for the tower, right? I'm just gonna gather everyone up. Yeah, they are. Instead of making a wonder through, which while amusing is also time to consuming.

01:41:30

You're gonna take all the amusement you can get it. I really do, There are some days where I want to just shake players and like let me have fun too. Real loud Tap. The front, the power This way, is the direction that does not

01:42:03

Oh great. That's lovely.

01:42:09

Let me get to move all of us back onto this. Oh, you did. Thank you. I don't know why that particular teleporter shoots everyone right into that wall. I appear to accept the time space continuum, there was one important thing that I left out before you got back here.

01:42:29

Abby, How did you get there? You don't have this latest clue but I decided to take a peek into the cliffside.

01:42:47

So something I missed you said.

01:42:53

Yeah, when you get up here, I could show you. If you move to where like, Koya is on the stairs, Oh, what is that? A local day. This room off behind the staircase, is Jordan, the axis bedroom, where we left him alone to drink in his sorrows because he's level good and being forced to do.

01:43:15

Bad boy, bad bear things until we passed on finding

01:43:26

And we're sure that he's being forced. That was about to say, no I just kind of like shakes her head in his late is under a black heels. Is Though I didn't put it on the artwork because it's not my original artwork and I totally forgot. He does have a big red, bloody mark on his chest.

01:43:49

So we're going up these stairs. It's another people have blood gears as usually because they willfully got them.

01:44:00

How do you remove one of those? By the way that something we could remove from it. Well, then my case apparently you put it yourself into contact with an incredibly powerful artifact and it blats it off. But I get the suspicion that wouldn't work for him and more importantly you certain that he's so goodly intended.

01:44:27

I'm sure he's my backup character.

01:44:33

That's a joke.

01:44:40

All right, you Didian, we did say, he said wear bears are laval good. I don't know if that's always or most of the time or a lot. Oh, but no, that's that's just they are traditionally and inclined to be. That means absolutely nothing for As a mouse can be evil.

01:45:01

It's true. Well, he seems sad so I didn't want to hurt him. He did, he was drowning in wine. It looked like I just sounds like something man, if you want to fight it you can go fight him. I'll stand right here and watch.

01:45:24

She now that you've laid some eggs and had them hatch, you've become very soft on us. I think you and I both know, I've been very soft the entire time. Yep, you're right. Oh excellent. Remember that one time? I spared some goblins. Oh boy, what just happened? He's just, Why would you do that?

01:45:48

That was what I say. All right, your backseat drivers. Get up here and die with me.

01:45:58

Above. There's about to be a lot of bird on bird violence right here. There's a super bird on bird violence going. Okay, I'm sorry. No, you you don't need to worry. They were waiting for someone to step up on the stairs before. This is against flat-footed as they popped out of invisibility, dang.

01:46:27

We've been thinking sneak attack. Hold on one second.

01:46:40

I don't think I have it yet. If you're looking for uncanny, you don't have it. Yeah, well I can take it from the flourishes for warrior poet too and I don't look, it doesn't look like I have. So yeah, that gets me. Yeah, you. Yeah. And it's back which is sick.

01:46:58

It is quick. So I took a stab and I took another stab, what you got too fast, but they're not get sneak attacks off on me. Oh, they do. Oh boy, I set up sneak attacks separately.

01:47:17

OG just goes of 23 points of damage outs.

01:47:29

And then the next encounter will be good.

01:47:38

Oh boy.

01:47:45

Okay, koias right here.

01:47:57

They won't hit me again. That's for sure. Hear the question isn't quite kind of you know plane. All right. That's actually a good point. Probably not actually because having read read the iRake it can be gotten rid of with these E15 heel check. Which you probably have done Shaka?

01:48:26

Yeah, Yeah. Probably Though, we'll say she did and Chaka is still guarding. That merchants Also the stairs, you

01:48:45

And we're going to take a quick 10. People to grab drinks and use the restroom KK. Oh,

02:00:27

And, And since the stage of quitting smoking where I'm hacking stuff up. Oh, school. Dear. No, it's it's a good stage. Just an awful stage of the same time.

02:00:48

We're not even. If everyone here.

02:00:58

Sound off.

02:01:03

Do we have magnets because these look like he's moved. Yeah, yeah. I was called away partway for what we were doing earlier. And so yeah, I got sprinkled down here. Where are we? I will put you up here.

02:01:24

They are up these stairs in the tower.

02:01:30

If you would join us in initiative, please?

02:02:10

Pleasurable. Hey Theo.

02:02:20

I can't move. Look inside. It's imposed, though.

02:02:29

And come over there.

02:02:33

Artist that guy. But this.

02:02:43

That breaks through his blur effect.

02:02:49

And that's the end of my turn. Oh, it's turning in. I guess he will pull it back. He will want. Now, he will pull attack.

02:03:14

It's too.

02:03:21

Yeah, they go, they one of those fitsy. Right first. Oh, well, no. Yeah, he hits me away. He want the 20, net 20. What would hit the internet 20? Yeah, it wasn't that 20. Oh, it isn't that 20, but it wouldn't confirm. Talk about the Tango's attackers Zeo's attack.

02:03:46

This is the tank attack. Is it walk is Ashi attack will hit his bite. Attack will hit the crit, will not hit. Okay. And then here to snack attacks, I'm sorry, is the flanking included in the bite? Actually the confirmation because then he would the 16 hits. You got my flat-footed, I still have an acted.

02:04:14

Oh shit.

02:04:18

Well, at least the critical damage is only three points more. You got your backup character, already, and all your? Yeah, this gonna put me really low dude. So if I apply time, they did something apply. Alright, I don't mean that the expense of your character but he's ninjas have been pretty worthless.

02:04:48

I'm at negative three. I'm down. So, that was him.

02:05:01

You, you

02:05:19

Try it.

02:05:26

And,

02:05:37

Okay. Yeah, and OG's just gonna go down, he's not gonna use resolve. No. No. I don't think that's a very good idea way in reappears and stabs one of the Tengu in the thigh.

02:06:16

And have double moves there.

02:06:26

Well yeah.

02:06:35

Important to come backcast. For that, but she's targeting here. So again.

02:06:52

Really quiet.

02:06:58

He fails the cast defensively, but refusing to let her little birdie go. Oh, she can't pass the move action because she had to move.

02:07:24

Grayson. Okay, it's gonna start moving.

02:07:42

Well it's great to know what the fucking already and we'll do us the service of that 50. That's one move and then we'll start a just double moving.

02:08:02

The handy 80 and he'll just run right up next to the guy and that's his turn.

02:08:28

You hear screeching, Raven's voice beginning to cast the spell and just get

02:08:42

Lemon Nature's Allied 3. And with the 35, I will tell you he is summoning air element rules.

02:08:52

Oh, goody

02:09:04

Bringing us to Shoko.

02:09:11

Where is it one? Nope, not that way. Up these stairs.

02:09:39

Okay, circle and shove his way past Zeo.

02:09:55

Where is the bird? You have no idea.

02:10:06

But you can hear him.

02:10:13

This flock of Ravens, are they about to come together and open window? They're outside though. Yeah, they're playing around the tower. Okay asleep.

02:10:47

Default to their doom. That's so lucky. They were also flying over a bonfire. No, they're just flying 80 feet in here. I'm still gonna roll the damage and see, but it is more than likely that they're dead. The storm only has 18 HP. They're dead and I'll be shot.

02:11:12

Goes turn and falling is clutching damage. Oh, dear form.

02:11:33

Plus it's busy little bit.

02:11:45

I'm sure you wonderful people have some sort of plan. I'm sure you do. My plan is to stop bleeding. I recommend it. Uncheck, if you believe.

02:12:04

And fortunately that is one short but you do not stabilize this room. Okay, what happens. Never died before. Minus one more HP, negative 4.

02:12:41

Why is it doing that? I don't know doing what he's committed. Negative 11, it's I tried to just change it to four and it took it as subtract 4 from my total twice. So yeah, I think. Yeah. Oh, she's dead. I died. I've lost vision. I'm really dead.

02:13:12

Okay, want to do?

02:13:23

Oh, I accidentally deleted you. It looks like he. Alright go ahead and throw Jordan in this room. That's my new character.

02:13:39

You information tracker.

02:13:47

Okay, the exact same role you got before, huh? There's two of me in there now thing. Yeah, they're two of them in there. Oh disappeared, but that's fine. Yeah, I deleted the old one, the boom like videos.

02:14:14

You. The only thing stopping them from swarming. You is the tango in the way.

02:14:35

Their place, we just intense.

02:14:52

Video.

02:14:58

I can move over there, right?

02:15:03

Uh, yeah. That's one.

02:15:09

Well, I'm not I'm I'm to go ahead and, you know, use this on the same, the same thing. You grab it with trying to beat up on one missiles. Hit kick them down the other one with left or the other one.

02:15:31

He is still up.

02:15:37

Oh, that's the end of my turn.

02:15:42

Now, it is his turn and he is a monkey, stabbing him in the crotch and the grace, the next one. Not sure which is more terrifying. The legs are right there, man. It's true. He will swing at the door and I believe Miss. Correct.

02:16:09

And,

02:16:14

You bite.

02:16:20

Look.

02:16:32

Though, this monkey starts scrambling all over him blaming and biting.

02:16:45

I'm gonna say when he technically gets detected. No, is signing in doesn't provide you and is not invisible. That Raven. Swarm is dead.

02:17:07

Quiz going to step into the square over him so she doesn't have to roll shit.

02:17:19

21 points. Hell yeah.

02:17:29

Phone. She moved great sand.

02:17:35

A concentrime perception. The fact that pinpoint the like the location of the the changes or casting

02:18:00

It sounds like it's coming from the other side of the tower.

02:18:15

All right, I might regret this Grace is gonna try to like run over there. Obviously not a run maneuver, but

02:18:32

I'm sure there's a text opportunity. So There are from two tengo.

02:18:44

But let me quick.

02:18:54

So, the first one gets a 16 hit Artemis. The second one is against your flat-footed AC with the 15. Also a mess. Very nice over them. Give me now resume.

02:19:18

And he's gonna take a Was it called perfect strike. Shot. The one where he rolls twice and uses the better attack. Sure Are we sure words doesn't have deflect arrows. So it'll be the 29 to hit. He's trying to attempting to interrupt the spellcast,

02:20:00

Not key roles this.

02:20:08

Don't roll the twice. The 13. You interrupt. His spellcasting Everybody. In this term Grayson will like narrows his eyes. He feels like he's got unfinished business from when he tried to take the bird down back at the temple. Yeah, definitely man. Everyone's got even with this bird.

02:20:38

Boom.

02:20:44

The bird narrows his eyes at you.

02:20:51

Pause out. Something else in druidic.

02:21:01

It's not.

02:21:06

And a wall torrent of wind appears between the two of you.

02:21:30

This is therapy, all right. Boom. The Tango like panic swings at the flying gold helm Mrs. Choko.

02:21:54

To find know.

02:22:02

Swarms are very annoying. So,

02:22:09

What? I'm like that. So that just in case somehow, the swarm in the Tango are both to HD. They are both for HD actually. So which one would you like to target of it would be the swarm because the storm is closer to the epicenter. Little boom. But at the past outs form,

02:22:38

Some very effective uses of sleep today. Yes. Incredibly Anyway, and this is a very useful spot But 20 20. Hmm.

02:23:02

Yeah. Okay.

02:23:06

Um,

02:23:15

Schwing.

02:23:23

The nope. Nope, nope. Nope.

02:23:33

That deeply into the tengo who squats that, you much the same way that It oats you squawks.

02:23:46

It's the death car. People are probably going to hate me for saying this, but I note that they probably have blurup. Oh yeah, they do. Hope they're up. These are the competent Ninjas. I forgot the boom. You still had like the blurred vanishes for a moment. I'm just put this right here.

02:24:14

Oh look. And then just kind of looks urgent. Just like what are you? Come on. Very tired. Is it? No way. Adjust her glasses. Slightly in the blurriness goes away. This would experiment. That's pretty thematic edge. Ochi is going to stand up. Probably get stabbed. We'll see you were club-footed before.

02:24:46

Yeah. Does me now standing count as acting? They all look up everything, so that'll be a miss then actually he doesn't have combat reflexes. I'm helping You are helping I guess that's just what I would buy on ninjas who were trying to help points in area. I know, right?

02:25:14

These are terrible or Carol, ninjas. They're terrible news. I stand and swing on that boy. You hit him that boy and that's pretty much going to be the turn for me. Unfortunately. But look at how sweet their faces are. Why would you ever want to hurt them?

02:25:51

Look at those spaces. Why does that one look cuddlier than mine? I don't like how they've drawn the floof here. It looks more like he's diseased.

02:26:06

I'm in their feathers. He's part sheep. I know he's bird sheep just tell that they're supposed to be bushy feathers but it looks more like just corpse skin to me and anything else on your turn out. She. No, that's all I got really or even swarm continues to use.

02:26:45

Lines over and tried to head button but it is not it.

02:26:56

Deal.

02:27:05

Forget that guy. And hit it with the snowball, right? No, no. I got a blur effect going. I roll for my cool blur. By the way. Oh yeah.

02:27:28

I mean, I liked it better when you hit

02:27:38

Will leave the head. The snowball collides with him academic muscle, the magic missile collides with him. But here in my turn. Angry ninja is unconscious way and takes full round action, and slits his throat.

02:28:08

I don't think she was a little monkey. Just gets done. We've done a switchblade.

02:28:18

The monk is growing on me.

02:28:31

Who loves fortitude and still does in succeed, that was really good role.

02:28:45

On the hey, fucking birds. Not you OG, rude.

02:29:11

There's nothing to huggle his beak. Bounces off of the tiny Cassian, angel.

02:29:19

Who has DR10 or 5 cold, iron or evil. She. Oh yeah. But with a boom, boom.

02:29:37

They're 26 back to OG.

02:29:42

Yay. Amy both as an activist. I think anymore. Is it? No, no, it's not.

02:29:56

And then she's down in a couple.

02:30:06

And exclude, the two tango.

02:30:14

But Jesus, it's 19, never mind. She excludes all the enemies.

02:30:27

Out the room. Jason.

02:30:39

What size category is this Raven? It's Tony.

02:30:50

Oh my gosh. Sure I'm gonna I'll try this. I maybe this is a big mistake. Chris is going to try to run right through the wind wall.

02:31:06

And then he's gonna try to grapple the Raven.

02:31:15

He doesn't have any improvers and so I think it gets into tech opportunity against him. Do you have it or not? Combat. You know I'm strike, right? Yeah, you could but I try to grapple and let them not fun. It's you. You the same thing. It's the same thing under old scrables up in the room whatever you want to call the same page.

02:31:39

So CMP check or his the fiber that is two Program.

02:31:51

Already. So, add two to whatever this is though. Like maybe sense. Evades you? And that's my turn and boom. He's going to, but I would step.

02:32:27

Connected back footstep. Nope. It's it's the movement speed that affects it, not their size.

02:32:50

You see if this ability is in the features, can bend him up.

02:33:04

It's the one. I hate loading and thanks forever.

02:33:40

In the end.

02:33:57

Raven cause and bless a multiple electricity at you.

02:34:06

Assume a screenshot touch attack. Yeah. 29 would hit my touches. Like, that's the best he got. Just look fucking channel domain. Domain power from working air clerics. Well, you did have like seven swarms of crows and ravens and shit. So By the way that damaged on, yeah, the damage is off because it's trying to calculate its cleric bubbles.

02:34:36

Lettuce, Druid levels.

02:34:40

Minecraft the wrong one.

02:34:49

Really.

02:34:54

Okay, we will put the damage. Four much better. Much better was a 50% improvement even or 100% improvement 100% improvements below. This tengo who is somehow still alive, it's actually advantages.

02:35:34

About boom.

02:35:45

And swing this and Mrs. Terribly. What a waste of advantage. Choco.

02:36:02

I mean, If it ain't broke.

02:36:15

I meant to just get the video. Do you know? Oh, all right. He's not sleeping, he took a double shot of espresso.

02:36:35

No way. Especially actually no. Can I go back to my turn because I do on my mood left and

02:36:50

Okay. It's not it's not letting me show me along you all there dies.

02:37:04

Hmm, I guess I can't move. I guess I'll be the end of my turn. Is where do you want to go? Oh I'll seeing like right here or so but yeah yeah, I don't know outside because it's

02:37:26

He has left this plane. Here you go.

02:37:33

Huh, I can't see through here. I don't wall there. Yes, it is Then I guess I'll keep going and 10:15.

02:37:52

Can I keep going?

02:38:09

Then I guess I'll get to here. And then drop my shield and my weapon at the wedding and enter, No way. What would I like to do?

02:38:28

Five foot. Hey buddy. Hi.

02:38:43

One.

02:38:49

Output workouts. Yep. Blur. Oh yeah.

02:38:58

You eat.

02:39:03

Other hand. You eat. What's the concealment chance on blur 20? 20%.

02:39:25

Did not want to get myrtillated. No. He but zero HVXE, you want to just hits him with the five point, exploding heart taking like you want to just

02:39:45

Okay, I'll give him a poke. You don't have to.

02:39:56

I'm sorry. Is he bleeding? Is he and see your plansing shaking there? No. Because that was he down? And will he starts to? He's just staggered right, Right? Yeah, but if it goes anything he'll follow that is also true. I don't think Ouchie's smart enough to like eyeball that.

02:40:18

I think he's still gonna take this swing out of

02:40:27

Get them bird boy. So we'll do our swing there.

02:40:34

It goes down and then we will do one of my Ochi sprints

02:40:45

Can I go there? Yeah. Like through that area. Those Ravens are unconscious just you know, lightly.

02:41:03

Collides with wall. But I want to end up, then I go there. Yeah.

02:41:11

He can swing up. If he got one, he will through this square.

02:41:22

Bring with the short. Oh, gummy yay. But it just did something in this campaign and that will be okay. They did drop. They did. Drop Ochi they did. But that was the best. They had performed this entire book and you all know it, they could have killed me. I could have been dead if they had chosen to kill me and if your friends had an all piled up, they would have slit your throat Just letting you know.

02:41:56

The bones elk wall. There was a lot of headbuts again. There was a lot of gods mercy in that two rounds.

02:42:06

Well, you can't take time to code across someone really. When someone's right next to you takes opportunity being what they are. Looks at several beats that allow you to do that. Hmm. Oh, did we think they're high enough? Level to have those. Yes, as an actor, I will move.

02:42:25

We still gotta you gotta roll the concealment for my swing on bird guy that I killed and

02:42:38

Are we higher low? And what is borderline do? I don't actually know what an exact 20 does. That's like count mess. It's a mess. So what you're doing it and run away and run away? Yes, 1920. So 15% miscounter that sorry. Okay, so that's what you get when he runs away and then he drops because he was at zero.

02:43:09

Hemorrhi. What? Because I say if I took the swing and missed, I still would have ran over here. Yeah, so this is exact opportunity swing, which is an action. Gotcha. Cool beans. So he's still drops. He may not be a negative 9 anymore but he's a negative one and it was so cool that to everybody else had looked like we tried to swing at each other but I hit him and he died side.

02:43:41

I think if these guys are he is still up. Yes. Like he's gonna tell everybody, but like the stat board is gonna show. That is no way is kill. Probably there. And my heart. No, it's a supportive here. She just kind of gives you a thumbs up in the background like, no, no.

02:44:01

You can take credit, less people talk about me that happier right way. Leaves. The body of the corpsea just slits, throat of just covered. It's ready to the next one. Material spray just a fully red monkey.

02:44:26

And then he leaps onto this one and starts. Stabbing it. Uh, yeah, there's actually exactly what it does but he misses with his steps. Basically a gremlin. And I've never seen that movie just like spinning out like hellfire and climbing all over people and stabbing them repeatedly. Like I say the monkeys growing on me, we will cook monkey have weapons for us.

02:44:52

Yes. Is he hitting with strength? Yeah, he said he was strength.

02:45:02

It's because of his rage. He can't contain it his best friend. Ochi almost died. So he's just really stabbing them. He really is Yes, but that still wouldn't hit. Yeah. Obviously, you know, I thank you for letting me know Now. He has a plus eight to hit with his beggar.

02:45:22

No.

02:45:28

And about God. He's surrounded know.

02:46:07

Us to players turn.

02:46:14

To come right here. Still can't see you greasing. And the boom.

02:46:30

Upon Koia is the most reliable. Healer ever. Grayson healing. Make it around the corner to the factory. Does not unfortunately Well, I made the birch still right? It sight of me. So, is he do flurry of blows plus key shot?

02:46:57

Person, kills the bug.

02:47:02

Grace would not have killed the bird. If it wasn't for that crit found that still. That's it. Actually confirmed it actually confirms because his AC is exactly 22.

02:47:22

Both bump. And worlds, the blood feather Raven falls from the sky for the last time because that also far exceeded his constellation of 12 here. So forward to like see where he falls to be like, oh we need to go like find that body just to be sure or something.

02:47:48

So like when he impacts on the ground, is he like burning toward love, Druid body? Or it was he actually a bird? He was actually an awakened Raven.

02:48:01

I thought about testing that and using a arrow of being against beasts that we had found while yes, it would have worked on him because he became a magical beast after the awakening spell. Okay. So, what is outside this window? Is it that like back Glade thing that we saw No, from this window?

02:48:30

You can see the roof, the long haul. And then the clips. Mmm. Does it look like there's any way for us to get there? Like, does he see a pathway or doors? Who wear So wherever the body is, I know, you'd have to go outside and climb around the edge, okay.

02:49:01

You could do that from the the dell though.

02:49:11

Oh actually. No wait. Hold on power is right there though. He is actually on top of the roof. Lung house, excuse me, my bed.

02:49:27

On that site, he would fall directly onto the roof of the longhouse Ravens on the other side. Fell down the cliff.

02:49:38

So he's only like 20 feet down, not a very tall tower.

02:49:48

Okay.

02:49:57

Worlds, does not get a chance to stabilize for me that negative 20,

02:50:07

Which is Making its choco stern.

02:50:23

All right, did we did we kill the Ravensworm? The one that you knock unconscious? Yeah, Nope. No one's texted who we should probably take care of that. How long you sleep last night? Here you just Okay. We could just leave it only go. I mean, people get out of the way I can take care of this to the swarm.

02:51:11

But also with his death, the wind wall goes away. I will let you know right now that with Woz's death, the Raven Swarm simply dismissed. Let me actually give you descriptions. So the room that you were having this fight in Windows, open to the elements, bring a chill to this room.

02:51:31

A fireplace stands against one wall. It's Ashley's cold next, to a stack of firewood. A trapdoor with a wooden ladder leading to it opens the ceiling to the southwest. But six, light concerts faced about this chamber with a small footlocker. Next to each Grayson, the 20, The blood feather Ravens chambers, This chamber is empty of furnishings on the floor is splattered with bird.

02:52:00

Droppings room's door has been removed but half open shutters bear, many marks and scratches covering two arrow slits in the walls unless the ragged blankets and bits of thatch and straw lies against the center of these wall. Large black feathers are scattered about the room. Lying thickest around the nest and then the final one, This chamber holds this simple bed and a table.

02:52:25

Bearing a water pitcher and basin a fireplace stands in the eastern wall.

02:52:34

That this room?

02:52:44

I think people were still in combat. We are still in combat. This bird had a nicer room than I did back in the cut. Okay. Well that's my movements. Oh no, I have actually 10 feet more. So, then I'll go over here and I guess I'll double move.

02:53:13

Oh, more. Okay.

02:53:23

That appears to be everything here. No way. See why we would still be in combat because there's still a tango alive.

02:53:38

Hmm.

02:53:45

Five footsteps and acute the graph.

02:53:52

On our good. I think it's that one. Whichever one is currently, I know, one of them is. Yeah, this one. Yes, this one. Cool. Pretty girl. Oh, daycare. Is he? No, he's dead. No. I was about. So I'm using Wakazo shoes, which means that it's like timed three so that the chances pretty terrible good.

02:54:17

Yeah, nope. And that's my Before. I'm actually, So,

02:54:27

Oh, gee perception. We got the Tengue, right? Are these Ravens still alive. They should have dispersed snow, They are a sleep right now. But they will disburse when they awaken. We're still in combat rounds because of loads. Can I know that? No, no. You're still comment around because of the one who used vanish.

02:54:53

He's around here somewhere. Okay. OG delay until he appears.

02:55:20

Video.

02:55:27

Move to here. And I'm going to attempt, we take acid spell, I'm gonna hit it. Glitter dust.

02:55:39

Here.

02:55:48

Input radius strand.

02:55:58

Thick corner. Here we going right there.

02:56:13

All right. That thing appears, okay.

02:56:19

Through. I tried to find him. It was a good try.

02:56:29

Apparently we hope it became foot slanted. He's a little tipsy on his feet now.

02:56:42

So,

02:57:05

My kids.

02:57:10

Single shot.

02:57:16

Don't think then it's quite a slept, but it does hit every left footed.

02:57:34

Pack by 13 damage. Oh, the tengu appears. Boom. And then,

02:58:03

Oh, it's already got it in there. Still didn't very nice.

02:58:11

Need two to That really hurt. Poor quite a lot.

02:58:24

And then it's immediately her turn.

02:59:02

And then Koya, throws her star knives, at him, and knock his ass out the window.

02:59:23

Does anyone have a way to deal with poison?

02:59:29

That is a big no steps for Nomi's anti-toxin, which coya drinks.

02:59:41

Okay, I was about to head over and give her my own antitoxit, but doesn't that? Doesn't she still? Oh yeah. Yeah, Scroll of Lester restoration without remove any. Yeah. From there. I'll restore the damage but it won't get rid of the hose. Oh my god, max damage book times.

03:00:05

I know the first one was actually only two.

03:00:15

The anti-toxin is still there. Little plus. Oh yeah.

03:00:27

I didn't know better. I'd say you really want to die. Um, Brain, trying to remember.

03:00:45

Oh yeah, it's gonna cast spell on herself.

03:00:58

More importantly. What kind of place most that? I wonder. Let's played that was round. Three. Does inspire courage give set? No, it doesn't give him. People says you guys maybe watching play a die. Oh thank god. Heck no bro. How safe Sorry. It's just coyas built different, I'm good.

03:01:27

By the way, you go over to quiet, doesn't definitely say. It needs to saves, but is that one that we I'm pretty sure it's too, that would really suck but at least she doesn't take any contest around.

03:01:47

By the way, I'm casting this inquire. Oh, she's gonna stoop down and like, put his hand on their shoulder. Like, he's worried.

03:02:01

We're out of combat rounds, right? Or we keeping them off for the poison. Or you can see one round for six rounds. You can Is it consecutive saves that? Just says, two saves two seconds. So she needs to save again By the way. I didn't. Okay, let me put that on here.

03:02:32

As Jesus Christ. She's already getting like some kind of bonus from like an anti-toxin or anything like that. Gonna heal skill helper. Yeah, you know, hair was them. Ochi has heal. If he could do anything to help he would be. Oh yeah. Does she have? Do you have to a two dual cloak of resistance to use it?

03:02:55

Or could I just scrape it around us over? I don't think there's an attainment time. No little skill. Let me see it matter. But no streets poison. It's a standard action. He's going to take more damage every time. The poison character makes sense or against poison. You make heel check if your heel check exceeds DC of the poison, the character receives a plus.

03:03:24

Four competence bonus on this on the saving throw against the poison. That's a no, I throw the cloak of resistance on her. All right, another plus one then

03:03:40

Come on, clear.

03:03:46

Oh no, I that's a plus six. So a 15, there's not enough that was around four. Why is she not rolling? Any ones don't know, man. I don't want anything to happen. Sequoia By the way. At this point, the opposite goes into a handy habitat and pulls out a potion.

03:04:25

Okay. And has her drink it. I fully thought you were about to be like, any drinks? Just stop with the pregnant puzzles. Boom. Exit, Didn't we establish? The restoration wasn't gonna do anything, They can yield the damage, the currents there, for sure. No. Yeah, that's what it out. We have multiple potions and the scroll of it.

03:04:55

Now. All right, Here on round five. Leave a gun persons.

03:05:07

All right. Now, damage this round. I think that was your final round too? Nope, Round six is the final round. She makes it with a 25 Sequoia. Is fucked the hell up? Hmm, composers. Don't do anything. Nor there. I'm making shits up says Grayson poisonous. The worst fucking mechanic about.

03:05:35

Actually it's much worse than unchanned or better depending on who you ask. No, no, no, no, no. Not from not from like fucking viability point of view. Oh no. No, I'm speaking entirely from a quick air perspective. Do do not play iron gods with the Unchained. Yeah, boys. It's, It's both so weak.

03:06:00

In any way, a player could use it that you cannot make a viable character built around poison and expected lies a complete life. He has a Abby said, challenge accepted. I literally have a character but I have a character that is literally set up to do nothing. But pretty much poison people with one little nick from her.

03:06:23

A rapier Koya? Are you all right? Yeah, you guys have another rank. So let's continue that OG Shagan. Her shoulder, Are you okay? Koya. Koya say something that was the most intense poison I've ever encountered. You are very, very strong my friend. I'm glad you're still with us. Pretty sure I saw stars there for a moment.

03:06:54

Tesla's not ready for you yet. Here's my journey is not a defend. You've got another 90 years in UI. Swear. Ha, I hope not. So I think for today it's probably for the best that we get you back with the others, we have to take off. All right, all right.

03:07:21

We'll see you next week that time already. You. Yep, but if we play this, like later in electric, I'll be up here. The whole game. We won't have this issue. Next time, I had the decouple of walk-ins that were unscheduled. No race. All right. I'll see y'all guys next week.

03:07:46

I would not want to leave you without your, I am. Alright, to go on Only continue with us. If you can Kwaya, we don't want Shoko shakes aside and says would you will be fine on our own for the rest of us? We don't We will not, but you can say that between the potion and the scroll, she's actually only down three con.

03:08:15

Now. Oh, okay. Well, from 13 cotton, We can absolutely give her another potion of lesser restoration. I'm sure we have them. Actually, wait the chi. She did prepare lesser restoration, hang on to the potion.

03:08:42

He casts, another spell does this healing lights surrounds her and she hops back up to her feet, as Giddy is the day. She became a priestess See, that's not sure back. She's just little late, Well trials and tribulations, young. Knowing that's not expect us to go through them. Grayson, what were you doing over here?

03:09:05

I nearly died, just enjoying the view. Um speaking of which and he Grace is gonna try to climb out the window. Oh just gonna look out and see what the heck you were looking at. While he was getting murdered, You're gonna free climb an icy tower. I thought you said it was only 20 feet down, it is only 20 feet down a very fast.

03:09:30

I see a very fast 20 feet here. Oh gee. Oh, hold this rope. Okay, much better. How much do you weigh? Oh god, great question. Hold on a second. What I'm hearing? A stupid ideas. What are you trying to do? I like to think that like, no, I just tons the corner and it's just you with your leg out of a window.

03:09:55

He just like, what? Why of so much to live for? She says it's dead. It should be on the summary page. Yeah, it's on the summary page. Under your religion, near the rest button.

03:10:15

185 pounds. Yeah I don't know. The Ochi can hold you. Let's his 76 pounds of gear. Yeah you're like I don't know sorry. 40 pounds of gear. That's still 200 something pounds. I am a very, very tiny bird, man. I weigh a hundred pounds. If I'm closed as well, though, My drag is 650.

03:10:42

I'm trying to look for where that is on my sheet, it's on your inventory, tab. All the way to bottom, okay. I mean, now we're just kind of looks at you looks at the rope looks outside. Like pans down the thing. What are you trying to do? Hold on, we're doing something.

03:11:00

Go ahead. I got you in. His arms are shaking the whole time. All right. Recent climbs out and slides down the rope, okay? It's still gonna be a DC-10 even with the real because it is an icy wall. So, If you want to take 10 on it and go, slow and steady, you get down without any issues.

03:11:23

Okay. And you collect a bird. Yes. So I I don't know if there's any actual magic items on or not, but that's not the point of this because Grayson is going to make sure he's dead and then it's going to pluck his feathers, including the blood red ones and he's gonna plans to use them to put on his arrow.

03:11:45

Fletchings. Oh, that is pretty neat. Actually, he's just like yo dude, what the actual foot? What have you never killed and eaten a chicken before? I've never skinned a person who looks like you right next to you. You don't look like him. Hey he just you're planners may be blood red 'cause you're covered in blood all the time but but you're not in him.

03:12:22

My own blood. It is his own blood a lot. Oh my god. Oh Jesus. Fine. You guys done fucking around. Can we get back to saving on the go fucking around? He killed the guy that almost killed us three times. There's a trap door over here too. That goes through the ceiling.

03:12:45

Oh, she's gonna say a prayer over all these dead Tangu and the Ravens and our special Raven to Hey Fang, just murmuring under his breath.

03:12:57

Should I just put in miscellaneous gear? Just like a big handful of Raven feathers I you can do that. Yeah. And he does have a small ring on his foots that resizes to medium size and a scrollcase containing a scroll of Summon Nature's Ally 5. Wow. What are you seeing over here?

03:13:19

Shoko, Where does this? Go. It goes up. You have to climbing letter.

03:13:27

Shall we continue? There's also the fireplace up here but contains a flu Grayson offers the the ring to shoko or one of the other casters to identify OG will go take a look at the fireplace because he's the one who read and remembers the and stuff about the chimney flu.

03:13:51

Which I think you already gave us it on the loot sheet but, you know, checking all the boxes. What is it all? I don't applying Starcraft Spellcraft. Yes. So scattered about in the first room where all the Tango were probably not. You get all of this. I'm so sorry.

03:14:12

Abby, there's a lot from this session. I'm not doing it for this game, It's amazing. Yeah, it's grace. And Grayson is our hero for this game. There's so many of these that we need to. Like make sure we say that we drag them out at the end because there's a lot of like really heavy stuff like the bales of the wool that are like 500 pounds, the owl chemical set, that is like 175 pounds, all right?

03:14:43

And in the flu of the fireplace, you find a sturdy, kind of dirty pair of leather and fur lined boots, swag, you very nice boots. I pull them out and I look at them and I sit down on the little stool right next to me with a mirror. And I try them on.

03:15:10

And then some Tango dude wearing like a referee shirt comes over and asks me if I'm finding everything okay that's there.

03:15:23

No, I don't actually try them on because I have cool shoes already but I do want to see what they are. And shovel with that ring shoko The bill bring a protection. Plus one, Would you like to drive for the boots? Look at these cool shoes. I found Shoko slash koya.

03:15:58

Well, times in me, not your not your thing.

03:16:10

McCoya says, those are really cool shoes OG. Thank you for sharing a well you both know they're magical.

03:16:24

And image at their tractor level. Nope, it's the Winterland. So, theware of these boots is able to travel across the snow at their normal speed leaving. No tracks. Additionally, the boots enable her to travel at normal speeds across the slipperiest ice. Horizontal surfaces, only not vertical or sharply, slanted ones without falling or slipping.

03:16:51

Finally Boots of the Winterlands warm their wires. If they were affected by an endure element spell constantly, Those are the opposite of ice gates. They are yes. If we're heading up north after this, eventually those might be super useful. For example, they'll be super useful. Oh, where did Noe go?

03:17:15

Oh, you guys messing around with like Now he's probably gone back looking around trying to figure out where we haven't gone because we are missing one. Commandotsu and one Scion. Yes, you are. Well there's a ladder house. There's a ladder up right here.

03:17:40

But I agree, we'll go. We could sweep on the way down, there's just a ladder with the trapdoor and the ceiling up here. Still. I mean, feel free to check it. Shoko. I'm not feeling super great. Would you mind checking this out?

03:18:01

Soco gives you a look. I just remembered what it looked like the last time show was the one that was asked out fucking door. Any size and stop climbs up and tries to open it. Let me guess strength. Isn't high enough again. No, you're fine. Okay, it just opens it's not locked or anything.

03:18:30

Open. Boom. Apparently that's square isn't working the way. It's supposed to the rooks nest, they wouldn't platform has been built into the Thatcher of the Tower. It is backed by wooden siding. While the far edge is a shear drop off to the veil below trap doors sits in the corner of the roof.

03:18:49

And a small wired coup was a wooden table next to it sits in the shelter formed by the roof's peak entire platform and joining group are thick with bird droppings and numerous blackbirds Flutter around and croak ominously. Have United grapple one and keep it But you finally catch a raven.

03:19:13

Italian and sitting in the bird droppings. Gaining brightly because it's diamond shine, bright like a Batman.

03:19:35

That is all that's up here. Yeah, that was worth looking up there. Yeah, diamond.

03:19:48

I'm just gonna, So I bought like an animal training kit and like a little birdcage when I was gonna get a bird, but then I took it off my sheet and gave myself the money back because we said that I couldn't have one, I couldn't buy one and calls guard.

03:20:05

Sorry, So OG's, just gonna bare hand, stick it into his backpack and then close the backpack. Okay. There's a flurry of angry squawking coming from OG's. Backpack that for once isn't coming from here.

03:20:21

Just wait, calm down.

03:20:29

I don't even know what to call this scenario. Cheer, are you able to talk to crows or Ravens? No. Do you even more reason why? You're not one of them. I'm going to win, aways.

03:20:47

Noise. Like just probably marched off. Probably halfway down the tower and is the bottom looking awaiting for you guys reason, just shrugs and rolls his eyes while looking at that Shoko and Zeo to be like,

03:21:12

I'm stuck in the tower now.

03:21:25

And I mean, flip, You were trapped in a stairwell.

03:21:44

I'm just gonna put everyone down here.

03:21:56

The bones.

03:22:09

Headbutting angel, murderous Monkey.

03:22:39

Okay, so I'm trying to make sense of this year. I zoomed all the way out to look at maybe areas. We didn't explore. You have explored what you think is everything? Yeah. The only place that we didn't go was up the veil because it does look like the past continues up away.

03:22:55

I don't exactly remember the description but if they can, maybe there's more tower up there or something another, there is not actually

03:23:06

So is it just like it's completely walled in by the steep phases up there? There's not like a path to travel up that path past the bridge. There is a secret path out, but it leads out to the planes, not to a secret location.

03:23:24

Okay. So, what we're going to do here is we're going to say after some exhaustive searchings, I imagine you're going to look now for the secret door that you missed. Yeah.

03:23:43

Completely, but and paste. I mean, this is what Grayson's ridiculous perception is for. I'm surprised he didn't find it. That is true, but he checked in the wrong room, though. It was Omayani's room that you checked in. You find the secret door in the dusty. Unused storage closet. They love putting stuff in storage closets.

03:24:11

That was a storage closet. Empty storage room. Not a closet necessarily sorry it's just The room's. All look fucking same. I know they do. New people.

03:24:38

And After a squish opening.

03:24:49

I've heard people complain about this with Paisal before, but like, how you gonna make the only way to advance the plot? Be a secret door and like one tiny room in the lower level. I know there's usually a towel they get better about my player. There's usually a, what the tell on this one was that the cell was being unused by any of the months.

03:25:15

And, yeah, I get that. Now that we're down here, but like, I don't know. Like was it? Not because I speak to remember that. This guy came out of this room. And that's why I thought it was like another one of these, like, generic rooms. Yes, but there's no bed in this one.

03:25:34

Oh, of course, how could we miss that this? I don't know. It's just a real story. Killer from pies oven in my opinion. I know me putting the monk in there was actually to encourage you guys to search it. Well, I I search it. You vastly, overestimated, as this players, I mean, which is my personally, if I had gone in, it wouldn't I've gotten a free search from stone cunning.

03:26:05

If it's stone, it is stone. This is underground. And yes, you should have If you got any phenomena. All right, but again that's why we're just skipping your searching over the rest of this room again. You found it. It's there.

03:26:29

Oh, damn it, is there? Come on folks, I found this secret door. Oh. Is that how we're gonna play? Hey Koya. It's theory. 10. Gold says he gets hit in the face with another wakazashi before he like actually sees who swings it. Oh, she's never gonna kicks. Open this door.

03:26:54

Overcome a brazier in the corner of this room, flows, faintly with red colds, it's smoke. Reminiscent of the stench of scorched flesh, A short bed with a headboard carved with the image of an open mouth demon stands against one wall and a small table cluttered with books scrolls and a stuffed and mounted sturge sits across from it.

03:27:16

That's gross. A magic circle has been scribed in the center of the floor with chalk, torn paper, but bits of food and other. Debris are scattered about the room collecting in corners and under the bed and table. What's up with all those papers? Anything cool or interesting in there.

03:27:37

Last The items on the table. Hold an assorted paraphernalia related to magic research, including a partially ascribed. Scroll of planar binding. The scroll is incomplete. The circle on the floor is an outline for a protective circle. For use with the planar. Binding spell examination of the brazier confirmed that strips of dried flesh, have been burns in it, to create the repellent odor.

03:28:12

That's horrifying.

03:28:19

I do not know of any mantras that would involve stripping the flesh and wearing it on display like that. Hey Zeo, you might know some stuff about this. What's up with this circle? And what could they be trying to do with this? Well done. And letting you know what?

03:28:48

Well, guess not, that's right. Zio's not here. I'm so dumb. He is not here. But as you move into the room to examine the papers in the circle, a very large hand to crawled out from under the bed. Hello Guy and tries to slide your face.

03:29:16

See, You're the one that but wasn't a sword, this

03:29:30

And,

03:30:00

Is that everyone that looks like a plan? No way. You're up first. So I am. What the hell is just knowledge religion for those that have it? Yeah. How about? No hey, you born. But I actually have moments be done. And it's true, but that's fine.

03:30:39

There's anything you'd like to tell me before I take this one.

03:30:45

Yes, quiet does shall don't use slashing or piercing attacks on it. It will explode.

03:30:56

It will what Like what was? It's just. Okay. All right, so rocks. Koya and Shoko. If you guys got so fucking high, the dragon crawling hand is a neutral evil medium, undead, with blank sense and dark vision Standard Undead trade supply. It has an ability called Mark Quarry. A curling hand is a signed a quarry by anointing.

03:31:24

The hand with a drop of the intended. Quarries, blood. The hand has, though, current quarry, it automatically gains the next creature. A damages as its quarry continue to a target, it becomes aware of the target's location as if under the effects of a continuous locate creature. Spell, It also gains a plus one on all attack, roles damage, rolls and skill checks made to seek out and destroy the marked quarry this last until it.

03:31:47

Or the hand is slain husbands when damaged by a piercing or slashing melee weapon, a spray of vile, push strikes. The attacker unless the attacker makes the DC-15. Reflex saves Weapon said provide reach. Protect the attacker. Completely from a, thus first creatures, struck by pus become nauseated, for 1v3, rounds, and take 2D 6 points of negative energy damage.

03:32:16

Give you, you punch the very large hand like, what's going to stop it. And then world's just like okay no stabby, Why is so many things in here? Don't stop it.

03:32:37

Oxford. That's a really fair question. Go.

03:32:50

Okay, circle will calmly approach. The undead hand and uses on that killings. Well.

03:33:07

And roll an 11.

03:33:17

It's study. JC is unfortunately 14. Whom so you don't get him but he's not dead yet either, or you don't lose the spell.

03:33:33

All right. Enter nobody. Not made zombie tokens.

03:33:44

Okay. Phone. If you appeal, if you have a touch attack charged on your hand, can you use it in an attack of opportunity? You need? I would say yes. Okay, I'll just I just never know it varies one of those weird rules. I don't see any reason you couldn't.

03:34:12

I agree.

03:34:16

Requires, once it's up and charged requires less effort than the swing of sword. I don't use agree. He misses. Oh, gee

03:34:39

I'll go there and kick it. I don't know what my role. My bonus is all worked out to be without though it's light, so I can use finesse with it. So just be like, a melee attack, right? Yeah, you just take an AOL here, not profession. That's fair.

03:35:08

What are we doing unproficient? Martial strike.

03:35:17

The boom. You, you hit? I don't know. My damn one. Wendy three, twenty three. And he lashes out at you with a 22 hit.

03:35:37

What's a D4? How do I do a D? Oh like that. I just type backslash roll and then one d3, they go he's winning this this on our fight by a lot. It is what he is. Designed for boom. Anything else on your turn now, that's going to be it racing.

03:36:07

This will come in. See what's going on it, move up and then just as you rushes up to, he's just gonna kick.

03:36:24

And with it.

03:36:34

Kicks are powerful Boy. Yeah. Going to cast your light, our the cure serious ones, that's just going to move up and try to touch it.

03:36:55

And,

03:37:01

Is Right.

03:37:18

So plus 3 to 12 plus then another three adding her decks is a 15.

03:37:32

And she zaps the fucking undead.

03:37:44

And El Carval play over here and but the hand

03:37:59

You should also be adding text to your text.

03:38:11

I will still not fit my long shot. No way. Acromatics.

03:38:23

Why is this thing here? What? I was just a hand groom.

03:38:33

This is very clearly a spellcaster's room and not a nice spellcaster.

03:38:52

And attack does not hit that. Includes your blinking up Unfortunately. We are looking for a 19 for this beast.

03:39:07

Well, I accidentally clicked them to map Shoko.

03:39:17

Let's try that again.

03:39:25

That's better much better. Boom. Boom.

03:39:36

And he does get to make the food safe if he wants.

03:39:42

Oh, that's fair.

03:39:49

And he takes half.

03:40:02

I don't think he does. You see not a corporeal on that all done. He is a coral islanded by touching you with his blade machine. I've encourage you to just staggered pictures, break free a corporeal, unzed creature Touched by this bill instead takes, when he's supposed to damage, He just takes all the damage.

03:40:28

There's no port. He could say the Portage and save is for a living creature, trying to do it break. Free of the staggered as what oozing drugs are flush flow. It's justicated. Bones is successful. Fortitude. Save has this damage. Oh, I did not read Barn up. Then I will add HHP back to him, then

03:40:53

This poor hand.

03:40:58

Bum. Lunky can do nothing to him. The crawling hand has quarry.

03:41:11

And that is all he cares about. Now one to attack plus one damage. Oh gee. He misses, it's your turn. Okay, Let's trying to build it unarmed attack.

03:41:36

Let's see.

03:41:58

How is it for? I didn't even put that in there.

03:42:05

When D3 plus 1. Yeah, strength.

03:42:13

Do I even hit anyways? You do not unfortunately. Well you he's a lot of natural armor so you probably hit it just stuns in doing okay. Oh yeah, you can't do lethal. Can you know the feet. So I'm just punching it, which that's okay. Anyway because it's undead. It's a grace in here, But there's aggressive, want to think of them.

03:42:39

So that's because of what?

03:42:45

So 17, It's actually a lot more than that because I get my my samurai level to that damage. But if it's not least they're challenger. No. The if you use weapon finesse as a warrior poet you get to add your level as a samurai, Warrior poet and your strength.

03:43:07

Yeah. Yeah, you get precise track. Yeah. Fortunately, your attack does missed by two. Boom, cool. Yeah, it's going to concentrate. Happy Boom.

03:43:30

Boom.

03:43:37

And explodes the hand in positive energy. All right.

03:43:51

So, what do we find in here? But yeah, what you wants to look around and see if you can find anything because he's weirded out by the hand of the circle on the ground and everything, it Perception checks for me.

03:44:15

Doesn't look like an imiko and you guys have eyes that can see through time. So, except for shoka,

03:44:27

You guys on your eyes for everybody. So Grayson and the same time as Ochi, you find a hidden compartment in the Demon's head. Mouth. That Ochi finds the trigger to open it and it pops open. Right in front of you, They're doing back to back secret doors compartments. No technically you had to make two perception checks.

03:44:57

One of DC, 20 to find the hidden compartment and the GC23 to find the trigger to open it. I'm sorry. So it's secret door, through two more regular doors, secret compartment and then secret trigger. Yes, Ninjas.

03:45:20

And I'm just gonna give you the sturge one because I don't know who would cut open, absolutely serious. Anyway, Grayson, that's fair and wood Grace and starts stabbing stuff, with an arrow in his hand. Until he hit something hard and then he's like sick. Mmm. Someone's very, very testy today close to me.

03:45:44

Thanks. I'm only teasing I thought for sure you were just gonna kick the ham to death. So, you know, they're very good at kicking the hand to death, I'm sure that happened right.

03:45:59

A sensor. There's a bigger staircase down here. Who said that? 10 through. Stab you all just here, you all just here in your head immediately as you approach. The stairwell. I censor.

03:46:17

Here, very angry and OG runs up to the stairs really. Fast down the stairs. No, he runs high. He levitates No, it was coming with. I'm just whose voice is saying this and no sueys. Gave me an error and disappeared me when I landed on the thingy. The sword is saying I button start.

03:46:48

Oh my it moved me. It just didn't give me vision and moved me over here. Like as a player visibility. No, not like that interdesting. Oh it threw you behind the teleportation tiles. So if you move through them it will teleport you again amazing. Oh, These tiles. That move us are like the the puzzle tiles and like the earlier generations of Pokemon but they're all facing the wrong direction to solve the puzzle.

03:47:23

You. Ochi will politely wait for everyone to catch up Even though he's, oh, all of his feathers are standing on end. So you're just a poof ball right now. Yeah. Oh, gee has gained. What looks like 20% body mass, he looks super swoll right now.

03:47:51

That's everyone. Right. What do we seeing here? What do we see in this hallway? You don't. We're finding out. If you run into it, This hallway, lightens enjoy small chamber. With a door exiting through the south, the door is banned with white straps of iron and bears, a large heavy lock.

03:48:12

A single brazier provides dim lights to this area. That's farther down the hall. Mm-hmm. Back to. So the T stands for. So we keep going totally still to keep going. Yeah, you can go ahead.

03:48:35

There are people here. Very bony people who all turn and look at you. And then you hear in a loud crumbly voice. She said you would come. She was right. Are you ready to die as ready as you are? I'm just letting you know this troll has a charisma of 14.

03:49:12

I dig it. The ball. He is pretty handsome. Can we get a full screen? Yeah, not the word ideas but definitely all more just you can see the 14 charisma in this picture. Yeah, you can, you know, I mean he looks eloquent, he looks a little bit poetic. I'm not gonna lie.

03:49:41

So do you guys have another fight in you? Because we're not gonna get to Kimming datsu today. It's almost six my time. Now I am cool to continue but I could also go hug my baby. I'm cool to do one more. Hi, I will go with the majority. Grayson.

03:50:04

I mean, I can though feels good if this is sort of like a boss fighting, what about waiting for Brazil? But I will do either, That is a good point, I think. Oh, it's a boss fight. I think, Zia would probably appreciate us waiting for him to do this fight because it's a big one.

03:50:19

It's it's the first of two consecutive boss fights. Yeah. I think maybe then the call is that? I save it so late for sale. Everyone can enjoy it. Welcome to the final level of ravens Crag. The one we never would have found without GM Mercy.

03:50:42

This is huge finale of two. This is the big finale of book. Two, it looks sick, I'm excited. Look at these skeleton boys. You got a handsome green boy. Those are actually super old tokens that I made ages ago. They're not really up to my current standards still look sick.

03:51:04

I think you. Thank you, but those were from my role 20 days. Oh man. Galore The lore. I know it was only like six months ago or something. Yeah, not even that got this dude. It was July it. How long is this been going? Because this is always been in Foundry that I start Jade region on Foundry.

03:51:36

Yes, you did. And we could scroll back and find out. March 5th was our first session. Yeah, that's another thing to say. It's pretty early in the year. Okay.

03:51:49

Yeah. Obviously I have not done all the B series. There's way too much I do monsters as I need them. And apparently, I needed zombies for here and I didn't have any zombies ready. So I'm getting skeletons. That's fine. They're just extra. Well done zombies. There you go. Extra crispy zombies.

03:52:08

Okay. I have to go release my dogs now because they are whining. I feel I hope everyone had fun. We shall conclude book 2 next weekend. Yeah, thanks guys. See everybody next week. Hopefully take it easy. Stay safe forward to the inevitable tents in Ochi and Grayson at our next campfire.

03:52:35
