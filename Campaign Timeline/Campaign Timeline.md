# Introductions

The party meet for the first time in the [[Rusty Dragon]] in [[Sandpoint]]. Either local themselves or with ties to locals they are drawn by the call for goblin heads and the promise of bounty for each one presented to the sheriff [[Belor Hemlock]]. There have been increasing reports of goblin attacks on the locals when travelling past or through [[Brinestump marsh]]. As they learn this news from [[Ameiko Kaijitsu]] she asks them to keep an eye out for her missing shipment of fireworks, having ordered them for the upcoming festival and not recieved them yet, She offers an extra payment for any returned to her. The group asks her if there is any person of expertise on the marsh they may contact to help them locate the goblins. She recommends they speak to a halfling [[Walthus Proudstump]] who lives on the coastal portion of the marsh and to make sure and try his fish stew. Upon entering the swamp the take the northern most road heading west to speak to this halfling. They quickly encounter three goblins playing with fireworks. [[Ochitsuite Arashi]] calls out to them to lay down their arms. The Goblins take advantage of the warning and attack one of them blinding Ochi with fireworks. The goblins are dispatched quickly. The bounty hunters continue to the halfing's home [[Walthus' Home]]. On the way they are shadowed by a [[Pale Figure]] who always seems to  be travelling away from them back into the swamp. They continue on and encounter [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons]] bearing the weapons of decidedly foreign origin bearing marks of the dragon empires including wakizashis. They dispatch them. Believing them to be holdouts from prior undead related events from years past they take some of these items and continue on. Arriving at [[Walthus' Home]] they find his behavior on meeting them very strange. After being invited in they are wary but inquire of his famous stew and to sit and ask him some questions about [[Brinestump marsh]] and the [[Licktoad Goblins]] activities. Seeming to not know his own home and finally slurping down a rat in front of them the party decides something is definitely amiss. The [[Walthus Impersonator]] is slain and [[Walthus Proudstump]] is rescued from his refuge in a panic room in the back of his home. Though injured, shaken, and hungry, he will live. As thanks [[Walthus Proudstump]] gifts the heros some potions, treats their wounds, and sits with them to answer their questions. The information given includes the origin of his imposter the strange nature of it's being so far north in the marsh, The location of a witches hut further south and west along the coast. With darkness falling the companions return to the rusty dragon to regroup and collect the bounty for the fireworks and few goblin heads they've aquired. 

### Rest

Returning to [[Brinestump marsh]] with more accurate information they decide they want to investigate this [[Pale Figure]]. Retracting their steps to the point on the path to [[Walthus' Home]] where they saw the creature they set out in the direction it travelled. Finding it to be the [[Characters/4 Brinestump NPCs/Soggy Swamp Monster/Soggy Swamp Monster]] and the source of many a missing person from [[Sandpoint]]. They dispatch the creature with [[Ochitsuite Arashi]] nearly being felled. They investigate the bodies and bring the information back to town so that the victims families may know peace. They share what they have learned with the sheriff [[Belor Hemlock]] first who rewards them for the good deed.

### Rest

They return to [[Brinestump marsh]] again and head towards the [[Goblin Camp]] to the best of their knowledge. Upon arrival at [[Licktoad Village]] the adventerers find much of it in ruins and possibly exploded. After some investigation they discover the goblins holed up in one of the still standing buildings with the entry boarded up. The group pries the way open and is immediately assualted by seemingly terrified goblins including the [[Goblin Chief]] on his salamander steed. The Chief won't be reasoned with. They dispatch most of them fairly easily and take one alive with several escaping after the heros understanding that they wish to flee. Ochi insists that they will be of little danger with no chief and their number reduced but [[Grayson]] is very upset by with this sharing his mentor [[Shelalu Andosana]]'s attitude towards [[Sparing the Goblins]]. The captive is very forthcoming about the events leading to their fortification inside the building  informing the party that [[Clak-claks]] came from the south in numbers to collect a chest the goblins had looted from either a [[Shipwreck]] in the area or a [[Cave]]. They seemed disinterested in the goblins once they had it in their possession and returned south towards the cave. The party takes this information, what remains of the goods the goblins recovered (including the separate stolen fireworks), and more goblin ears back to Sandpoint to regroup and rest.

### Rest

Following up on the goblin's information about the [[Clak-claks]] incursion into [[Licktoad Village]] the party travels back to the village and follows the clear path the [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons]] cut back to the [[Cave]] through the swampy undergrowth. On arrival at the cave [[Ochi]] cuts down the vines covering the entrance. They enter and find it fairly normal until they reach pooling water as deep as their shoulders in some places. This is compounded by lack of vision in the darkness. Wading through the water they find the bottom of the body to be slick and difficult to cross. When making their way to the second disconnected exposed landing the [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons]] emerge and attack them. The heros stay close together to call out approaching enemies in the dark. They finish dispatching these skeletons and find another more [[Regal Skeleton]] in the furthest chamber in the back. This skeleton watches them but makes no move until they get close. It lowers it's sword to point it at them as a challenge. [[Ochi]] and [[Grayson]] understand the gesture and [[Grayson]] does not interfere. [[Ochi]] is outmatched and surrenders. The skeleton accepts his surrender and lowers his weapon and turns to dust in front of them leaving [[Tsutamu's Chest]] to the party as well as his weapon the [[Whispering Shrike]]. Inside the chest they find [[Rokuro's letter]] from [[Rokuro Kaijitsu]] to his son [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu]] that mentioned some secret that would be revealed at a later date but never was. The rest of it informs the party that they may find more at the old Kaijitsu settlement of [[Brinewall VIllage]]. They also find inside the chest a richly made fan with a map drawn on one side that marks the shipwrecks in the area [[Kaijitsu Fan map]]. They gather the chest to return to town. On the way out they attempt to take a different route stumbling in to a lair of giant spiders who don't spot them. [[Ochi]] insists that they are hurting no one as they have heard no reports of spiders attacking anyone. [[Grayson]] wants to clear them out for the safety of Sandpoint and the inhabitants of the marsh Ultimately [[Ochi]] wins out arguing they are too wounded to face them and they end up [[Sparing the Spiders]]. They return the way they came and depart towards the [[Brinestump Marsh Witch]]es hut on recommendation from the sheriff that they perform a wellness check. They arrive and knock and call out for her but she does not appear. They enter anyways apologizing and discover that she seems to have been a casualty of her own experiments. While searching the house [[Ochi]] discovers her [[Ratling Familiar]] who screeches at him to leave. Not wanting to be rude he asks the creatures relation to the witch and understands that she was it's mistress. Backing out and apologizing he informs the others and they exit. As they all reach the front and wonder at what will become of the place the Ratling cracks the door and throws out a bag of goods and tells them to leave. The party does.

Having returned to [[Sandpoint]] and relaying their discovery to [[Ameiko]], the remaining [[Kaijitsus]], they prepare to depart for [[Brinewall VIllage]] with [[Sandru's Caravan]] including [[Koya]] and [[Shelalu]]. They see it as an adventure. With many having no other reason to stay they all join up. Waiting on certain preparations they spend some time at the [[Rusty Dragon]] mingling and asking and answering questions. [[The Caravan]] sets out. As they near [[Brinewall]] [[Ameiko]] starts appear weak and not herself. They come to a point where the caravan can no longer continue up the path. The party travels the rest of the way on foot. They come on the remains of the place and survey the area. They first check the [[Brinewall Lighthouse]] and find a skeleton key as well as some valuables in a waterproof chest. They bring the chest back to [[Sandru]] and [[The Caravan]]. It's at this point that they realize Ameiko is extremely unwell. Koya determines that she is being possessed by a Kami which is most unusual. While Ameiko is weak it doesn't appear to be doing any harm to her. Through her it keeps repeating a cryptic message. [[Ameiko's Possesion]]

“One treasure beyond two seals in the third vault...”“Beware the birds who wish to fly but cannot...”“A key you seek lies in the grip of the ten-handed one—his fear is your greatest ally...” “Beware the cuckolded cuckoo—it is in his shattered silent love you should seek aid...” “Grandfather waits in the dark, but he knows not who he was...”

 Lacking the ability to help her they return to [[Brinewall VIllage]] believing the possessor is telling them something in [[Brinewall Keep]] is related. They check the [[graveyard]] when they get back and find no familiar names but encounter a fey creature called [[Spivey]] who has been keeping watch against the evil infesting the keep and maintaining the altar to [[Desna]] and the graves. Our Traveller's ask them about the evil. Spivey tells them they saw and felt much, Corbies, Ogres and other worse things. After hearing [[Spivey]]'s information the caravaneers promise to clear the keep so they can be free to travel again. The fey thanks them and blesses the party. They begin investigating the rest of [[Brinewall VIllage]] and come on the corpse of a wyrm ( [[Sea Drake]] ) rotting on the beach slain by manufactured weapons. They approach to get a better look and are beset by Reefclaws. They dispatch the creatures and continue on to [[Brinewall Keep]]. After some careful reconnaissance they spot some Corbie guards who don't notice them. Upon further probing of the perimeter they find purchase through one of the towers. Making their way in they climb the ladder hoping to find a good vantage to gather more information before engaging but are spotted immediately. They engage the Corbies who meet them first. Two retreat across the keep yard and up a wall to the main structure and man a catapult. While they begin eliminating the corbies close to them the others on the catapult open fire but miss. At the same time a grotesque pincered beast [[Flatbelly]] and a giant spider appear and engage the party as well. Beset on two fronts the party begin to panic. Luckily after the firing of their first shot the now obviously dilapidated catapult explodes into splinters and the Corbie operators reengage without it. The party prevails in the melee. Just when they think they are done battling however a giant bat [[Mobat]] like creatures swoops around from the other side of the keep and charges them. They shake off it's piercing howl and strike it as it attempts to swoop down on them. The creature in it's wounded state tries to flee but can't escape [[Grayson]]'s aim who ends it with a final pursuing shot.
The party returns to [[The Caravan]]

### Rest

[[Shoko]] Comes looking for [[Koya]] realizing she had departed [[Sandpoint]] and finds the party regrouping at [[The Caravan]]. He joins the party after playing a bit of catch up and hearing of [[Ameiko's Possesion]]. He recalls that [[Brinewall Keep]] is a [[Kaijitsus]] holding from 30 years ago. They set out for the keep again. Arriving at the keep they decide to enter through the front gate this time. Believing they cleared most of the Corbies and other evils from the outer defenses the travelers still proceed cautiously. Inside the gatehouse they find two dead Corbies that the party had no hand in killing which raises some suspicions. In the interest of surprise they peek out windows as they pass them and see some large creatures to the east where they have not been yet. Entering the courtyard again they encounter two wrestling Ogrekin which [[Grayson]] had spotted from the gatehouse. [[Shoko]] casts sleep on them and the party dispatches them while they're unconscious. [[Ochi]] abstains [[Refusing to kill the helpless]]. Shortly after they enter the nearest and most southern room of the keep. Inside they find [[Muthilduh]] who is angry we have killed her harem and strikes [[Ochi]] who is unaware yet of her presence. The party dispatches her also. [[Koya]] heals the not insignificant damage [[Ochi]] took in the engagement. Continuing on into the keep entering the main hall (west) they find several Corbies performing a play for a long-nosed red masked humanoid [[Kokinu]]. They sneak closer and [[Shoko]] tries to put them to sleep as well. He only gets one on the first attempt but gets more on the second. Ochi moves in a strikes the only conscious Corbie and then runs up to the [[Oni]] who has transformed into a winged Tengu form and retreats a little. Trogolodytes pour in from another room off of the hall to the Northeast and engage [[Shoko]] and [[Grayson]] filling the room with a powerful stench. A monitor lizard joins in from the same door also. The party sleeps or kills all the enemies, fighting on two fronts, except the [[Oni]] [[Kokinu]] who retreats by disappearing magically (Dimension Door). The party enters the ballroom off of the main hall (Southwest) and spots him on the balcony a floor up and they pursue. Looking out the arrow slits in their chase they spot some giant insectoid creature dwelling in a small body of water (chillin). The [[Oni]] flees again as more Corbies enter from a series of rooms to the northeast lead by a Corby priest of Pazuzu [[Nevakali]]. The travellers dispatch them all.
Ascending further they find themselves in the living quarters. Checking all the rooms one by one they encounter an [[Attic Whisperer]] and It steals Ochi's voice and is vanquished by the party thanks to [[Koya]] On the walls they discover drawings depicting Oni and Ninja storming the keep and mudering it's inhabitants. They believe the bookcase fell on the boy in the commotion. The other ghostly inhabitant in the halls outside the living quarter is the remnants of the souls of the [[Murdered Brinewallers]]. Koya puts them to rest temporarily and believes that they will find peace when the evil that took their lives and this castle is ousted. Finding much of the rest of the living quarters/ kitchen on the second floor empty with signs of Corbie habitation they also find a defaced shrine to [[Desna]] seeming to be altered to some winged creature the party failed to identify. Koya and the others attempt to clean it up. Afterwards they continue on and up.
At the top of the tower they come across a Harpy. She does not speak to the party verbally but instead they take measure of each other and she gestures for them to come closer. [[Ochi]] does and she touches him and communicates telepathically with him. She tells him she is [[Zaiobe]] and she has lost love for the [[Oni]] who they learn is called [[Kokinu]]. [[Kokinu]] serves something called the [[Ten-handed one]]. [[Zaiobe]] and [[Kokinu]] used to date. She volunteers to aid us in killing [[Kokinu]]. She has lived in [[Brinewall Keep]] for a long time. She tells that there is a [[Vault]] no one has been able to enter thus far. [[Ochi]] tries to communicate this all to his companions through a really terrible game of charades for what is far too long before [[Shoko]] makes him step aside to speed up the process. With Zaiobe in tow they all journey to the dungeon and clear a southern room containing [[Rotscale]] and two other Trogolodytes fighting for his amusement as well as a mostly scoured armory. After which they also discover strange spores in an antechamber off the kitchen to the west and after following that to it's source they find a slime creature (Phycomid) they dispatch from range. Even deeper still they find a proper dungeon containing [[Sluwort]] and some prison cells. Having the jump on him and the aid of some Alchemist's fire via [[Shoko]] and Zaiobe he is quickly ended. Inside one of the Cells the Murder Machine ™ finds one [[Kelda Oxgutter]]. [[Sluwort]] was threatening to eat her. She didn't trust us right away but after a little coaxing her story is revealed. She and her very late party were responsible for the mysterious end of the [[Sea Drake]] back in [[Brinewall VIllage]]. She was weak after the ordeal and was captured by the Corbies and Co and brought into [[Brinewall Keep]]. She offered aid and also mentioned that she needs to return home at some point and if we help her back to her home of [[Kalsgard]] her family will reward us. Attempting to continue deeper the caravaneers are confroned with a series of what seem impossibly well locked doors into a cave-like chamber we unlock one of the second lock after jamming the first one and get stopped by the third. Returning and trying another route they spot [[Nindinzego]] and [[Kokinu]] in the cavernous room off the dungeon and attempt to sneak up on them. There is a large drop in the path and in crossing it [[Shoko]] stumbles climbing down and the noise of [[Koya]]'s casting of feather fall alerts the enemies ending their ploy for surprise. Long and grueling fight ensues. There's flying. [[Zaiobe]] and [[Grayson]] carry us. [[Koya]] spends the entire time keeping [[Ochi]] alive. [[Kokinu]] is pretty much out of spells at this point and employs [[Dancing Wasp]] while [[Nindinzego]] flies high above casting down with a wand and nastier things. The party prevails. 

---

[[Zaiobe]] makes it clear that she currently means no harm to the party but considers [[Brinewall Keep]] to be her home and with no further common goal gives them 24 hours to conclude their business there before she will consider them tresspassers and slay them. The party thanks her and goes about just that.
After confirming the death of [[Nindinzego]] and [[Kokinu]] the party climbs up the two sheer drop offs constituting the way from the other dungeon related entrance. Faced with an Iron gate with a woman on it and funerary alcoves branching from the way in perpendicular fashion. Part of the room is collapsed and contains flowing motes of light. Knowledge these Alcoves contain the previous commanders of [[Brinewall]]
Still not having found anything they believe will help [[Ameiko]] they make sure they have searched the entire cavern system and dungeon under [[Brinewall Keep]]. They discover a secret sea cliff walk path that leads straight into the chamber that housed [[Nindinzego]]. 
Making their way back up to make sure they have cleared the ground floor they encounter [[Noe Icemark]], a short [[Varki]] woman with two shortswords at her sides, poking the dead bodies of the trogolodytes the party had killed in the "throne room". [[Noe]] Accompanies us after hearing our business because she loves a mystery. 
Proceeding to the back of the throne room they encounter the only door they had not yet explored due to chasing after [[Kokinu]] earlier. Using a skeleton key they aquired at some point they find It contains a hallway leading to stairs both down and up. As they enter soldiers of blood coagulate into being and instead of attacking thank the adventurers for the death of [[Kokinu]]. One of the next rooms greets them with a decrepit body opening the door which approaches [[Ochi]] and [[Grayson]] and attacks. After dispatching the [[Wight]] they enter the room he came from and find it to be an officers quarters in disarray as if raided or attacked. On the desk they find letters addressed to and from [[Andril Kortun]] the commander of [[Brinewall]]. The last of the letters is hastily scribbled and describing the attack on the keep by Ninja and [[Oni]].
The party returns the way it came and then takes the stairs leading downward. There are empty raided vaults here. An Ominous shadowy tian man confronts them. "I know this name" he says and screams in anguish. Weeping he begs them to "Take the seal away from here. Take it to my child." and disappears. Behind him is a Hidden door through which the party find 3 darkwood chests the left and right of which are locked. Opening the middle chest they find a complex and beautiful red and gold filigreed box radiating magic. it is a [[Warding Box]]. Once opened it blinds [[Ochi]] temporarily and the party detects something even more powerful inside. The source is a disc, The [[Amatatsu Seal]]. A vision overtakes the group.

### *Visions of Jade*
*An [[Oni]] army with burning skin, glaring eyes, and sharp tusks, wearing strange armor and wielding exotic weapons—emerge in a storm from a vast forest, then descend upon [[Minkai]]. This vision is swiftly followed by another: [[Emperor Shigure]] dressed in royal robes stands over a simple well, a friend at his side. Suddenly, the friend grows nearly three times in size and is sheathed in a frightening suit of jade armor. The [[Jade Warrior]] draws a sword and strikes down his royal friend, then holds the bloody sword aloft in triumph. A third vision follows, this time of [[Tsutoku Amatatsu]] a.k.a. [[Rokuro Kaijitsu]] handing the legendary sentient sword [[Te No Sui]] to a richly dressed [[Ulfen]] man, [[Fynn Snaevald]], in exchange for a bag of gold to fund his families flight. Finally, this vision fades, and we see [[Ameiko Amatatsu]] waking from [[Ameiko's Possesion]] as the [[Kami]] possesing her flys back into the seal, but she is dressed in the finery of an empress. She rises from sleep not in [[The Caravan]], but from a resting spot within the arms of a jade throne.*

These visions pass in the span of a few heartbeats, and after they do, the [[Amatatsu Scions]] are left with the knowledge that they are just that, That [[Te No Sui]] may have even more knowledge of the [[Amatatsu]]'s legacy, That [[Ameiko Amatatsu]] is the heir to the [[Amatatsu]] royal family and rightful heir of the [[Jade Throne]] of [[Minkai]], and that the [[Warding Box]] has protected the [[Amatatsu Seal]] from detection by the [[Oni of the Five Storms]] for this long and having the opened it they have revealed themselves to great danger.
With this knowledge the party opens the other chests finding more treasures that appear tailored to their strengths and quickly gather up those items and the [[Warding Box]] to make haste back to [[The Caravan]] and [[Ameiko]]. They discover quite quickly that she is waiting for them back in the throne room. She confirms she also shared in the vision. [[Ochi]] swears himself to her service and in gratitude and her newfound right grants him the title of [[Samurai]]. [[Shoko]] Warns her that she can throw the [[Warding Box]] into the sea and forget it all. [[Ameiko]] says she cannot stand by and allow the suffering under the [[Jade Regent]]. [[Noe]] asks what she will do. She believes her responsibility to the [[Minkai]]an people too great in spite of no wish to rule.
With all of these thoughts weighing on the party they make their way back to [[The Caravan]] where they determine they will head north to [[Kalsgard]] to inquire after the sword [[Te No Sui]] and the way further north to [[The Crown of the World]] and the northern passage to [[Minkai]]. After that is determined they ask more of [[Noe]]'s reasons for being at [[Brinewall]]. She says she is from very far north. Went south for "Mother's interest in chronicalling knowledge". Mother sent her to "learn about her own culture." With all the sharing going around and various bits of [[Minkai]]an spoken [[Ochi]] notices [[Shoko]] speaks the tongue as well and asks how he came to be in [[Varisia]] being from [[Minkai]] himself. [[Shoko]] says he "came here a long time ago after altercation back in [[Minkai]] and was saved by [[Koya]] when in trouble here." All the while [[Grayson]] shares hot food and strong drink with [[Kelda Oxgutter]] once again keeping up the groups hospitality. With that the party retires and rests with a long journey ahead of them.

### Rest

Those on watch hear the scrape of wood on sandy gravel as a longship beaches on the shores near [[The Caravan]]. Having been detected the [[Ulfen]] Raider's let loose cries and set upon the camp. The Scions rouse and arm themselves to take up the defense as well as [[Ameiko]], [[Sandru]], [[Koya]], and [[Kelda]]. [[Ochi]] rushes to aid [[Koya]] in her caravan after seeing several raiders enter as he does he spies a large peculiar [[Raven]] with a red feather on it's breast which flies off into the night when spotted. The fight ends with the capture of one of the [[Ulfen]]. The party determines to interrogate him. When he is less than forthcoming [[Ochi]] threatens to tie stones to the mans feet and send him into the river he came from. The man begins bleeding from his eyes and ears and quickly dies. Confused the party see if the man lives and search his body. They discover a symbol branded on his chest and identify it as a [[Blood Geas]], A mark left by the weapon [[Oathtaker]] a Tetsubo. After discussing they also determine that the longship bearing their attackers is the [[Arl's Hammer]] belonging to [[Asvig Longthews]]. Some in the party share that he is the husband of [[Characters/6 Kalsgard NPCs/Helva/Helva]] who is the real power between the two and a powerful witch. Pondering the thought of a powerful necromancer against them and the mysterious [[Raven]] as well as the social and politcal implications of this attack they make a plan to split their forces to enter [[Kalsgard]] in a way to be both less and more conspicuous to draw danger away from [[Ameiko]].
Come morning with their plan in action they draw near to the city aboard the [[Arl's Hammer]] when a strange golden [[Flying Monkey]] lands upon the bow of the boat. Calmly smoking a pipe, He is unresponsive to their questions or actions at first. Soon however the [[Xiao]] communicates to them that he is named [[Wei Yan]] and that he is an emissary of [[Shizuru]] come to watch over [[Ameiko]]. With this new addition they seek out a place to stay and gather information. Over a mix of [[Tian]] and [[Ulfen]] food and drink they as the tavern keep if there is anyone who could guide them north. They are recommended [[Ulf Gormunder]] or his apprentice [[Ukshaka]]. They also inquire about [[Fynn Snaevald]] and where he can be found. They determine to speak to [[Fynn]] first and set out for his house.
Before reaching their destination the come to a bridge with two statues on the siderails. Upon crossing the statues come to life and attack them. They dispatch them fairly easily. Afterwards they find the traces of the sigils that constituted a trap that must have been laid for them.
Continuing on to the ex-trader's house they are greeted by his house servant and welcomed in. They introduce themselves and their reason for visiting. [[Fynn]] tells them he no longer has [[Te No Sui]]. He kept it all this time and had always planned to return it to [[Rokuro]] but he never returned. He had housed and fed [[Rokuro]] during his families flight and wished them well. About two weeks past thugs in all black dress broke in and stole it leaving only a black [[Raven]] feather behind. [[Noe]] thinks these are the signs of the [[Frozen Shadows]]. [[Ochi]] shows [[Fynn]] the swords he got from the secret third [[Vault]], [[Fynn]] admires them and thanks him. At this time a page arrives bearing a scroll for [[Fynn]]. It contains a declaration of a blood feud between [[Fynn]] and [[Asvig Longthews]] over unpaid wereguilt. At this point the party decides they need to pay [[Asvig]] a visit.
Sharing all knowledge they have or have gathered on him they focus on the news that they are feasting in celebration of a funeral. [[Snorri Stoneye]] the mad reaver has just passed. He was a very powerful raider who plundered the [[Sotlands]] to the south financed by the [[Rimerunners]]. He fell ill on a recent journey and died very quickly. His assets were sold back to the [[Rimerunners]] before he was even fully dead.
They arrive at the [[Asvig]]'s hall and opt for stealth and reconaissance. Listening at different points of entry and examining the area they determine there are a large number of [[Ulfen]] raiders present and return to town to gather more fighters from [[The Caravan]]. Returning in greater force [[The Caravan]]eers debate points of entry and whether or not to burn their enemies out finally deciding on storming the rear entrance in force. Making their way in they dispatch a few who are harrassing the kitchen help whom they detain and question. Not finding much information they continue into the long hall where they come upon the scene of [[Characters/6 Kalsgard NPCs/Helva/Helva]] bedding raiders in celebration with many drunken others passed out about the place. [[Asvig]] and those coherent charge and the [[Witch]] starts working magics. Beating down the sober, slaying [[Asvig]], and holding [[Characters/6 Kalsgard NPCs/Helva/Helva]] at swordpoint they question her. 

---

She tells them that they stole the sword and an older/middle aged tian woman who walked like a figher paid them well for it. They hid the sword in a place no one will ever find it again. inferring the worst the scions belive they have put the sword aboard [[Snorri's Funeral Ship]]. the scions press [[Helva]] further and she relays that they did not kill [[Snorri Stoneye]] nor were they the ones who left a feather after stealing [[Te No Sui]]. [[Helva]] having shared this information attempts to kill [[Noe]] and [[Ochi]] intervenes preventing a 1 on 1 fight. As [[Helva]] passes strange and ominous flames forming a death's head rise from her corpse in the mark of [[Urgathoa]]. The remaing living raiders are offered work with the caravan and head back to join up. Determined to find [[Snorri's Funeral Ship]] the party quickly heads south and find [[Ukshaka]], [[Ulf Gormunder]]'s apprentice asking us to find him and if we can to bring him to [[Yin Po]] at the shrine of [[Shelyn]] in the [[Fire Quarter]]. [[Ukshaka]] tells the party the location of spear shatter harbor. After finding the location of the ship and with the notion that the missing [[Ulf Gormunder]] may be aboard along with the sword they make haste. As they approach those with knowledge of the procedure of these cultural funeral ships share it. Taking three small boats out to ferry they party they close on the funeral ship but are interrupted by a giant crab intent on feasting on them. They dispatch it and board.
[[Ochi]] quickly disables the time released fire starting method. The pass up the body on the pyre and head below decks finding it piled high with treasures but hearing the sounds of movement and chains rattling in the dark. Chained on a long lead is the dead [[Snorri Stoneye]] who is now a draugr. As they discover this there is a commotion above decks and peering back up they find [[Wei Yan]] unconscious and [[Ameiko]] missing and several figures garbed in black poised to attack as lightining unexpectedly strikes the ship setting it ablaze. Most of the party scrambles to get back above decks to recover [[Ameiko]] and [[Grayson]] fells the unliving [[Snorri]] below and quickly searches for [[Te No Sui]] and [[Ulf]]. Those above dispatch the [[Frozen Shadows]] assaulting them and [[Grayson]] find neither objects of his search but instead finds [[Zio]] bound and gagged and a strange [[Talking Helmet]]. Releasing him and making haste back up and off the ship the fire is staunched and they turn to questioning the one ninja they had not killed who quickly chooses death by leaping into the deep over betrayal.
Finding [[Ameiko]] nowhere in sight and none of what they came for the scions regroup sailing back to shor. Introducing himself [[Helgarval]] shares that he is was a familiar to a wizard who died and is now stranded on the material plane. He has spent a great deal of time following the movements of the [[Frozen Shadows]] since. On the way back to [[Kalsgard]] they discuss the [[Frozen Shadows]] hunting them and their knowledge of the group with [[Helgarval]] sharing that they have been using the [[Rimerunners]] as a front for the last few years.
With few leads the scions make way to the [[Kalsgard Shelyn Temple]] which they find crumbling and burning on their approach with screams coming from inside. Entering they see an Earth elemental standing over the body of an injured priest and hear <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"Leave the priest, Kill them"</mark> screeched from somwhere in the dark. The party engages the earthen behemoth while the voice from the dark urges it to kill them. During the fight it is identified as the [[Red Feather Raven]] that has been ahead of them at every turn. [[Grayson]] gifts several arrows to it before it flees as the group reduces the earth elemental to dust.
[[Shoko]] asks the priest what happened and he says it was basically all a blur the [[Red Feather Raven]] appeared and suddenly the earth elemental was there and destroying the place. He doesn' think it was a normal raven. [[Grayson]] agrees pointing out that he put two arrows into it and it didn't even slow it down. We make sure that priest is alright and then show him the token [[Ukshaka]] told us to present to him. [[Yin Po]] says "I see. Of course. Come with me" and shows them to the safehouse in the garden shed. On the way [[Ochi]] expresses they've been looking for [[Ulf]] but have been unable to locate him. Arriving [[Yin Po]] shows them a secret door inside the shed revealing the [[Shelyn Temple Safehouse]]. The door is currently destroyed. The party notices a large black feather on the floor they believe could only come from a [[Tengu]] as well as a dart from a blowgun. [[Noe]] examines it and determines it is dosed with blue winnis poison she describes it as standard protocol for the [[Frozen Shadows]] any targets they don't want to kill and draw suspicion to lower profile targets they'll dose with this and this is likely what knocked out [[Wei Yan]] on the [[Funeral Ship]]. Further searching the cellar they find no other trace of [[Ukshaka]]. Discussing the state of their mission they lament the fact that their enemies now hold [[Ameiko]] as well as both of their possible guides for the northern passage. [[Noe]] points out that Blue Winnis is very hard to cultivate and should make very easy ties to their foes once they can locate a source. Left with only the [[Rimerunners]] guild as a possible lead they determine they desperately need to investigate. [[Noe]] shares that it is located in the [[Jade Quarter]]. [[Helgarval]] adds that they have been extremely active recently. The party heads toward the [[Ivory Quarter]] to find accomodation and further plan their reconnaisance. Upon approach [[Koya]] is nearly killed in an ambush from an [[Ulfen]] archer on the tavern balcony. Closing quickly and chasing her down when she flees [[Ochi]] and [[Noe]] corner [[Hekja]] in the alley and intimidate her into surrendering. Finding no amount of pay worth her life she begins sharing what she knows. She was hired by [[Jorgun the Axe]] a [[Werebear]] under a [[Blood Geas]] to kill at least one of the [[The Caravan]] to reduce our number. After accepting the contract [[Hekja]] tailed him, a good habit in her profession, as he traveled north away from the city. [[Noe]] infers from this that the only suitable location to the north that the [[Frozen Shadows]] could be operating out of is [[Ravens Cragg]], a naturally and artificially fortified fortress that belonged to [[Snorri Stoneye]] north of [[Kalsgard]]. Before she can share much more information however a hand sprout from her throat spraying gore out just as [[Ochi]] and [[Noe]] were offering [[Hekja]] freedom. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Thats about what i was expecting"</mark> -[[Noe]]
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">"You dissapoint me student"</mark> -Ninja
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Sensei"</mark> -[[Noe]]
The party confused at first in the clash ask if this is someone they shouldn't be killing and [[Noe]] assures them that they want her dead. The woman is able to appear and disaapear at will making for a very difficult fight which ends with the scions still breathing and a retreating foe as well as dead assassin and a poisoned shuriken buried in the alley wall. The woman runs up the side of the building and disappears across the rooftops as [[Noe]] gives chase up the side of the building losing sight of her. The caravaneers take stock of the throwing star left behind as well as the orginal assassins horse. Understandably having many questions for her [[Noe]] urges the party not to do so in the open so they head inside the inn for some privacy. [[Noe]] informs them of her history with the [[Frozen Shadows]] a la her parentage and her tutelage under [[Omeyani]], the one who addressed her as student a short time ago. She also tells them the mastermind behind this particular band of assassins is [[Kimmendatsu]] who reports to the [[Oni of the Five Storms]]. With their foe's strength becoming clearer they also discuss [[Ravens Cragg]]. [[Noe]] notes it is a likely locale for them as most in the area only travel north to take the northern passage, The [[Path of Agenhai]]. She also reveals her true name to be [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki]], that her father is the head of some even more serious and sinister operation he was called away from the [[Frozen Shadows]] for, and that her mother [[Kireama]] took her away. [[Kireama]] was the reason she was at [[Brinewall]], sent to gain an understaning of her own family history or legacy. [[Noe]] decided then not to kill us and thus damned herself to be an enemy of her former organization. She shares some more nitty gritty on the [[Frozen Shadows]] combat abilities such as most of their number cannot perform ninjutsu like she or [[Omeyani]], and that the [[Red Feather Raven]] is somehow associated and working on their behalf or at least for mutual benefit. She assures the group that the [[Rimerunners]] guild office will hold more information for them.

### Rest

Having learned all that the party determines they need rest before they act and that they will take watches and recuperate at an inn in the [[Ivory Quarter]] while [[Noe]] does some reconaissance on the [[Rimerunners]]. In the morning the party does some shopping on the way to prepare for some of the tricks that they've seen from the [[Frozen Shadows]] so far.
While this is going [[Noe]] is carefully watching the [[Rimerunners]] building noting the points of egress and the guards number and shift changes. Only one windows is boarded up and barred. With careful prodding she finds an easy way in and finds herself in an empty office. FInding nothing of interest she continues on to more rooms peering through a keyhole she passes on a room with two lounging guards for a different locked one and picks the lock. It appears to be a storage closet at first but after careful searching she finds a secret door behind a panel. Inside she finds a trapdoor in the floor to another storage location, this one containing a heavy iron lockbox against the north wall. After bypassing the lock on that as well she finds it contains two thousand gold pieces as well as some very importnat looking ledgers and paperwork. Gathering these pilfered treasures up and peering through another portal she decides she's risked enough on her own and makes a mental note of the secret rooms location and carefully covers her tracks and makes her exit. Returning to the others flipping some of her spoils she, [[Ochi]], and [[Shoko]] gather everyone to go over [[Noe]]'s findings.
The [[Stolen Documents]] confirm that the [[Arl's Hammer]] was rented to [[Asvig Longthews]] on the night of the attack at [[Skalsbridge]] and also that he was contracted by the [[Rimerunners]] to aquire a [[Tian]] artifact from a specific address recognizable as [[Fynn Snaevald]]'s home. They also detail financial transactions of large sums over the last few years to [[Ravens Cragg]] including the artifact which is likely [[Te No Sui]]. All of these orders were approved by someone called [[Thorborg Silverskorr]] who is apparently the owner of the [[Rimerunners]]. Also included is the purchase of [[Ravens Cragg]] from [[Snorri]] several years ago.
While the group is pondering these revelations and confirmations [[Shoko]] raises the idea of using some of this information as a bargaining chip, taking these damning documents and meeting with the [[Rimerunners]] and using them to barter to get [[Ukshaka]] back, assuming that if they don't outright have her there then they'll know her location and we can liberate her without any bloodshed. The others are amenable to this idea.
As they approach the [[Rimerunners]] guild office [[Noe]] Hangs back to watch for any deceit from the guild from a rooftop across the street. The rest of the group walks straight in not being stopped by the guard outside and after some strong words to the clerk from [[Shoko]] in spite of a failed "appointment" ruse [[SIlverskorr]] agrees to see them.
[[Thorborg Silverskorr]] is right through the office door and is apparently a beautiful [[Ulfen]] woman. She asks after the mysterious item we've brought her and [[Shoko]] goes into the notion of our exchange, [[Ukshaka]] for the [[Stolen Documents]]. [[SIlverskorr]] plays dumb at first but when we mention the [[Shelyn Temple Safehouse]] and the probablilty of [[Ukshaka]] being brought here she says we might be correct. At this point we have [[Grayson]] pass the [[Stolen Documents]] forward and flash them to her and repeat the terms of the exchange. "So you're offering the documents that [[Noe]] -excuse me- [[Hatsuyuki]] (spoken in perfect tian) stole in the night?" Meanwhile [[Noe]] is across the street watching this conversation through the barred window to the office. [[Shoko]] feigns ignorance and calls out the womans feigned ignorance of the whereabouts of the guide's apprentice.
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"We could both leave here with what we want"</mark> -[[Shoko]]
"We could.... but.... what makes you think you're going to be leaving here alive" she emphasizes that we're in a building full of her guards.
The group attempts to diffuse with diplomacy while [[Hatsuyuki]] notices a rusted iron-bound massive club under the office desk. As [[Shoko]]'s speech ends [[SIlverskorr]]'s appearance ripples and changes as she transforms.

As the battle begins [[Ochi]] turns to [[Shoko]] and says <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"I'm so sorry you were right."</mark> [[Ochi]] is able to immediately identify [[SIlverskorr]]'s new appearance as an [[Oni]] and an [[Ogre]] at that. The party including [[Koya]] battles it out against the [[Ogre]], [[Omeyani]], and the [[Rimerunners]] guards. [[Grayson]] firing arrows left and right, [[Zio]] nearly freezing [[Omeyani]] in one shot right away. As [[Noe]] closes in having recognized the danger she also recognizes the transformed [[SIlverskorr]] as [[Kimmendatsu]] and says <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Hi boss"</mark> and [[Kimmendatsu]] grins back at her. Still smiling she attempts to obliterate [[Shoko]] who was left in the office alone with her but he skillfully dodges and deflects all her deadly blows. [[Ochi]] having challenged [[Kimmendatsu]] but not wanting to engage in such close quarters yells for [[Shoko]] to retreat out of the room just as [[Zio]] is nearly cleaved in half by a guard's greatsword attack. [[Noe]] having closed into the room in the fray and spotting her sensei [[Omeyani]] says <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">''where are you master"</mark> and crushes a charm in her fist and spots her magically undetected behind a very wounded [[Zio]]. [[Zio]] having planned ahead for this appears to explode into glitter revealing [[Omeyani]]'s position and retreating to safety outside magically. [[Omeyani]] Recognizes she's been had and beings making several hand signs appearing to split in two which is just in time as [[Noe]] appears and takes several swings at her, evaporating her newly made twin. [[Omeyani]] greets her with a <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">"Hello student"</mark> proving she can see [[Noe]] just as well as [[Omeyani]] can see her. Just when the odds are beginning to favor the scions however [[Kimmendatsu]] finally connects with [[Shoko]] powerfully on the backswing of another miss and he falls unconscious to the ground. [[Ochi]] sees this and tries to make his way to [[Shoko]] and fells another guard. [[Noe]] attempts to return [[Omeyani]]'s poisoned shuriken from the encounter in the alley but she catches it in midair. [[Grayson]] sinks some more arrows into [[Omeyani]] before she can escape as [[SIlverskorr]] shifts back into her smaller human form and tries to do the same.
[[Shoko]] having been revived by [[Koya]] is able to stand but not fast enough to chase down the retreating shapeshifter. [[Ochi]] hesitates temporarily over the multiple people bleeding out on the office floor but ultimately gives chase and strikes her another time with his blade and says<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> "Where are you going? We're not done"</mark> and she replies <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"We are done for now."</mark> [[Noe]] catches up as well in a graceful flash. [[Kimmendatsu]] smiles at her seeming to be enjoying this. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Come on now, you haven't been put through the wrenches since what, last time my old man was around here? you'll be fine"</mark> -[[Noe]] <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"It has been some time since i fought opponents who were worthy"</mark> -[[Kimmendatsu]] <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"But you're still losing"</mark> -N <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"Am i losing?"</mark> -K
[[Noe]] brandishes her oni bane wakizashi at [[Kimmendatsu]] who promises all her new friends will die if she uses that on her as he hand coaleseces with ice. [[Noe]] ponders for a long moment before sheathing the weapon and stepping aside. [[Ochi]] does not attempt to stop her either.
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"Good Choice"</mark> -[[Kimmendatsu]]
She takes literal flight and departs. [[Wodes]] accompanies her from the railing
[[Koya]] magically heals [[Shoko]]'s wounds and [[Ochi]] starts checking on those not standing back in the front office primarily [[Omeyani]] as he begins to attempt to save her [[Noe]] approaches and stomps on her neck extinquishing her former masters life.

*<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"I had questions for her"</mark>* - O frowning deeply

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Maybe she could have said somethign to you but frankly I don't know how much of it would have been useful unless you have ways of detecting people who can lie."</mark> - N as she pulls omeyani's clothes back to reveal a lack of a blood geas.

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"Augh, Like i just spent a night in the single worst bar in--- where are we again?, About that bad" </mark>- S
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Well you're still alive so if i may offer a personal insight i'd say you haven't been to the worst bar in Kalsguard Also, you took Oathtaker directly to the face and survived. So I am genuinely impressed"</mark> - N
Ochi passes Shoko a few potions of cure light.

The party then does inventory of the room and bodies finding on omeyani 2 doses of deathblade, 1 dose of black lotus extract, her dagger deadly kiss, 3 earthfire shuriken, 1 +1 flaming burst shuriken, a blowgun with 10 darts, 5 shuriken, masterwork thieves tools, and her garb the Shozoku of the Night Wind. On the others they find fairly expected weapons and armor and not much else. 

Hearing the commotion downstairs but having been too slow to react several more guards from upstairs make their way the the ground floor and upon seeing what they find to be no longer their business quickly and politely depart. 

Ochi turns toward the others as this occurs
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">*"Do we want to hire them?"*</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">*"Do you really want someone who's going to run away at the first sign of a massive violence"* </mark>- N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">*"That's fair. But we do have a habit of picking up people who used to work for those that we just fought and bringing them with us right Noe?"*</mark> - O 
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">*"What?"*</mark> - S Simulatneously <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">*"I Know it terrifies me"*</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"We did that once i wouldn't call that a habit"</mark> - S
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"No, we have the Ulfen Raiders and we have Noe"</mark> - O Smiling
She puts up a single finger. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"To be fair, though You didn't exactly know that until fairly recently and you haven't kicked me out yet. So, I can only assume that you're either putting up with me or plotting to have me thrown in the river by the end of the evening, but I'm hoping for the first one."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Your insider knowledge has been absolutely invaluable. Noe. That's is all I am saying"</mark> - O 
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"It has to be. If I don't tell you, I'm gonna die with it."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well, we have no one to ask any questions of and I think we know where we're headed."</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Not unless you know how to talk to the dead. I'm afraid."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"Are we certain that Ushaka's not here."</mark> - G
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"That is an excellent point Grayson perhaps we should take a better look around."</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"Lets search the building."</mark> - S 

They find a clerk who is still in the building who shares Ukshakas location with them being the room with the boarded up windows. Inside they find her bound and gagged.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"We've been looking everywhere for you."</mark> - O.
She mumbles in response. Ochi frees her. 
"You have my thanks for freeing me." - Ukshaka
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"No, thanks necessary. We desperately need your help."</mark> - O
"Have you found any news of [Ulf]?" - Ukshaka
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"We found zero trace of news of Ulf and we've looked quite a few places dangerous ones at that. Are you well, Did they harm you?"</mark> - O
"Not beyond the beating they gave me to steal me... with many strange large bird men." - U
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Strange how?"</mark> - O
"Well to be fair. They all looked like you, but they were all wearing these black pajamas." - U
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Please don't call them pajamas."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Those are in fashion lately."</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"I need to get some of those too"</mark> - S
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Do you know how many years you need to study before you actually earn a Shozoku?"</mark> - N
Shoko just stares knowingly.
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well Ukshaka I'm not sure how much you know but from things we found here, and various other interactions with our pajama friends, We believe that they're holding our friend and Ulf at Ravenscrag."</mark> -O
"Hmm, I know the way. I could show it to you." - U
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"You would take us there? We could use your help"</mark> - O
"If they have captured Ulf Of course." - U
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well then I think it settled. I think we should make our way there. Maybe we could do some reconnaissance again. These are very very dangerous enemies we are facing"</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"How, how long is the trip there?"</mark> - G
"Two days walk south of Kalsgard toward those grey hills there. One by horse. The way is boggy with shale hillocks. I will take you there and fight with you, for Ulf." - U

party plans and shops.

Sorted. But this is ocher though. I'm sorry. That is mm-hmm. Yeah, that's your. That's your for the rest of the game. You'll never take that off. They literally put that in for anyone that wanted to play a ninja ninja.

You know, that meme of the guy that goes. Yes, I'll die then. Like that's, that's the face. I'm pulling. Looking at that item. I'm like, I don't know what you want me to say Another thing. But what the order lady have honor, you don't get her here quite a lot of spite.

He's arrived. We're gonna have to work a little harder to find out. Right. Yeah, she left with zero damage on her actually. Not saying that she wasn't hit but she was perfectly fine when she left.

Alright, let me since you are selling stuff, I will drop the cows guard selling stats and chat again. That is what is currently available for purchase?

Took old be perfect. How do I add a weapons from my inventory into the combat tab? If you go into the details tab,

And open up. Oh yeah. Where's your star knife? Oh no. Clear. Start knife has missing. If you go into the details tab, you'll see the create a tack down under weapon details.

Um, Okay, I'm dumb. Where is the details tab? Or the item or the tab itself, I guess. For either you have you clicked on edit item on the weapon? Okay, edit item. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. You because you guys gave clear that plus one returning star knives, didn't you?

Here I'm feeling like probably I don't see why we would have kept that. When we know somebody who has a thing, um, shocks are night. I love that. One's the one that turns in the lightning bolt spark weight knife.

Okay, so once Noah goes and basically blitzes down more than half of of what I personally was keeping on retainer 6,151 gold pieces. Do what you want with it.

So you saying must No, that's collectively. If I had that together, I'd be asking, like myself. What the fuck was I doing with all this money? No, that is from selling some off pieces. Oh, and then the 278 is from, what was left on the loot list? Grayson. Yep.

You can find defense for the the black market items in jade quarter. Oh we can. Um then when Noah's done like making antitoxins for those poisons that we have on hand so long, it's just got enough to be able to make the anti-toxins with the rest. We can get sold.

Wouldn't So my shuriken are using my strength to attack? I don't think that's correct. Is it there? He's throwing weapon. You change it? Let me just. No, maybe use your strengths. What?

Oh, well, these are useless to me, then. Yeah, we could probably just sell those to. I have no idea. They went off the strength Only for damage. They still use extra throwing for your attack role. Eggs strength or damage. Okay. For so for attack role, it should be next for attack roll on this.

It's a string just switch it to X. Oh, I'm looking for the ability to do that. I like I'm looking under details. I see attack. Type weapon attack. Natural. Attack, class ability. I'm not saying oh held, I could select which hand it's held in, I put down monk and thrown in weapons group, that didn't change anything.

Okay, so you're still on that tab, scroll? All the way back up to the top. Where it says action, see where it says tech. So while they're discussing at that, what was that total again that we were gonna divide for the deadly kiss? I'm I'm reading it because the number is much higher if I can actually get rid of this poison, okay, once you have the edit item for your attack, open go over to action.

Okay. Now I say, okay. All right, all right.

They're also slamming burst but that doesn't seem to be and damage formula.

26 fire.

On a great 1d and fire.

Um, I'm sorry to be the fucking problem. Child here, I changed action type to range weapon attack and it's not changing it. You can still change it manually to Dex and strength.

Boop. Okay. And delete the old attack you made and create a new one Ebola. Thank you. And I'm sorry, I should know this system better by now. So, every time you make an attack on your combat page, it becomes a separate entity from your inventory page. So if the base item changes, you modify it in your inventory, then create a new attack with it, okay?

Stuff up. And,

And, and hardball.

Monday night himself or half value too. I've never sold anything before, Right? Okay, cool.

How do you guys feel about the anti-toxins?

Poison sock. Oh yeah, it does sound like a good idea.

I'm just saying that if I were An injure in the employee of a clan called the Frozen Shadows. I had myself a little place up on the balcony of some cliffside. I'd probably trap it with an image of his license poison that we go into that. I could get my hand on.

Hypothetically speaking and of course,

And,

Ah, no wrong wand.

Okay, if you want to just decides to inflict wounds on zero out of nowhere, you know?

Is anyone in this group good at um ferritting out traps like that?

Doesn't go acts the group but he looks at no way he does. She have trap finding of what, why do you think I would have Trump finding? That seems like a completely. Ridiculous question. Why would I actively anybody can find transfer that magical trap. You need trap finding And you travel that you see over 20.

So I want to get back to this selling the stuff that no ways doing because I'm confused by it. 21 351. Okay, you just typed it. How about that? So we're all agreement about the the poisons we want to make anti-toxins so we don't die. I think the only one that probably doesn't need them as Grayson which is, I didn't think it was a frink of nature as we've established.

He just drinks it for breakfast. In fact, cursing, can you can you come over here? A minute. I'm gonna fix some of your blood and use it as a basis. No, it So work blood is a basis for is there. Action is the two gonna do? It is the 250 coming off of the 10?

Gonna prevent you do that? No, thanks. Now that's the. That's the that's the actual, like, full with the top antitoxin values. That's all that. That's That's the final value that you guys can go shopping with do what? Okay, so we're splitting the 10. 550 0.5.

Come on. It's just a little nick.

And flex maybe but I found I don't know if I could trust your words. So, Oh, I would recently give the smartest person here, but you're also the one. That's a complete freak of nature. And frankly, I think it's rather fascinating that you're able to resist so many toxins.

So well, So I'm out. Just for the benefit of everyone including Amico in front mid, I'm pretty sure it wasn't even poisoned. It was just a terrible tea, Grayson give the scary ninja lady your blood. It's for everyone. It's for all night. I mean there's a non-zero chance that they might have also used something on the good old scion.

Which, I mean, if I could make some manner of, I'm just saying, don't you want to help your Empressed to be? Ah, no, I'm not a citizen of Tianja so she's not gonna be my empress. Oh, political lines of being drawn. You could be, you could get you could apply for a visa man.

It's not that it's not that hard. I think being chosen as a scion of Ahmadatu Sion actually, grant you citizenship be I get stalked at the fucking border despite being divinely. Chosen, you're gonna have to take that up with the commit at some point and that's not my bag sir, but I will remember that.

You said, no, when next, we have a discussion with the Miss Avatar suits. Sure. Mine with me. So with yourself, I mean he really think aminko would have a problem with him not giving his blood, I don't know. It depends how many they've used on her. If we all die, she might be mad.

But I think at that point, I mean, she has bigger problems. Yes she does. I knew the quick question for you. Sans, will they have any wants or settle here in town? Anyway ones probably I mean they have a spell casting limit of six level and all minor items are available.

Okay. I got some money to spend and I want to get a wand.

So Shoku would actually pull Noah aside at some point and ask her. Um when we're doing this, when we're assaulting your former clan, are you sure? We might have to kill everyone in there. Oh, I'm very much counting on that you do. There's nobody want us to try and set aside.

No one. You want us to try and spare.

She liked stops for him and thanks about it. Takes over glasses and gives him a rub.

Put them back on. I want you to kill them. So thoroughly that Furasma will not recognize their souls when they go for judgment through that kind of people. So, no, I don't want you to save anyone. I may go of course that's kind of the whole point of this But the rest they know what they signed up for Choco nods.

I appreciate that. You ask though really? Yeah.

It's hard thing when we're about to do, but we gotta

So are we just gonna strike out and or what's exactly? The plan. Are we gonna ride all day until we get there? And then just if we write out right now, like how long will it take to get there? You said it. Okay. Now is that like as in a day's travel like eight hours or as in 24 hours of travel They don't really get that specific.

So, a day of writing will probably get you there and or you will arrive there in the morning. Shortly after camping, depending on what you guys want to do. You guys are a little beat up and lacking on spell moment.

So, we could get there, We've backed them into a corner. I would like if we absolutely need to rest we can rest on the way they have Amico and we have them cornered. Yeah, I was just asking whether or not. We wanted to make the assault tonight or in the morning.

I'm not sure attacking and jahid out at night. Time would be the best idea though. It'd be funniest fuck if you did. Not that I'm suggesting it. There's no, I think, but there's also the fact that we'll be camping out in their territory. So we're going to have to set a really good watch.

Well, the benefits is that surrounding terrain near Ravens? Clog is not exactly the most hospitable anyway, So they probably won't have had enough men to feelers out much less trapped the place. I mean it's up on a cliffside, right? Mm-hmm. So, I'm running on the assumption that they don't have enough bodies because we've probably killed most of them at this point.

That's what you said. Ling walked. Late morning, level five. Ninjas still. Yeah, but no, it doesn't have this. I don't know this.

And I'm used to them being like what 15 of them? Maybe. Well, that's a pretty die. Is my die working now. No, it is not. It is still the ugly guy and he's still die. We'll work on it. Hopefully, you should all now have an anti-dops in your inventory.

I clip of Grayson.

How do I reopen the dice customization menu? It's in the chat if you scroll up. Yeah, yeah, I know, but I, I don't know what to spend my money on guys. How much money did we each get from? It's in. No ways. Just shot thing.

Oh, That's a bit more than I was expecting. I did sell up a lot of ignore that five silver. I don't know how I got that. I don't know how you got five field right about. I hope. Um, should be one silver.

I think.

Where the fuck is this thing?

Nice. Think the most useful things that I could possibly, get, are just gonna be these Shoko. Actually scratches this chin for a bit and says, Chloe, you can cast spells that are beyond your ability. If we find you a scroll of it, right? As long as it's something that any that a cleric can do, of course.

I think, Should we maybe confront the idea but these ninja, if they're backed into a corner, might elect to kill Omeko instead of hand her over to us.

And if we pull our money together, we might be able to afford a scroll of a spell to For that contingency.

So you could do that but in the absolute worst case scenario, says, no, I actually mixes her alchemical stuff together in the background you could, but we already have a worst case scenario contingent

That push the glasses up did. Did you guys, Did you guys forget what the seal can do? Oh, I completely forgot what they're looking to do.

Pulls out little notebook. And Now I don't know much about magic but I do know that I think the call me said something about flicks through pages a bit. How do you part of the knowledge on us that it can resurrect people, Alternatively, the shield condensed heel on an Amitatus ion but doing so expenses all of its magical and finally only at the discretion of the seal itself, it can customer resurrection on a Scion but doing so.

Renders its spellpass casting. Powers useless a month. We get one free month. Reset. Yep. Month-long cooldown, Of course, you do have to take it out of the wording box. And that's implies its own problems. I don't recommend it, But I'm not concerned about her being gutted at this point, which I forgot that also which explains why they're keeping her alive because that's better than killing her and leaving her somewhere.

Unless well, if I'm honest, and If I was in their position, if I was conductor, I'd honestly be waiting back for further orders from the five storms before. Actively moving. It's not like it's yes we were created and trained to sniff out Amazatus and other Scions but we're not the ones who have the final say so,

Well, in the case of direct lineage. Anyway, Scions like our good selves or father, I will be right, that I'm suggesting any of you are product. Yeah. Also, looking at our funds, I don't think we'd have the money to get a scroll of raised dead put together even if we all pooled.

Like that's that's an expensive one. We would raise dead. Scroll is including materials is 6,000 something. Oh really. Yep. Breast dad's only fifth the limitation, of course being that you have to raise somebody within days as opposed to, you know, resurrection, which is just whatever I guess.

Piano fancy seal. That's a lot of be able. We would also have to be able to find a cleric capable of casting. It wouldn't we? This is Cal's garage. There are clerics capable of raising the dead. Have you seen? How often people die here? Ah, the highest available spellcasting is six level.

I would scroll or race. That is only a oh, 1,125 gold 6,125 gold then because you need the 5,000 for the material component. I'll be. That's right. I forgot that I except totally doable if you wanted to do that, but We do already have that option in the back pocket.

If yeah, I think it better to prepare for not having to use that then So I guess I guess I will actually go shopping. Oh, I'm back. Back on the town. And while everyone is about it, you will see in the items tab a new book called a couple domain.

You meant in the chats. Well, everyone is shitting and chatting and talking Hoya performs, a little prayer to Desna and all of you can share in her domain abilities.

You can use put a man, granted part. Oh, that's that's really good actually. No, it has no idea what you're doing and hopes that there's now is feeling particularly beneficial today. But, you know, That's neat. Wait, I forgot to actually put the change in there. Speed all speeds plus 10 in the item tab of the buffs tab.

Yeah, on the item tab, it should be down at the very bottom of the buffs page. No of the the compendiums tabs right next to the actor tab. Gotcha. And that could be useful. And just not turn it on travel domain movement.

Okay, it's on.

I'm fast as fuck. Boy the fuck boy? Yep.

And her level. And we're Are you on the items directory? It's next to the older. I'm right? I don't look into the buffs.

Boom. And she has more than enough wisdom and class levels to include all of you. Nuts. Think she just got a wisdom of 21. Yeah.

Which no stuff is. No a familiar with the magic item, the gloves of reconnaissance. Would she be interested in a pair of those? Ah, The plunger has heard of them. No I haven't. She's like I have no idea what those are but they sound fancy. What are they? What do they do?

They let you see through things.

I can't find it. It's being retarded. Please don't use that word. So actors tag at the top, right, to the right of the three little cards, It should be relatively the only item in here at this point.

Yeah, I forgot how long I actually lasts for. Um,

Along what lasts work gloves of reconnaissance? Ah,

It's this is granted me. I think just through the modifier, all of the speeds I have now have 10 foot speed and climb swim burrow and fly the travel domain. Power enhances, all of your movement speeds. If you have them it doesn't give you them. That's what I thought.

I just wanted to point that out that it has it on my sheet. Yeah. You said to all the speeds? Yeah.

Oh, geez. OG just starts flying. No, actually. You do technically have five foot movement, speed, and half your movement. Speed will climbing if you succeed, so it would still increase those speeds but it doesn't provide you like a burrow speed or a fly speed, okay? She dies underground.

Terribly helpful for the fact that are we resting. That is an important question because you're also going to be leveling to six Bruh. Oh no, oh no. Okay. So we are actually going to take our little break here. Well, you guys finish your shopping and leveling and so you lied to get something to drink any more tea.

You lie directly to my face when I said and we level all to six. Yeah, you oh god, right? Okay. It's before you go into Ravens crack though. Well whatever, I'm not. Not gonna look against holes in the mouth. Okay. I mean Amendable also been really high last week and read it wrong.

I don't know. You're fine. That's just one of the point that out that I was like as you live a little to six. All right. Let's Guys, I have third global spouse now. Yeah. Oh I actually might spend some of my money to get scrolled. Put it into my phone book.

That sounds like an awesome idea. I might use the scroll of this palmatic we have and put it in my book. Sure.

Should we not level up yet? Are we all planning on resting before we leave or we planning on resting? When we get closer to there? Can we get a consensus on that given?

I think we're gonna rest when we get closer so that um, that's one vote closer. I vote closer. Abby, I'm down to the rest whenever you guys are good. Like I'm a fucking ninja. I don't give a shit Grayson slash video. Do you guys care? If we do it now or as we get closer, if you're having, I said to level up now.

So I'm just leveling up right now. That's what I was gonna. Okay, Right. Do it.

That's about what I expected. Don't you love getting a one? Yep, I never roll on anything with Lux than a D10. It die because it's just not exciting to get a one on a class that like has a D6. Hit die. Yep, It's funny when you're playing like a barbarian and you get a one and it's, it's incredible when you get a high number.

But it's just like on something that has such a on a D8 or lower. It feels like just take the averages. I have a foundry question for you guys. I've been doing manual health every time, right? Taking the average Do I have to account for my Charisma Boatner, charisma Constitution.

No, it's automatically director, right? Yes, good. I just want to make sure I was like, I could be missing five HP.

Yeah. Okay I got fast light steps. These this thing. Okay. Yeah, I got stupid fucking ninja ability.

All right, so what does level five bar? Get I have a motherfucking key pool. Congratulations on learning how to key.

I'm so excited for this.

I get another spell learned inspire courage. Goes up to plus two like it lore master once per day, but I don't think I do. I think I replace that. Yes, I do. I replace that with.

Wanting refrain.

I need a fear spell.

Oh, we gotta figure out what third level stocks. That prepared. Whichever one perfect back and choose from the pickup. Two free education through the 12.

The Q3 and I've got fireball and lightning version.

That picked up a framework hasted fly. What do you think? Would be more useful.

I mean to good I I don't know. Either could be good.

I feel like cases more, broadly useful, but it would be good to have a way to fly.

That, you know, the extra another arcane exploit and picking up the quick study and Houghton metric explains.

You know, I was joking about it, I might legitimately just take drugs

Blood question is, what do you think? Would be a good? I'm going to pull the trip or take the third level.

It's hard because hasters well, for the whole party, but if we find something that's flying or like, we need flight for something, and it would be good to have at least one way of getting access to it.

You think Gabby a professionally? Did you take quick study? This one, I don't get an exploit until next level. If we are, Is every olive level. Why? Yeah. Okay.

Yeah shit. Um I know what seventh of all I am picking quickly. Yeah. Okay. So generically given that we are going through a fortress. I suspect that we would If we're going to have any problems of flying things, that's going to be in getting cute because I'd hope that, you know the rest of it in the side somewhere.

Um, hasters of a false multiplier, those no way around that. It's powerful spells almost the most powerful spelling, okay? And I,

So,

I mean what were you the options? I take whatever makes sense to you. Like I've been the person who often had one third level slot and I was the only Arcancaster and I said I'm prepping lightning bolt today in the party. Looked at me, I said I'm prepping liking Bolton you punched off me.

Like, well, I've got I have Fireball, lightning bolt just and fly. Those are my options, right? Here's the most widely act likeable one like life. It is functional for everybody upon. I'm not saying that's just of the two weapon fighter sneak attacker it. When you have quick study, you'll be able to use that for, you know, kind of the rest of utilitarian stuff.

Flight, I am less concerned about entirely because Grace and exists.

So that's That's my opinion on that, you can of course, choose whatever you think. Like you want to just choose, it might not be the most option, but it makes sense for your character. So here I'm making a very responsible choice right now, but with that, Alright, double X doing whatever damn time.

We have you seen LA putting a lot of, don't get symbols directly like etching it onto a brush. He's like, don't worry about it. It's fine. It's fine, guys. Don't worry. We're on break right now.

This is not going to be a problem. I think I'll prep hate. I shoot game hiring. I could fireball. But that would hurt party in a way. Guess. We'll just dive it. Like yeah, you choose what you want to Fireball's. Great. Like me, It depends on like what you want to do with your character.

I definitely like I said, being the person who's like, no, Now I'm doing this thing. Figure it out, You've got to have fun too, you know? Where you watching Miss Congeniality. That's a good. I'll figure it out honestly. Don't remember. I'll take. Yeah, so you need a couple times.

It's really good. I remember like seeing that when I was younger, but I don't remember it at all, okay? Yeah, that's that's all right here. But,

Some of these spills are not, there's a weirdly not fear spells when they like, I was paranoia not a fear spell.

Americans are too fat. It made me appreciate white people because only they think it's shit like this. It made me appreciate white people because only they think is stupid shit like this. It made me appreciate white people because I think I speak for all Arizona's when I say to the snowbirds that are coming to Arizona right now drive, Hi, you.

This is our newest and everyday is a dream when I'm carry all carrying to and every day is a dream. When I'm carrying your marble players limited options when wolves and just

I said happened.

Is a terrible thing that men don't talk. And after years, have not been able to

Your car.

Fight through the pain.

Oh, all right. Pick up two new spells. Sweet. Here was him in Greater magic button.

Come on. I think I might apparent preparing heroes and he said, I think that's probably like the most same one right now with your calculator, different.

Birds incredible. Breeding. Well it's rained. The people out some of my money. I have Yeah but the downside of the limited cells may power on. All right. Yeah, and what? I'm down. I'm still I took out almost four thousand, but I know after I really moved up then down.

I've got 38 68 right now.

That is the one thing I don't have with the headband.

Over there, but any return? To him right now, since the bed, pretty much that is kidneys were atrophying. Last time we took a minute, he's on a bunch of meds and now he's got new foods and treats and It's cool. And his kidneys are going. First, I was gonna say he's faking it.

But now that seems insensitive is he's not thinking. He is very good at being dramatic though, but he's quieter about it. The most huskies. He just looks at you really sad with his head down on his paws. It's most huskies are. Very dramatic. Can confirm huskies are generally very dramatic.

My husky is a bit of a drama queen. You're both insane for even having one and my brother's a personal china. It works out and we're moving into a house so much bigger backyard framed to run around in, he doesn't run that much anymore.

With whom everyone finished levels. I believe. So yeah, picked up. I picked up a couple scrolls, by the way. Sans. Okay, third double scroll. So, we can add to my spellbook.

Very good. Are they spells? I need to worry about.

I mean, they're just the ones I picked up were greater magic, weapon heroism Lightning bolt and Fireball. Oh yeah. Unless you're picking up like evil dark forbidden, magics, he trust you to handle all of that bookkeeping. I mean I was thinking of picking him right? A raise of exhaustion, Arab Exhaustion.

I don't know how much. How how helpful that'll be?

Well below me, my new spell sounds evil but it is not technically evil. Uh, That's no. But yeah that. Oh, I need to find a way to apply my bonuses to it, my plus one, two, it being in enchantment DC at my plus two for it being a fear effect, because I'm a dirge board.

Which will crank its DC up to 21, which is quite good for this level. I think. Rich bar.

Yeah, I I was trying to put it in from features, the feature. It's called haunting refrain and it doesn't have it.

And I just remember we talked about like how are we going to make up things like spell focus? Apply to specific types of spells and you said you, it didn't really know What they become context notes in the buffs and so hunting refrain. It doesn't increase your DC. It implies applies a penalty.

So that penalty is actually. I something I would additionally the role saving throws against any fear effects. He creates are made with a minus. Okay. Oh, that means that I will apply a minus two penalty through the opponent's role when they make it. Okay.

Hey, any other level of questions? Now, I'm just testing. The fact I rolled the one for my health.

Crying. He took a risk, I took a risk and was rewarded as I expected. That is That is the life that I need. Unfortunately looks like you and Ochi both or what is that? B6 royalty. I just wanted to look at my cool dice. I got a five. I take manual right?

That's smart. Person over there. I took I took my manual of four on our famous. Yeah, yeah. You've all got more health than me. I got it. I cry over here. It's my I'm just.

Did you guys decide on resting? We are at like four out of five on we rest as we near, okay? I mean I kind of what he said, you know, morning the party, leave the place that way. I've got the smells like if we get ambushed When, Well, I did ask and everybody else chimed in.

But the rest will happen as you approach.

But,

Which is good. That's where we will start off.

Recently, it's not upfront person.

Activate.

It seems like an excellent place to camp for the evening. You have a choke point a clearing.

So and an ocher jelly emerging from beneath the bridge. How fantastic Knowledge Engineering.

Wow. All on red light district today.

I think Shoko knows what it is Yoko. Do know what it is. Open. Boom. So, it is a large ooze. It's vision. Is blindsight. What would you like to know You'll have three questions?

Does it have any special defensive properties? So like any immunitys? Anything that'll happen. If we hit it a certain way, yes, it is. Immune to electricity, mind affecting, it has standard oot straights. It's also immune to slashing and piercing damage. And if it is struck by slashing piercing or electricity damage, it has the defensive ability split in which it becomes two identical jellies.

All right. Shoko will reiterate. That that that don't do those things. It'll make more of them. You in this way. But you will have to split them and then split them and split them and basically split them until they can split no more.

How do they attack? Take time and they generally roll towards you try to grab onto you with their Uzi tentacles and squeeze you onto their acidity bodies. Hmm. And how fast are they not particularly? They have a movement speed of 10 feet.

All right, so Shoko would suggest we pipe this thing and four walks at it until it is. No, he's just gonna sit back and watch this.

Join me on initiative.

Sorry my PC's having a heart attack.

Here, I do. It question for you. How long has it been since? The whole And since we shopped and then we headed out considering this is where you're camping. Probably a good five or six hours. Okay. So, my main camera would be expired at this point, please?

Initiative. And if you

They going dead. Last. It's absolutely in character you and Koya are both going after it actually where we're just back here. Laughing new. You are ever so.

Might help have actually had, you know my tokens are my token selected. It does tend to help.

I'll move to there.

Targeting the boot and then blasting him.

If I can find it, they're

Boom, you sonic blast the jelly reverberates, a great deal. Sending particulates of icker in every direction and that's the end of history. And then it jiggles like Jill, both full of jelly, All right. All right, I don't like that. I don't like looking at it. I don't like thinking about it, he should have ever seen.

Shoko will cast Mirror image and get up in his face.

You know, I get four images. Sweet. Not.

And I will, and my turn.

Sushoco was able to tell us that if we cut this thing, it's a split into what is here? Caster level mirror. This little board. You got five images. Oh, and you get an extra one for every three casser levels you have. Oh. All right. If we slice it, it splits into more or we do a damage threshold, it splits and you slice it, if you pierce it or if you're shock it, it will split into more until we can split.

No, no further. So, I will just use stick and beat it with a stick.

I'm going up. Oh she the whole point of me, putting myself here is that I'm I'm kind of hard to hit with all these and I gestured of my clones a kind of put myself here so that it wouldn't hit you guys.

Okay, I'll stand here and shoot it with a two barrel. I will have drawn that instead.

Oh, yeah. Two barrel that does piercing Ochi OG I just told you. Yeah, I'm gonna stand back here. You got this?

Let's,

You and paste.

That's why you rocks. Rocks there they bludge it. They hear. Oh,

That's all I have for my turn. No, it might be unable to actually act on her tone because she's been struck with hideous. Laughter. Just want you to know this. Oh my goodness.

Oh, shaka charges.

The boom.

I'll go and way less worried about these things.

I had a bad experience with. Once we're a nearly TPKed, the whole party because we thought it if we kept putting it into pieces that like the little pieces might be less powerful. They're not, They don't know, they're not, they just have to help. They hit just desired. You.

That's not people skip him, Grayson.

Grayson, will forward not doing a charge attack secret set, AC still, and we'll just pick out at this is it's done for bro over for this. It's yep. The feeder coming out, like, I hope he doesn't roll high.

He's just lulling it into a false sense. Excuse me, you actually super super hit it. It's easy as for, yeah. It's it's it's it's it is a jello to mold. What? It does not have armor. What I tell no obliters another terrifying. Jill jiggle of ocher jelly before Grayson's foot, appears through the other side of this one.

And I just lumps into the river beneath it. Oh yeah. Get the jelly all over that foot. Oh yeah. Away? What? That just, that just went places. I'm not, I'm done call you. And then he puts his foot in the the river to wash off the You. Oh my god, time.

He tries to murder you. I deserve it. It unfortunately. Misses. Oh, oh yeah. Just looks very confused and no one has any damage. She doesn't want to throw her star knife. So he just how cold uncontrollably next to Nate next. To no way. No nice. Nice for on just no hitting us laughter, you can you didn't know my touch.

She's just there with fucking coil. Like I forgot we in now.

Oh,

I should make an improvised weapon attack.

Oh wait you. That attack. Does pop. One of my images though, gotta be That's it. I'm going to spend a at the Swift action. A mystery AC. So it wouldn't have hit any images as long as it gets within five, it hits an image. Oh, All right so I'm spending our pain point two up.

The caster level of my next felt, okay.

And go ahead and modify that real quick. Yeah. Yeah.

And then I'm then I'm going to cast on the one in front of Shoko, scorching ray

I'm loving the amount of dice we're seeing on screen now. This makes me happy. This. Yes, I like this. It's good stuff. Oh close, but not quite

And that's the end of my turn. Oh, shoko and I just strike it with the bomber of my weapon. Can that be like an improvised weapon attack? You got throw rocks, you get a little rocks. Well like I mean the palm oil is like a blunt object. It's so like it's oh yeah we get it.

Well, let's just do a regular attack for improvised weapon.

I think it's a minus two and release. That's not helping it would just do. Look, you want to do when the three budgeting damage on with my strength? I wouldn't do anything. So, I guess, Shoko will take the total defective action. Whoo. Okay. Okay. Now, I'm gonna run up to it and hit it with a stick.

Boom Unfortunately can't be crit but you do kill it. And it also ripples verbals and then balls down into the river and washes. Hey. And then OG's gonna take his double walking stick katana and just rub it on the grass to get the the juice off it. I guess, Shoko will check under the bridge real quick to make sure there's not more of them.

There's 50 more of them, the 15. There's a lot of moves under one branch.

Man that thing really like jiggled, I don't, I don't think I've ever watched people. And so I look towards a fucking pudding. I it ever seen anyone, Oh, Jelly and be like, violence OG runs up. There's like I hate tapioca and just smacks it with this stick.

Oh, Crown me and take me to hey fang. I'm dead. Well, it might look funny but you haven't seen what happens when those things get there. Yeah, and I pseudopods tentacles, I don't know what you'd call them. He?

Video. Just shakes his head muddenly wherever I got myself into. Nice kick Grayson. You get around the course us laughing. So hard at this ooze. Is, how is how we get up? Fucking super big CR ooze? And the actual dungeon, Like, what's a really scary? One, like a black pudding or something like pudding.

Bring it? No, no. Because it's you scariest. Um, who's I have ever seen is one that I not has a gravitational pull? What that ones for it? Can fly Plasma mode. My breath. You've experienced the hell. That is the plasma as I see. Yeah. As you know, fucking hell that room.

All I could I joined that group and in person group joined it for a little while until the campaign fell apart because you know random things happen and people couldn't come to give me kind of work. Schedules usual. Yeah.

And we were keeping eight at the plasma news. Yeah. So did we? We lost a we lost a player and it was the first place where I couldn't cast disintegrate. I was like, oh Oh, this is problematic. But yeah. Um, well done on fighting a giant mass of tofu I'm impressed.

I I try to stay humble but one with opponents like that I can't help but feel my ego and played a little And OG being right next. To no way. Just elbows are in his like, what did I tell? You. Look at those kicks. Oh yeah. No fucking terrifying.

Grayson remind me again. Where did you learn? How to do that.

Uh, no need to remind you. I never told you in the first place. Yeah, that was kind of the hint. I was gonna be, you know, like decent about it. But No seriously. Like what? What school are you from? I learned it in my McClain holds and then a lot of practicing with chilela.

Yeah. Oh, and traustin double heard of Dwarven-based martial art extense, you know? I just expected. It would be more, She makes a motion as if to like at the distance that you're away from how she kind of, like, rounds your outline and then almost picks. It open. Throws it.

I was expecting more that from From tour even much love.

I gotta say what. The. So, with my engineering, check what I know, like the usual habitat of Anoka jelly, like is it odd that we found one out here in the wilderness in the colds? They don't particularly need warm temperatures, but this is not its normal habitat. No, like under a bridges, not usually where they hide.

Mmm, I think I think that might have been a surprise left for us by the shadows. Then in which case, if this is their idea of a trap, then, no, I don't think we have much to worry about from their trappings of the castle. No. It's just, I'm, I'm trying to mentally visualize Kim and Dotsu Luring that thing into our path.

And honestly, that's gonna let me dream so peacefully tonight. Speaking of we'd better get some rest, let's get camp. Set up. Look shot goes, like already said a fire and shit. While you guys were talking,

He was being castic presentation on people that were up front. You know, beating it. Beating it up.

Oh, just he'll get. He'll go get some firewoods.

Yeah, you guys want to do anything while you're camping?

I guess just check like the the sort of immediate area around like has this road been used? Like recently, Is there any Well Ash? Okay, it does look like it's been used very recently. Let's see. But then only yogurt because she can fly. Yeah, yeah. I figured that's, but they're very large bird, footprints on this road, and normal human footprints and try.

Speaking of birds, uh if we're within a mile of the of the fortress then I could ask the local bird population. One question. Ask away. Well, what do you think? I should ask. It'd have to be something that birds would know.

I mean does that count as your one question?

What? Oh, you get it. I just give a moment. I was gonna let it lay there Grayson. I was just leaving it alone. I was like, nope. Nope, that's fine. Yes, you see? No, I take out like this bar and configure it into. It's a traveler's, any tool, and like configures it into a shovel.

And it's just like and you help me just make my own grave right now. Just this is what I want to remember. As I go to Harasma, I should have let the jelly. Eat all of you.

But justice was swift. My good friend If not necessarily delicious. Okay. Oh, geez. Swift. I think I have let's see. Survival right for tracks to follow them or like know about them, because I'd like to roll on the tracks a little bit. Oh, they are Tengu tracks but like I was I was gonna try and use survival to determine the number and how long ago, the people and the Tangu came through here.

All right, I don't know what difficulty that is or if that's in the realm. What I rival rule. I mean, once I stopped like rolling on the ground, laughing get a plus two, which I'll help you out a 15 then. Um, less than 30 more than 15 individual tracks that you can pick out.

That's a good number. We should definitely set watches tonight.

I don't closer until we've had some rest.

So can we set up a camp and do a rest? I think I noticed the I can ask the birds. Oh, Oh no Shoko will cast commune with birds. I'll throw it up here.

Um, and I'll go with a asking the local birds. If the humans dressed and black, do they prowl the wilds tonight? Looking for prey? Or are they hold up in their nest? That's two questions.

I know the other I think it's A or B. So all right. Do they in a mile? Give me just one moment cuz there's very specific birds. And then Fred who's not that far away. It's like, oh no, we're coming after you tonight.

As you cast the spell, after you've kept the spell, Hundreds of hundreds of ravens. Come swirling about you, Oh no.

And they tell you, yes, you are being hunted. Oh, she walks up to Shoko and says hey man. Can you never do that again? You would be hunted. Now, if our master knew you called us, They know, they know they know oh she's gonna hit this one with a stick.

You would you exactly Ravensworm? Don't attack them. Oh she's like halfway through his way. Not a good idea. Oh geez halfway through his swing with the stick and stops. He's just gonna like, do a little jab poke. And he's like, all right and he doesn't because he kind of he doesn't think about it as first and then he does look around and look at the number of him and it's like maybe not

But yes, the general. They tell you that you are being hunted.

I want one. I think you see the little eyeballs we had in their mouths. Yes, yes, I did.

Your cousins are weird, don't you? So are yours a congratulations. You get pre-warning that there are raven, swarms in Raven's Craig, there. I think we have to be. I can't imagine there's a I can't imagine there's a lot of parties that do that specifically and try and commune with birds and then the Ravens forms.

Like oh yeah, we're gonna get you, man.

I mean, probably not Good to know though. Oh, just gonna go back to get firewood. The two times I've used that spell. I have not expected the outcomes. I think that might BYOT is so keen on. You not repeating the effort.

I personally think should keep doing it. It's quite interesting and frankly, useful information it positives to our collective health.

So let's roll up a rest question, mark. Oh, you would like to. There's a lot more RP at this little campaign expected. I think we should set a watch in Paris tonight. Indeed to shoko have dark vision. I need to check. I'm gonna hit rest. You, I don't know.

I'm Christian I don't think he does no.

Well, I know Now I would volunteer for like the second shift. Anyway, because I mean, it's darkness, of course, I'm gonna volunteer for the second shift. I'll go for the, what would be a third shift towards the end towards the dawn?

Okie dokie. We should probably just set up like a standard one at this point. And just real like here,

That's a really good point. Yeah. Shoko will take first. Watch, Grayson can take third.

Right. This.

Spinach loading, I don't know. Even take a watch.

As a cluster, who requires a certain amount of rest, I don't know how that deal works. Few.

I need you the cycle that, like we, we sleep for 10 hours overall to make up for the fact that people are up for two.

Something like that.

All right, who is on third? Watch Third watch is myself and Grayson. I believe.

Here.

Imagine realize like a cast. A couple spells women. No, if we get attacked in the middle of the night then we're kind of screwed. Like we that uses up that wastes our rest only if you can't spells, okay. That's a house roll. But I am stealing that house or electrically.

That's well it's it's a bit more. It's, it's more leeway than normal if you don't engage in the combat and you let your party handle it and you just keep killing over there. You can be woken in the middle of a rest and still go back to sleep.

Yeah. It doesn't have to be continuous like it, like, it has to be eight hours of rest. But you can like if you get if you have four hours and then you get into rupted and do whatever certain classes that fox some other Most classes, though. So your classic wizard sort of are just like, okay, I need to continue my rest as long as you haven't done anything extremely exerting, which casting a spell out I would actually.

So yeah, I mean, I could just, I could just, you know, Flash them with an arcane X with my Sonic plots. If needed, that's not really getting as felt That is still an exertion like you spending plasma points. It's what a supernatural ability. Yeah, So it's not an extraordinary ability, so it's not like super innate.

It's still an explosion of power.

But resuming Perception. Checks for me, please.

Here comes a 35 from Grayson.

All right, Grayson

You see a pair of birdie footprints appear in the snow, my hair than my ping working.

Well then, let me reload.

You guys come here, often.

Pardon. Oh, that might be why I started lagging suddenly, Netflix was playing.

Mmm.

You see some 30 footprints appear in the snow right over here? And at the same time You hear a twig snap over here. Only crazy only Grace. And here's this. No, he actually beat two of the ones with higher stealth roles. You will only beat one of them.

Who appears in the snow right here, just their footprints. So, you guys Grayson sing, where these two are OSG seeing where this one is, as well as Grayson. He also sees the other well, so much for only the higher ups knowing how to turn invisible. I never said that.

I said if they are are taking their time like sneaking towards us. They are Grayson wants to get just like a big handful of snow and just like toss it in this space where he sees the footsteps behind it. They use it like like flour or something to coat and invisible person.

I see what you're going for there and I will let that work for the round. You hit them after that. The snow will either melt or become invisible with them.

You, If you would make a range attack for me against touch AC

Very nice higher low worth it. Hi.

The Tango narrowly evades. The snow. You see part of it brush. What? Looks like an arm. I would improved precise shot have any effect on that.

That have any effect on concealment. It's tall concealment so which is what invisibility provides.

Let me nor easy bonus, granted by targets of anything less than total cover and the mischance granted by targets it by anything less than total concealment. So not quite. I didn't know they made improved versions of precise shot. Oh yeah. I'm precise is amazing because otherwise you end up taking like negatives.

Every time you try and fire at someone through a doorway? Yeah, that's fair. So unfortunately. No, because they are getting total concealment. Okay. I I don't know how we're going to fight for invisible enemies. They're not it's not greater invisible. You don't know it. That's fair. I'm not helpful.

I'm gonna be. So I'm the sound of combat. Wake the rest of us up. I mean, we haven't gone into initiative yet and he was like he saw before. I'm gonna say with his better perception role. I think that Grayson saw these things happening before OG did. But we haven't like I was gonna whistle first thing.

Why are your initial go private?

Oh, should we write it and ochi you both get to accent in the surprise rounds? Should we all know you guys rolling it?

Okay, and then after we do this round we will bring in everyone else. Basin. What would you like to do? Christian will show out loud that there's an ambush and, and gosh, I yes. Trying to shoot at the one that he threw Snow at it. You get one attack because of the surprise around.

That's okay, you're busy trying to wake everyone up, everyone perception. Minus 10, please.

Everyone. Well, everyone who's asleep?

Okay. I but I only needed a five. You're good. No, no. That's before the minus 10. Oh, you are sleeping quite soundly this evening.

No, no. He's immediately awake. You just see like, jackknife, I won't.

In boom. All right. No way, Koya.

Option.

Look shaka. Right, you guys all wake up. You will get to join combat next round. Nope. Nope. So, does he wake up to? It's the only needed if

Boom. Oh, gee, rapping bird feed up here in the sand or in the snow before you Here before me. Yes. Okay. A 14. It's your flat footed. AC, it does not the boom and while he appears his form is still blurred,

Shoko a 23 to hit your butt. Put it AC. I mean considering I'm unconscious, isn't this? Like an automatic crit. No, he had to move 10 feet.

He needs a full round of insta kill. Yes, all right. Well then I assumed this wakes me up. Yes, this will very much. Wake you up? Just a gentle stabbing to wake you up in the morning. Oh, I'm fixing their. We get back for some reason, it broken.

Okay, I have to change these dies since they are very cool looking but they are bogging me down.

Thing. Good ninja. Boom, charges the dwarf.

But around 15, I get your blood-footed.

Sorry for my computer, even just check it. Miss. Yay. The upper class assassins are doing great. Let's see here. So this is a meta question is grappling worthless. If I haven't invested into it, because I don't know, I guess I could make a knowledge. Check to see if they may disappear again, but I really want to know where they are so that other people can beat the heck out of them.

So I'd love to like, grab him and hold him As part of your getting the FYI, from Noah, she would have told you if you're in a situation where you can't see and ninja grab a hold of them and then beat the shit out of them if you can.

That's what I thought. So I think that is what I'm going to go for. Can I don't have the relevant knowledge to know more about the frozen shadows tangu specifically right? I don't get to do that. Uh, no. That's what I thought. That's okay. So we'll How do I make a CMB check?

Here it is. I'm gonna try and grab all the tangu right next to me.

Go for it. I'm gonna say that's a no. That is definitely a no. Yeah, so Ochi whiffs trying to hug this guy.

And then he cries if any crime.

Bringing us to our next Tango. Ninja just crazy wake up.

Is that that's what you.

Removed and go ninja Quit.

The circuit. Oh, my, yeah. That's, that's, yeah. That's, that's that. That's can that's a hit. And I confirm, oh,

And hit that where I put it also, you know, sneak attack. Mastering it. Just roll its character sheet.

Five points of sneak attack. It's gonna be very pissed off. Hi. And now everyone joining initiative and everyone's awake.

Oh, that one did that one day that, you know kind of hit me.

Did he end up? You know, becoming visible. Oh yes.

That everyone, Nope, still Luke Shaka.

Alright, Top of the round, Grayson

Chris is just going to point blank, shoot, the one right next to him with the gear.

Of my you. It's it's oh there's a miss and he's dead.

Whoopa.

Picked him for no reasons it. That was Shoko. That was so much damage.

Shoko will. That was 60 damage. Take out his weapon and look up at the sky and say that's rollerblers and I will make a defensive casting cat. Check, I succeed for mine. The blurs wouldn't have matter because I got the improved say improve the shot. Oh, that's very useful.

Good. There's a reason. It's BAB allowances. Normally 11 by touching creature. What's up related instrument, you call the creatures flesh to loosen and slide against you, okay? And roles that check for me.

Is there just why isn't there just a button to roll base attacks like this? I guess. I'll have to calculate it. So nope. There. There is it right? Click your token under your dropdown menu on the attack tab, you'll have your regular melee range.

Just you and we jump to the stone, I'm gonna fix it.

Standard touch.

Actually amazing spell attack ability dexterity animated formula. Boom Next 5. What kind of damage do you just untied damage, huh? That's very what kind of type, what kind of damage would you call that? Boom, 10. A lot of pain fortitude, it's not offset.

And and let's see if that worked. What's that?

But I probably miss with an 11.

Yeah, you get a bonus to range attacks while you're probably not mainly but you are still holding those nutshell.

I guess I'm staying prone because I don't want to provoke an attack by getting up seems fair. Boom, bringing us to Koya. Um,

Boom. Wholesale her wand and CEO with it. A really bad role. That's a okay, that's a little about wrong. All right.

Look, shaka does stand up Drawing her weapons that she does.

People looking.

Bring up the new way to steps. Thank you again. Steps off from being prone drawing, one of the lockizes and then uses a 5 foot to go here. And then vanishes,

Because I am, I am definitely in a light level lower than normal, right? Yes. Yeah. So this shizoku just like fades out and then so does the rest of her.

And that, that is my time because I can't do much else. Boom, the tango looks in your direction things to step back.

And pulls out a boat blue gun. Not unlike ochis.

The okay below gun? Or the thing, the Ochi has on his character sheet because I don't have a blowgun, it's a blue gun. Okay. I was like, he better not. Yeah, not a two barrel. Shoot, not a two-barrow shooter. Sorry. Well I also have a different tube thingy that I never use many tubes.

Why like so many tubes?

Oh, geez actually played by Lizzo. So, he plays the flute. This makes a lot. Boom, this thing. You continues trying to stab you with his wakazashi. There is not have haste. They're mr. Proman. Oh my all. It doesn't confirm, that's good. Boom. Do I have to make another saved to keep as well?

No, it's already cast. Okay, it's just in your hand, you release the charge. How did I get that health? Did I get healed at some point?

No. Huh. Because morning I put down that I took that damage, right? Let me just scroll back up to it. It was seven damage and a 9 precisions equals, right? So, 25 damage Soko's bloodied.

You were in a lot worse shape than I thought. You were Leo, Mia will stand up, which will provoke

A game next to him.

Yeah, that's gonna hit all right. One second guys.

Interesting.

Please resume. All right, so then he put and then, while he stands up, he pulls out his, his mate. And he's gonna try and beat the shit out of the IDEX to him.

He's good.

Actually hits. And that is almost half as health.

That is the end of his third.

The first time he's pulled out that mace.

Y'all got maces? Yeah, he's had a mace. He's gonna meet stand across club.

I mean yeah. That makes sense. But like No, it's just like you can swing without them.

Apparent. You take the guys kneecap off. Apparently, you can noted.

Oh, right? I mean he's not very not very amazing at the springs, but he's there. Cranking us to weigh-ins turn.

That was not way yet, Are you sorry? I was just clicking around on my sheet. Oh,

And indeed, not actually be there.

Single attack. Oh, this is 16 and fortunately.

The end go there.

A tiny creatures. The way in is in his space. Oh gee. Okay. After having failed to get this boy last time with a hug, he's going to move. Like so drawing his weapons as he does and making an acrobatics to avoid the attacks of opportunity. He's holding a blue gun.

This other guy he can make it exactly.

I think you are good. You weren't the most grateful Tengu on the map. He's gonna swing at the guy, he tried to hug. And it's just a regular one, shouldn't need anything else, a one swing? That hits and he's gonna say. Where do you think you're going? Stay and fight me.

And that'll be OT stern.

Bringing into singing Newton.

Who continues his orders to try and kill the wizard?

It only Here, I really thought he would try and stab me one time. He does take a step back though.

15 hit and in 19 it. Yeah. Both of those with him. Horton. One is the first one though.

Roll fortitude for me, please. Love what?

One point of Constitution damage. Ah, lovely.

And it'll go by. I'm sure Zeo's Constitutions really high, so it won't matter.

You, I go here and then I'm gonna go here.

And the helmet flies up and tries to headbut the Sangu in the back of the head, not doing well.

With his minus four strength. I gotta pick his breath. Weapon. Grayson going to shoot at the one. He's got selected. So, the one that was attacking zero,

He great rules is obliterated. No. This one over here. Yeah. Okay 13 misses the 25. Hits for 15. The 16 hits for another 13 that drop him.

The second one. Not go through. It drops him alive. Even all in one, all of these assassins should have been trying to go. I mean, didn't I do 10 point to damage you should? I did almost half his health. He did. I was so when he did took another 26, I was like fighting.

He, but one of the must not have gone through Shoko. Heck. Yeah. In the Tangu, should both have been trying to come.

Well, this time I will Try to hit again.

A. All right. Now, you actually that fortune safe up to that.

Ready to go.

There we go. Fourtitude tape. Oh my god. Finally.

Then Shoko will stand up because he is now staggered. Which re-key cannot take a ops. Well, why is he taking 17 damage as it also does? Oh, that only place to another creature. Never mind. Now, apologize because not said anything.

That good. Oh well, to be fair, you touch him.

We didn't just we're not prepared for Grayson. We didn't roll that concealment on my attack, on this guy.

Oh, that's fair. He still would have dropped. And this guy hasn't been hit yet. I poked in one time Did you poke him? I thought you poked the other dude, I had this one targeted.

All right, chuckle, get up pick up his shields and and turn somewhere.

You did you did seven points damage to him. Apologies. I did not apply the damage. That's okay. But again, we have to roll the percentage for it if he's got blurred going.

You hit him?

Show go. This is for you.

He is regretting the purchase of this one. It is not serving her well so far.

Oh, shaka. This kit one? Nope. Nope. No five foot step here.

Let's do single attack.

Slim and then long sort mind.

Up over attack. Boom. She is just beating the fuck out of that tengu with her shield and sword. No way he's making parable squawking. Noises amazingly Ms. Chances.

They're blur has done nothing for them and maybe maybe a little of done something at some point.

Can I say invisible things and they you don't know. Well no they can't. You're about to attack. No it seems completely unaware of you. Thank you. I mean I mean he looks like he knows he went invisible and that you might be a threat to him but it's not like he's tracking your movements and at the same time he's getting slammed in the face with the old.

Yep. That's and then you murder him. Oh no. Yeah, just you guys at the front, just see a sword just appear through his chest. Just sup? It's pretty bad, not bad. Yeah, he drops. Um, so this homie can only take a move action or standard action and thus tries to move away.

Working attacks opportunity from Shoko who is now standing algebraval and the monkey Monkey Pirates.

One level.

Pockets sneak attacks. Not working. Either, Why is think that broken on all these guys. So you see the monkey bite into his ankle and rip out his achilles tendon.

By time flavoring that one non-lethal damage he rips out his Achilles tendon. There was this thick, sneak attack damage that it. Oh Nick, I'm gonna switch to doing non-lethal, that's really brutal. Yeah no it's not the non-lethal they they have a racial sneak attack die, he dead legs in but in the calf he like punches him.

Yeah. Did the back of the leg. That's, that's probably much more accurate. It does have two slam attacks as well, the boom city.

Look at why he's thinking to text messed up later Shoko. You get an attack of opportunity. Is trying to flee.

Yeah, yeah, I will absolutely take that attack.

I think I'll try and trip him because I don't I since I have my shield up, I won't be able to do a need real damage. And no, This is the art. I found for them by the way, forgot.

I will unfortunately fail to strip him So I'm 10 15.

25. 30, it cannot take the withdrawal actions. The only moving him. His movement speed did algevolt, take an AOL on it as well. Oh, he did not. I forgot. Thank you for the reminder. Boom, I just want to watch the world bird. It's he fails. Mainly is not his strong suit.

Deo. Some seal will part his wand of magic missile. Yeah, no, dude.

And just see how pulls out, as one. Normally people have to pay for that. Got David happy. So, Lily, target the dude with his wand. All three missiles.

He's just trying to go home.

Oh, I think I gotta make out of portages save, right? Yes. Or we've done around. Okay. Okay, here, I will link it again for you.

We gotta roll the damage again. Anyways, least. You're getting minimum damage. Yay, One more successful. Save and you were free of this late poison that they each have dose of

Well, this thing is that played was on the first start. He fired. Boom. So, there's a dart by the way, with death blade extract, like somewhere in this general area because he missed OG with it.

I mean, it's not very hard to hit me when I don't have HR and stuff.

Oh, I thought I hit interned. I take it that dude stall. I've he is, in fact still alive.

Way and moves right here.

What?

Okay, put it like this.

And clips it. With an arrow are with a dagger with a tiny dagger.

And just love effect, he created on it with it, the dagger hits him square in the back of the head.

He?

Okay.

That's not what I wanted to do, or you sure about that.

Can I make it that far? That's what I was trying to measure. I don't know if it's subtracted it from my movement but I have 50. Yeah, you can easily make it that part.

Yeah, we're gonna go like right there and I'll roll acrobatics if you wants to be spicy about. He is still staggered and ochi will.

He's gonna try and non-lethal him. He's already got it. Bunch of non-lethal. Oh, do they not? I can't just add the non-lethal on top of the lethal and knocking below. You can you can just choose to do not only full damage. I mean, he already has loan people because the monkey has been hitting him.

Yeah. Do I take a minus for doing so with my weapons? I'm pretty no. We're using elephant in the room. You just can't crit with only people. Okay. So I'll roll. Regular attack. That sounds great.

God damn it. That didn't work. Like I wanted it to wait, the fuck, is that? Because critical confirmation. I tried to add a role at the beginning. Like I saw Zeo had for against concealment and it took it as my attack roll. That's not a concealment thing. Magic missile just hits.

Yeah, it just does that because it sucks let me. I'll just take that modifier off and swing again and we'll see what it actually was.

Is that better? It is an unfortunate miss but it is better. Okay, fix that thing.

That's about all I can do by the way. You like, well I still have and here Reth Weapon. That's he is well in hand. Grayson. Well, Are we trying to capture this one alive? I was just gonna see like oh man, he didn't have the blood geos. So I was hoping maybe these tango a little bit higher ranked and they didn't either and we could ask them about Ravens crag a little bit.

If is it the one that's still staggered? Yeah, then you should be able to catch him fairly easily. What they've already caught him. Okay, he did not get very far because if I if I shoot at him it's gonna be lethal damage. You do what? You don't got to do, Grayson.

Well, since you guys seem to want to catch them all just I just won't do anything.

A shoko just to be clear like you see Ochi swinging at him you have dark vision so you can see that he's like hitting them with the flat of the blade but he didn't say anything. He's not like don't kill him. Yeah, she'll go will attempt to catch up with you guys.

So if it'll let me move. Oh okay, okay foundry. Yeah, sure that's what I wanted. And that, okay, it has clipped to me out of bounds like, no longer reenter that

These windows.

I cannot see that, I only, so,

I guess Shoko will swing wildly at the air in front of him because he remembers. That's where the dude was and I'll try and do this non-lethally.

Okay up. So, not being able to see him and not only post about to 20 to hit then because we're minus 4 for being on lethal. You just can't create. Oh, okay. Which he already had three long lethal. He's got 11 HP left. He balls uncontives.

And that is everyone either dead dying or unconscious. Sochi will grab this guy and pick him up and fireman's. Carry him back over here to the fire where we can all see and he run away so easily. So since we started at 10, it's It's been four and a half hours.

Do you think we could call it there started at 11?

So we were gonna wrap up after this fight in questioning, Are you okay? Thanks sticking around for that.

You can I I kind of gotta go. Yeah, it's all good. It happens. The questioning doesn't go particularly far. Anyways, these ninja all do have the blood gears on them.

But these ones have much better gear than the last ones and I got to make a couple more four distances if you do, let me drop that in the chat again for you. So, round three.

I failed that one Another point of con damage, Round four. And this isn't one the exact reason why? No way. Yeah, anti-talk them. I was nowhere, is probably like, looking over the moment that she realizes that this poison on. Was it the blades or the belt or something? All right, yeah, so at the start of like the next one, the moment you kind of like cough a bit and you know it's obvious that you got hit by a dart.

She just comes over, pulls out. It pulls out of vial guys. Next week I got I gotta take off. Thank you. And yeah, just shows one of the anti-toxins down your throat. Just like stop being a pussy. Come on. That's mean we're at negative three or three con damage so far Round forward.

You gotta plus five to all subsequent attempts. Mm-hmm. And you make one more, save You need to make two. Is it two steps or two? Concurrent saves it. Just says, two saves. Not too concurrent. Thank God. Let me double check. I think it might be consecutive. I think it's consecutive It's probably consecutive since that's what everything else is.

Oh two more points. Two consecutive saves. Yes, it is. Okay, after I've got one way over for around acquired doesn't have neutralized poison but she has restoration. Lesser got my help and she hasn't prepared even

All right. Last one. You. All right, you

Yet for max condoms. The only thing that Noah can kind of suggest at this point is like, okay, so you're probably gonna want to stem the wound somehow and actually in her bag of tricks, as usual pulls out a bunch of other vials and it's like the problem is I'm not a surgeon.

I don't know how to fucking do that. Which is my way of saying, is anyone in the party, actually good at heal. Give me like just tosses it over. Take you take A plus 3 to your heel track. If you use the jawed from methadone skit, I got this in case I stabbed myself in the eye, go call you go alone.

All right, so for a night of rest, you are going to double your gain back. 22, We will get. You have three potions of lesser or sorry. Three scrolls of lesser restorations. Do you? Yes, we do. Let give those two koia then and she can use those cut. Oh my god.

This is bad. Yeah. Now, imagine if only Yanni had actually hit with any of her, a tags. Yeah, yeah. It's all of her weapons were coded with desk blade.

This is part of the reason why I know I get to be annoyed when Grayson's, like, oh, who gives gets down about poison? It's like you were fucking freak. You know, Yanni really should have been a much more challenging battle. He just wasn't for you guys's group because she didn't get Oh damn okay so that's four back on the first scroll.

I think you were minus six. I would like minus eight. Oh my word and there's the light but the last four I needed goddamn koia with your restoration scrolls. So, I'm gonna take it, we're taking the wand back, but keeping the scrolls and finding out who provided those and putting them on the billing.

Yes, we have them. Those are party inventory. Those are actually a party inventory. Oh, impressively done! Yeah, he's been casually. I think you guys got those in brainwall. Yes, Good always good. Keep them around. Always useful. So with zero, now dying we try and tie up and wake at the tango up, check in for the blood geos.

See that? It's there and then wake him up and ask him a question and watch him die. Anyways, that is pretty much how that will go. Yes. Yeah.

Well that's fun. Is that though? Not the word I'd use personally. Gonna say a prayer over these fools to Hey, Fang. Mmm, you wanna actually give presents to their own. God, might I suggest Yazang. It's not for them. It's for me for my conscience. Oh, that thing. Nah, you didn't and no, I will actually like move the corpsos back to the tree line and like get them out of the way.

Because there was a little bit of sarcasm, it was for them but he just does whatever God. Yeah, he thinks is appropriate and I think it seems like anyone was it. Allow super, I'll shoot up the patron for. Thank you is, hey fang? I'm pretty sure. Oh, I genuinely don't not and probably neither would know it.

You've dropped it multiple times of like that sick and now you're like, yeah, but that doesn't mean. She knows much about like how the culture actually functions. Yeah. He's the a tengu worship. A thing primarily. Don't this working like no, I wouldn't know that he's an if I'm remembering correctly.

He's a type of Oni. I think. Oh no, much more about that. He's represented as a Tangu. He's like the god of story. He's represented as a yama. Bushi tango. What is anonym? Yeah, which is one, I would not and like anything. Beyond that is like fully completely beyond her.

That is a cultural like the thing that she'd be like, huh.

Honestly, I'll never known as the the angry champion of storms. Yes. But always sounded really cool. The Duke of Thunder. Yeah, agree. No.

So, let's lose their bodies.

Very used to and some days. Sorry, I was fixing how hungerville's breath weapon and weigh in sneak attack. You're fine. I'm gonna talk show. Go in to bed rest. Now old man. You did good.

He goes to bed. He is told to go zero you alright, will you be? Well, I'll be fine. Yeah, Meanwhile, he so yeah, on the break of the oldest is over here, taking shots of vodka.

Didn't I didn't want to actually cast something he did. He's got a, he's got to get a full night's sleep now.

Did he cuss it always in his with them? No, he know. He casts. Yeah, he cast on my plush. See also Preakiest fucking shit I've ever seen. So today's meter day are all of their weapons. Poisoned like that, that was terrifying. Zeo almost died in a matter of a minute.

And we now understanding why I said antitoxin this useful, not all of them, they only had one dose so it was just on their first dart from their blowgun but now knowing like he's just commenting on it. Like that was, that's scary. I didn't realize, you know what I mean.

He's realizing like how dangerous these fights he's been and have been and he's like coil, let me get some of that. Vodka. Yo, this 17 year old is like ma'am. If I might and or except for the desk blade, there's only two doses of that. But everything else is time for and mmm.

Unless anyone stops her know, I just like I assume they're in the dots, the sort of sock expose Talks them into a. They are all loaded up and ready to be used. Took them to the inside of her hairy.

Yes, terrible things. Definitely a crime against all living. You know, man and humanity old bird or looks at zero again thing.

Read sign, what? Sorry, the crime and the entity. It's crime. Okay, you So Z what I think that you're terrible. That was terrible. That's okay.

Also gonna heal her friend while he's sleeping. Oh, I'm sure the old man will be And not being said, though, just to avoid that happening quite so badly again. Oh, cheer, you by any chance? Using a necklace of any kind. I don't think I have an X-lot. Oh yeah.

I have the armor natural armor. Oh yeah, that's probably gonna be less useful to you. Then. I mean, I'm open to it especially if I'm gonna be fighting in the front like, you know, run it by me in character because all I was gonna do is that like you remember the actually, remember your character seen it?

Probably when we were in the, the rhymers and like, no. I ripped something off of her collar and just smashed it and the charm. Yeah. There is three currently on her neck and she just pulls one of the leather chords off and throws it at you. Oh yeah, definitely.

What is it a links something charm? Yeah, it's a link sidecharm. I'll I'll put on the I'll just gift it to you in a sec for sure. Thank you. You only get to use it the once, unfortunately. Yeah, I got the tattoo and I can detect, but I feel like a lot of this is just gonna be surprised around stuff anyways, so I can detect magic for illusion if we think we're being followed somewhere, but I can't wait, you know, insta?

See invisibility or anything? Hmm. Well, I can do a couple other things, but the most important one really is gonna be that, that particular kind of divining. Yeah.

So if I might get this to you, you should hopefully not have a link sidecharm. I'm sure I do. I'll go look.

Like this. Fixed anyone have anything broken. That needs fixing think all my stuff. Everyone got your new classabilities and stuff. Added just fine. Yeah, no way. When you leveled up any ninja levels, did it automatically add like ninja trick for you or you going and selecting them as you level up, because it didn't give it to me.

And I went, and you, you have, you have to manually go in and add the trick as you. I just want to make sure I did. I didn't use any this level so far but I was like, hmm. You should be able to find most of them in the features compendium.

They did. I just was like, looking through almost like it didn't doesn't say ninja trick anywhere here. So I didn't know how. Yeah, you just, you know what I mean? Like for the the warrior poet, like the things you can select like every odd level like it doesn't have those automatically either so I kind of assumed it was like that.

Yeah. It's yeah, elective stuff. Yeah, most of the art lady aren't built up to do that and I don't think they're ever going to be. No, because I mean, you're you. Yeah. If you're getting that deep into it and doing an archetype like you should probably know and go find it yourself.

Yeah, I just realized you haven't pecked anyone forever? No, I didn't pack people and he won't O2 probably never will

He thinks that's disgraceful behavior. I was literally about to say, don't you dare come out with that? Would be dishonorable. I out oh you don't want service on training montage with grace and teaching Ochi had a peck as hard as he kicks. Now I would love to, like, learn more about how to use key with you guys because I have it now, but I haven't flavored it.

You know what I mean? I wasn't gonna bust it out just to use like dark vision or something in this fight. I was about to say. So this is the cat at, like, not the character asking. What did you actually take? I took forgotten trick first just cuz like I don't want to go to levels stuck with one thing and like I don't have a ton of key anyways so I want.

Yeah, I use whatever like we need to fix a problem like this, where people were visible, not that there's an ninja tricks that do that but like you know, to have the flexibility there and also bad. Yeah, there are. There is an indict all over. You see invisible? There is Hish Blindsense.

10 feet. Yeah, You can get that out of warrior poet as a move action later, but it's kind of blind sense for like, a short amount of time as move action, you know. Yeah, you better off doing, you get all the way to master trick. You start looking at like other things, but I never will because I'm multi-class tech.

You are kind of old. Yeah, it's you have two classes. That's not multi-class attack. I will have three. Oh no. I by the way. Abby shoot the. It is actually it's a tent bubble ninja trick called. See the unseen. What did I just say If you're asking tricks? Yes, get to master trick it is.

Yes I know forgotten trick. Doesn't let you take a master trick. It does not good god if it did. Yeah, That'll be fun. You can man. You can forgotten trick into vanishing trick though, which I don't plan on doing. But I'm like that's It's a good escape option. Yeah, if we really need to, that's why I took the some of the fugitive grenades like that'd be great.

Same deal. You know what I mean? Smoke bomb disappear into an extra dimensional space. I guess I feel like we're pretty out of character at this point. I don't think we're gonna do much else. So I was gonna ask you guys about the obsidian stuff for the wiki thing.

I have no, I don't think everybody's necessarily interested, the short version is there's two options. I wrote up a document explaining how you can get obsidian and get and get hub on your computer to where we can all update the same one and have access to it in relatively real time.

The other option is that I can publish it for like a monthly cost. Which I'm down for but obsidian has a lot of community-made plugins that are like really sick for RPG campaigns that won't necessarily translate to the website published version if I pay for it. So it'll just be this kind of wiki document with not a lot else going on, which is still great.

So I was gonna see gauge with the interest is if you guys are interested. I could take one person a volunteer to like run them through what you'd have to do to get it online. To that capacity. It's not super hard, but you I did have to do like, right?

Like three lines of code that I found in like, an article explaining it and, you know, you're opening like command window, and you feel like a hacker, I don't know what your guys's experience is, what that sort of thing, but I don't have any. So I was really intimidated at first but that's the lay on the land on that stuff.

I should have really looked into the ability to share or co-edit whatever I was making before. I invested this much time into it is basically the most important takeaway but it is a really powerful tool. If you guys want to be able to like, you know, right into it also then that's there's a there's a certain amount of time investment in that it's like me like and afternoon to figure it all out.

But now that I have I should be able to walk someone through. It fairly easily.

No. Need to respond. Now, I'll post more if you guys are interested, if not, I'll just do the published one and then we can have like the recaps and be able to like see while we're playing. You're like Kim and datsu. Who the heck is that? And you can click on the name.

And eventually, I'll have the page filled out of like Kim and Dotsy was blah, blah. They did blah blah blah. And that sort of thing.

It was fun. Yeah, I think. Oh Now I was only gonna say like my time is already fucked as it is. That's the only thing I get I do. I totally get. I'm I'm doing a lot of admin stuff for other things, um, but like I'm always down to If you need like our reference or just want something to the check someone over my background is that?

I'm I'm very much in encoding and so I'm I'm in information security so oh for sure it's really easy. It's just pushes it uses like a plugin inside of obsidian to push the vault to get hub and then other people can build the same. Like if you have obsidian with the plug in, it'll pull from that same gap It's not super complicated but I don't know nothing about that stuff.

So I had to do quite a bit of doodling, to figure it out, so it was easy and then we'd all be working on the same one and like if somebody writes something in it while we're playing you can see it. You know, that's sort of thing. It's a bully.

Hell, you have written a lot. It's actually up to date to like this to last session right now. But as you can see, if you like click on anything, most of the actual links are pretty much empty at this point, and I'd like to fill them out a little bit more.

But there's some of the plugins are like super, super sick for RPG stuff. They have like a map one where you can put like you know tokens with tags that link you to those pages and like build like a actual timeline on another one. There's just really, really powerful stuff.

I've heard people compare using this for RPGs to a thing called realm worlds that I've never used. But a lot of people like really loved and yeah. Mmm, either really powerful tools. It's just requires a lot of legwork which is fine, you know, and I don't need anybody else to like update it necessarily.

It's just, I feel like it's kind of a pain for me to like, export it. And have you import it like every time like before? Like, when's a good day for everybody to be able to look at it, You know what I mean? If you get it to the point where Amy, when I throw it up in there, it just pops into yours.

So, like the day or two, after the session, and that's a little bit more convenient for everyone. I feel like. But like I said, I could just do the published version but then I won't be able to do like the maps and the timelines and stuff like that. It'll just essentially be a text wiki.

I'll let everybody ponder on that. I might just have the maps of cool stuff online. I just wanted to see what the interest was before. I spent more time, making all that stuff. No, I'm looking at it through now, this is really neat.

You, I am always thoroughly entertained. I by people's like recapping and things. Yeah, I like lose my way between doing like first and third person and like not using certain nouns or pronouns and then using them later and then like, including the fights or not including the fights. So like the tone and the structures really inconsistent right now I mean the best thing to do is just do.

Whatever is like is it consistent enough that you A get that like you get enjoyment out of doing this? Because you know, obviously and I was cool and that people can generally follow it, Believe me. Yeah, I know where you're at. Because back when I was playing in a wolf, the crown game, I went out of my way to make.

I'm pretty sure it's still on Google sites somewhere. I'll pull it up if you really bored. My character was basically obsessive about writing a record sort of it's more of a journal and a lot of it doesn't make a lot of sense without not actively being in the game, but without like some additional information, like everybody in that game very well known NPCs, by which I mean literally like the Grand Prince of Taldor, had some sort of code name and You can work out who's, who if you're familiar with it.

Um, But yeah, now like keeping the consistent tone and stuff like that. I wrote that entire thing in his like like I'm not like a journal um sort of thing. So it like looking back on it, it probably doesn't make any sense to anybody else but trying to be consistent with, it is so hard.

I really use the restroom and my dog, just forced himself through the cat door, so something's obviously going on. Oh yeah. I think what's supposed to be going on So I hear what you're saying and like, that's why I did it. And it's already helped me just like, remember things and restructure things to, where I have a better grasp of what's going on, which is like, most of what I wanted this for, but I was like, this would be really helpful for everyone.

If we don't even want to go this route, if you guys are all like, fluent enough with this sort of stuff to just like, download the vault every time, then it's already going to that GitHub page that I linked and it updates like every time I get in there.

So if you want to know like you can just go pull it from the GitHub and it should be up to date pretty much every time.

So between sessions.

Rock and roll. I'm super stoked to be level 6. Did anybody else get? Really cool stuff. Grayson, did you get like super sick things? How do you just do the feet sizzle? Just two feets. No, big deal. You know what? I got zero feats. You got forbidden track. I can use it one time a day, don't forgot.

Yeah, forgotten. What time a day right now. I nearly took forgotten check myself and then I realized that like the key cost is pretty high. Actually, the key cost isn't a problem at all for now. Waterflex benefits of being a ninja monk. Yeah, definitely. Absolutely, yeah. So I know she's she's pretty good.

So one of the things was to do a thing that we we need someone to deal with like traps and jets. So I've sorted that out the the Nendatrack is ordinarily. I would say a very stupid idea and but no way is a very stupid person. So So out of character, this is a tiny bit revealing, if you don't want to hear it, then I shall not divulge it.

But there is, there is a fact that I've had in the back burner on Noah, since which kind of come into cow's Garden, learned some of the details And I don't want to hear. So I'll head off for the night so or not night but, no, I'm not gonna divulge like what it is.

So, just take care. Grace did So it was a thing I was like huh? I didn't think about that and now I have. So what's the thing I'm sorry? I didn't hear you. Well No, I I thought about something that we've learned as a like while we're in cow's card.

Mm-hmm. And I was like, hmm, This factors of thing. What should I do? Knowing this fact and I have now head cannons, what that fact is. So I've and that's related to my choice of ninja truck. There you go. That's fun stuff. I like obviously Ochi isn't mid-max because I'm doing like seven damage on average but you're you're like a samurai though.

So you challenge stuff and damage that's happening. Yeah. I was like when I was like, trying to run the numbers on whether or not this was going to be a waste of a character slot. I was like, I mean maybe, but like for a boss fights especially with the new order I have better will saves and much better AC against my challenge target.

So I think for like tank in Big Bads like it's a decent option to have OT stand there and get swung out as much as it is for anyone else. You know what I mean? Like I'm not like a heavy armor fighter, but I'm not Zeo standing there. Getting, you know, hit by like the Tetsubou, we are collectively.

A very agile party. Yeah, super dextrous. But yeah, I was surprised by like the challenge. Damage was like, wow, this feels so much better. Like I it's really painful to watch Grayson, just disintegrate somebody from across the map and then walk up to that same person and try and hit him into like five.

I mean Grayson's. Entire thing is that he's he's resign optimal. That's, that's a complete sentence. I imagine he like closes his eyes and just fires like four arrows like the where they're so fast. They almost like line up behind each other and just sink into somebody. Yeah. If I recall he's not actually like that.

Dextrous the dude is just doing doing the wisdom thing. So he's being very efficient and that's like a totally viable way to play. Yeah, he he fires a lot of arrows, but the moment someone uses protection from arrows, right? Yeah. Somebody uses wind wall or snatching. Exactly. Like there's, there's problem So he month leaps at them and kicks him in the face.

Yeah. But he's got to actually monthly and do that and if I recall can Zen arches, even flurry of blows but they can still fury blows but still glory. It was. Yep. It's interesting interesting. Yeah, I mean they don't lose period blows with their fists. They just get confirm, you blow with their with a bow.

Yeah. And well I'm really liking the current party makeup. I think it's going really well. Sorry, again for stepping on, like, ninja toes. I just wanted, I want to flavor it as less like sneaking attack and more. You know, he's just like really precise with where he's doing a stab and I won't be ninja for too many more levels.

I just want to get that key pool, dude, you you are not stepping on any ninja toes. If anything I feel bad. Because unfortunately she says um at least at the moment Noah's characterization is that she's kind of a bitch and it's annoying for me to try and find ways to like keep truth to her kind of chaotic nature.

While also, you know, not being an asshole and I'm hoping that I'm kind of getting out the ideas is that I get, you know. She yeah we'll stop. Yeah, that's the other thing with this. Huge document thing is I want to get myself more into the fiction. So I want to lean more into the character.

I'm having trouble doing the lawful good thing OG's. Kind of drifted somewhat from like his original character concept mostly because of like the party makeup and like the backstory that I came up with after building him out and I'm like okay that doesn't make sense with like who he is and what happened to him and stuff.

So I'm just trying to make him more realized and act that a little better. Yeah, it's usually what happened? Those days you come up with an idea and then you bring them to a table and as with anything, no plans, survives first contact, with the party. So just kind of flex into what you kind of want to be or what makes the most sense.

Yeah, No and I think I definitely want like an alignment shift towards neutral like part of the the samurai order that not the Samurai in the Cavalier ordered. But I mean, same thing it's a time. Yeah, for like being the first line of defense against like the Oni. And in this case, for the, the royal family.

Like he's, it says, right in? Like the very first flavor text block of the order that it's like, they don't give shit about good, or evil or, right, or wrong. They just want to protect the state of the world from the supernatural forces that would seek to destroy it.

And I'm like, that's what he would do. He would see this threat of the only of the five storms and see Amako and be like, I have to stop this. That's my job. Now, you know, yeah, that's like super red. And I think that's like a good thing to have as a as a samurai because Samurai Cavalier any other kind of class combination that gives you an order.

Like having that thing is like, it's your equivalent to the paladin code of conduct, right? Yeah. So, develop the character. Exactly. Exactly. Gives you like a framework to kind of be like, no matter what this is. This is the thing. Yeah, I was like, I always was like, kind of playing with the idea of like switching it, but then as soon as Sans was like, oh Mako just like nights you on the spot.

I was like, fuck this advances my character development so fast and so far. Yeah, that's like super cool because it was fun. Yeah. Anyways. Sorry, I'll chat all day about. OG I'm terrible like that because I have no one in my real life to talk to you about it.

Yo you too. Yeah, mood. Yeah, big mood. Yeah. Big made Ben I can I can talk like stuff like that. I love hearing about how people like want to move their characters through things and who actually have an interest in the roleplay side of it lonely. Yeah, I mean like the way, the way that I came into it was like I played a little bit before but then I started listening to all these actual play podcasts and they just like scratch this itch that I didn't know that I had.

And a lot of them. Just do like fantastic roleplay and backstories and I'm like fuck. That's so cool, man. Like, if I wanted to play a video game, I go play a video game and look at big numbers, you know, I wanted. Yeah, I want to exactly do a character concept and that's super like, fun and cool.

The original one was more of like a sneaky leaning more into the Tango-ness of like stealing and like gaslighting everyone around them about the stealing, you know, it was gonna be like a maroku-esque character from like Inuyasha with his like little staff. He's just oh, yeah, you know, and then like pull out like all these hidden weapons and just like go hard in the paint whenever there was a fight and then just go back to being like, oh, this is really cool.

I'm gonna take this. They're like no, he's like, this is Tango tradition. You're supposed to give me a gift and then now he's like this level. Good child. Who has lost the sassy lost child? Um, yeah no, I love Archie. I think. I think he's like he's really from my perspective, he's really fun to play off.

I have a lot of fun just thinking, like, wow, this this dude is just naive enough. Yeah, and I wanted to believe in the goodness of all things and I am just cynical enough to be like found. Yeah I think it's really fun and that's why I want to get into the fiction of it more is I think he's a really good foil for like the uncaring Grayson and like the ultra like selfish and chaotic no way and the like old and like bitter shoko.

You know what I mean to have this kid following him around or like takes himself really seriously? Because of Mako was like I don't give a shit about tradition. You're a samurai now, you know, like Yeah, like the narratively, the role that I would want to, to make, you know, I kind of go down.

I already kind of know where she'll end up being probably very quickly. You guys wrap up. The frozen shadows is the.

Okay, this is the only way I can really describe it in short term. So in the, in the fall flowing future of whatever she survives. All of this. I'm hoping that she's the kind of character that is look, you you don't ask me for help or anything because I probably already done the thing.

Mmm, you know? Yeah. She's like I I really want to make sure that the people I like and the people that I genuinely love all protected and the length that I will go to ensure that are vicious like secret service level get down, Mr. President while I shoot this guy in the head, Like that's a reducer or anything but like a black widow sort of character art where Yeah, it's really reductionist but it is kind of.

But yeah, it does apply though. I think the only difference is that, at least the kind of the the MCU renditional Chicago, at the very least, is much more moral. Yeah, no way is not and she's not designed to be. If anything perspective on whether or not you should kill someone, or is very much colored by like, look, if you're not alive, then you're no longer really a problem.

Unless you come back as a dead thing in which case if I just hide you, well enough, you probably won't be able to come back as a dead thing, and if you do, it won't be anywhere near anyone. I care about. Yeah. That's so some fun flavors right there.

Yeah. She's, she's supposed to be that kind of mentality, but there is there is like an angle, um, about her. That hoping will have a chance to come out. Because At the very bit, like off, coming off of the back of Brandall. If a party hadn't interacted nearly as like as much and didn't react as they did to, like, by the way, kind of kind of an indigo assassin.

That was supposed to kill your boss, kind of thing, The whole kimon Dotsu. I will come in of colder, ally thing. Yeah. No. I would have kept swinging. Mmm, interesting. So so that is character development, that's not me as the player being like I'm not gonna do this because that fuck your your party over.

We were just all being like generally kind to you a little bit like asking these questions. It's like seeming to give a shit about you. And then you're like these people are kind of nice to me. I think our killed yet More importantly. At least, from Again, I'm being incredibly sappy here.

But from hope perspective, every single time she's had to tell somebody her real name, she's had to kill them and that's not a like oh no. Now I have to kill you thing. It's a that's that's the best sentence thing. And the only people that have ever known her name have been people that she's hated mmm, like genuinely fucking hated.

Nobody has pretty much everybody who's called her Hatsuyuki has plus how to track record for some sort of abuse against her. I would imagine I don't and she is like, okay, like, as my name, it's my background. This is Michael on. I'm assuming that, you know, this information you will want me.

Get. Yeah, I mean like, as a as a rule, that's pretty much what's happened every time. Right. There was some extra cool stuff that I hope we get to learn about just to mentions and like I made they're in the wiki and everything and they're just floating because if you go to the little cool graph view, I have like 12 or 14 dots or so, they aren't connected anything.

And like half of them are just from no ways like character back. I want to know I need these right to connect to other things. So I guess if These are not just going to be random facts, you probably will have like just talked with no about at some point.

Maybe so, you know they're not hidden or anything. Just might have had this conversation over dinner or something or ask Um over Innobushi wine, an individual wine. Exactly. And remember she yeah we we stand plum. Wine in this house is the like If you ask if you ask a you know she's she's responded generally speaking.

Yeah, I'm I'm predominantly erotucky Tian. If you ask what type of Tian she looks at you blank and goes, I have no idea a gathered that. Yeah, yeah. So I think she's like I think my father was somewhere in Honggol which suggests Tian like on. Yeah. It's it's probably not though, because my name is written in Tianshu.

But my name itself is Mikayan Very concealed for us who are like from Chancho like, you know, exactly. And and this kind of leads into like my name is haiku and you're like clearly like Chinese and not just yeah, she's she's she's some amount of amalgamation of she's either Tianju or Mankayan or John Hamp.

Like it's one of those ones. I basically just put flappy hands. I'm gone. Hey, like the ancestry is Medgayan. But that was like 1500 fucking years ago house, right? Yeah, so not relevant to me really at this point. Exactly, exactly. And There is a tiny bit, a little bit, a little bit of a ego but is like half a very, very good reason for why I want to kill all of the frozen shadows in cows.

God, is not even because it's a good idea. It's because when they ask about the first and shadows clan, I get to say that's me. There's one that is really sick. That's a badass character. That's that's one. No, he's going for. She's like you want to talk to the frozen shadow?

That's me. Yeah. The frozen shadow Because once you because she'll admit they have agents all over in the Innocity but their agents. Oh, so they probably don't actually know like any of the ninja techniques or anything. No, So performance and stuff like that. Exactly. So the moment that this is cleared out and you kill them at the root, they're on a morphos and shadows, except for me, the only true frozen shadow.

That's super sick, right? It's so incredibly stupid. And She's like, I am the one. There could be only one. You can be only one that's that is honestly like, it's the dumbest thing. And it wasn't really something that I had in her characterization until we came to Calsguard and just started fucking around.

And I was like, okay, we've now decided that she's actually like Big C chaotic As opposed to like, little see that it was supposed to be. Yeah. When you were like, yeah, I'm not gonna go that far in. And then you like did the whole Rye burner skill, like, without us.

I was like, oh, yeah, this is, this is good to go bad at some point One day. This is. Okay. So So here's here's the tea with that because I know that some people made some certain large explorations of air. I went like that. Could have gone really bad.

You know Like yes, Yes, I know that madness But unfortunately I have played Pathfinder for 20 Well 3.5. So If I think this character can get away I probably can. Yeah. If there's anyone character that could get away really easily is the ninja too. You can vanish your way out of there.

Key points, get the speed and just and just disappear. Yeah just disappear climb up a fucking wall. Like do something just has acrobatics out. They asked to at least run like yeah, one of the cool things made for doing it just stuff. One of the cool things I wanted to do with OG is like flavor.

Some of the key is like him learning from Grayson in a way either like with their help or just like watching and discovering that in himself. But one of the other ones I got psychic, sensitivity is a bonus feat from my order but I also got like knowledge planes and knowledge Arcana.

And there's like all kinds of cool stuff you can do with knowledge plan. So I'm like debating taking flickering step like very very late game just for like utility which I think of you can have also being debating flickering. Yeah you know what I mean? Like just utility of like he can see through the planes.

Like he's like another level of like knowing about the supernatural world just like we need to get the fuck out of here. Everybody grab hands and we all just teleport like not because he's like powerful just because like he knows you know like the right place to like just step through existence.

Yeah. No, I mean if no way survives long enough, I am fully intending that she is going to be like when you think of. So in traditional media, when you think of the ninja, you think of like Oh these people who like our known for assassinations and sneaking into places and being able to kill you in your sleep and that kind of thing, right?

But there's also the other angle of it where people where you can like When ninjas often disguise themselves as certain like commoners or you know Geisha in order to get themselves into a position of particular interest. And yeah um like that side of it is actually no way especialty if you what you ask her.

She's like, I am very good at killing people, but the thing that I was trained to do is get information, which is why. Um, if you use a disguise you toll like any kind It automatically, get a check against it. Mm-hmm. So that's the frozen shadow archetype, right? Yep.

Yeah, I looked at it because I was like, you know, you get the pathfinder disease of like how could I make the most unique character to ever live? And you just stack archetypes on archetypes. And like so I went through all of them. Yeah, no. They the frozen shadow rocketype I would actually argue is pretty bad though.

It definitely is. But you don't see me trying to be a frozen shadow ninja. I'm like, if you have the right circumstance of the prior knowledge of like, what the campaign or like the, you know, whatever you're running is gonna be like, obviously. All skills are useful in certain situations but like in the Pathfinder mathy sense, like they're not great abilities.

Yeah, losing uncanny. Dogs sucks like it, just deals. I didn't think that was gonna be as large of a worry as it's, it's a huge problems campaign. Fucking yeah. Late. Getting getting flanked is like super fucking for me but conversely, I don't intend to be in a position where I ever will be caught out like that.

Yeah, it's oh she's not gonna do any invisibility stuff. But warrior poet. One of the elective abilities is get uncanny Dodge and then also dipping it a ninja. So I could stack them and get them as if I was, you know, a ninja of whatever level. Unfortunately, the bill doing two up and fighting as you know his feet intensive.

So like, you know, getting into those things, it's a little less fee intensive. The problem with warrior poet is that warrior poet is built to do. It's it's built for vital strike. Yeah. That's why I'm like kind of ditching out of it. When I am, like, I want to lean into the key stuff to boost the damage instead of relying on doing that one trick.

Like obviously like spring attack is really great if you don't want to get hit but I just I didn't want to stay 16 or 18 levels of like this one doing this specific thing in combat every time. Yeah especially if you do with like a magnada, I think it's way better or a glaze.

Yeah, it is. You know what it means? Like it's just the build doesn't even really work unless you're using a big fat weapon like that. Yep. So it's like I'm gonna do other things and I've changed my mind on it like a million times. Like now dude, I got this point your conversation today about what fucking like ninja tricks.

I was going to take at level six and I was like, oh, we're leveling to six. And I'm like yeah, at this point like what I want OG to be able to do is to just try and keep up on damage with everybody else and I'm gonna take bar and brawler and use that in combination with forgotten trick to just try and be good at whatever we're dealing with at the time.

And otherwise have like critical focus. And that enough to weapon fighting feeds, it was pretty baller, especially with them. But the elephant in the room yeah it works out a lot better without having to have all the improved feats to do everything Dear God. Yet us There would be no way on this planet.

That no way would have been built to be empty monk. Yeah, and I still want to talk to Shoko about it because I haven't, but I wanted to do this. Wash dip. Also just to get Perry and repost because I think that's like exactly the kind of thing. The Ochi would do, you know what I mean?

But yeah, like I see, I see kind of where you're at and

The thing I would normally suggest I can't suggest because you're a samurai ordinately. In this case, I would have gone, You could go swash, or you could go Cavalier daring champion, but you obviously can't. Yeah, unlimited myself. But I mean, Maybe he died. I've already got a backup like that could, you know, weigh down the road as we get closer to Tianjah could take over.

But like, it's taking care of, by the seal, but I would much rather like the character die if it's not working or if like he actually dies. Oh yeah. There's like a good narrative cut off. Like that would be like I I'm always for the narrative and like, okay player enjoyment is king, you know?

Yeah. And disability dies like defending a mako in the quest to get her two Ming Kai like 10 out of 10, you know what I mean? Even if it's not cool like I'm gonna I'm gonna make it cool in my head. Like, yeah. That's that's like, the best way to kind of look at it.

And and those situations And yeah, if your character doesn't work out, then it doesn't work out. I'm gonna be honest, I wasn't entirely sure now is was going to work out because frankly I didn't know whether or not the party was going to just be all like all right, you dead?

I don't know. That's a tough one. I don't know. I haven't been enough games. I've there's a really funny moment in one of the actual plays that I've listened to where they're like deep in a dungeon when somebody dies and the way, they introduce another character like it's just really hilarious but the one of the original characters, but not that ones was like, I have all these questions for you.

How did you get here? Who are you? And can you cure blindness? And then the guy who's introducing the new character is, like, I'm gonna answer those in reverse order. I can't care blindness. And then the original person was like, kill him immediately. Yeah, there's like those moments are hilarious.

Yeah, I I definitely did those moments for sure. I am. I'm a big proponent of I guess at the narrative and just player enjoyment and having fun with it. And I definitely feel like a I talked too much and my games like collectively you and me both, I think these other people, they are a little bit more here for the hack and slash.

So I try and roll it back to a point where we're just trying to move the story forward, you know, I mean like I want to get my my character notes in because that's how I enjoy this. But like, you know, I want to get to the fight so that Grayson isn't like why the hell am I paying to do 15 minutes?

Yeah fight, but it takes four hours of my day. You know what I mean? Yep. Yeah. I do. I I definitely understand that for sure. It's, it's kind of rough to balance that out. I mean, I got a lot of enjoyment out of roleplay. Stupid shit. That's why when you guys were fighting the ocher jelly, I was like, I ain't doing dick the way over here, double Dover and dying with Koya.

The way, when I like that was probably one of my favorite moments that I've done in this campaign so far is when Joka was like, no, you're supposed to throw rocks is like, don't I came up here so that I could tank it with my major images and I just stepped back and shot it with the two there.

Oh, it's like, yeah, you got it. Go for it. Yes, which is why I was just like I am not fighting a giant pudding. Yeah, No I just didn't have much self-respect at all and she has no concept of shame frankly. But That one was like my mind. I am not fighting.

I walking. I'm not home. That's you in the tapioga. Could go out at alone. Yeah. Yeah. You can you in the tofu can have a good fight over there. I am not touching that problem. Anyways, I could ramble all day. It's always nice talking to you about this stuff.

Like I think you and I are on a very similar page and what we're enjoying about this campaign and what like we could chat about. So glad to having probably good for a while. But yeah. Sorry to sorry to keep you man. No, you're good. I'm just I'm hungry.

I didn't need enough breakfast. Today food is important. You should definitely. My girlfriend is like eight and a half months pregnant right now. So I have to feed her also or she'll relations. Thank you. We're super, super excited. We're making a main character. We're naming him wolf game. So oh my god, amazing.

Yeah, right. Super stoked about that. I gotta build a grill like this weekend. Well, honestly, my best to look for that and congratulations to you both. I hope everything goes well But yeah, Duke get some food. It is. It's good time. Thanks. I'll see you around. See you next week later did
