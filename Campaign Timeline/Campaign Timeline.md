# Introductions

The party meet for the first time in the [[Rusty Dragon]] in [[Sandpoint]]. Either local themselves or with ties to locals they are drawn by the call for goblin heads and the promise of bounty for each one presented to [[Belor Hemlock|the sheriff]] [[Belor Hemlock]]. There have been increasing reports of goblin attacks on the locals when travelling past or through [[Brinestump marsh]]. As they learn this news from [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko Kaijitsu]] she asks them to keep an eye out for her missing shipment of fireworks. Having ordered them for the upcoming festival and not recieved them yet, she offers an extra payment for any returned to her. The group asks her if there is any person of expertise on the marsh they may contact to help them locate the goblins. She recommends they speak to a halfling [[Walthus Proudstump]] who lives on the coastal portion of the marsh and to make sure and try his fish stew. Upon entering the swamp they take the northern-most road heading west to speak to this halfling. They quickly encounter three goblins playing with fireworks. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] calls out to them to lay down their arms. The Goblins take advantage of the warning and attack one of them blinding [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] with fireworks. The goblins are dispatched quickly. The bounty hunters continue to the halfing's home [[Walthus' Home]]. On the way they are shadowed by a [[Soggy Swamp Monster|Pale Figure]] who always seems to be travelling away from them back into the swamp. They continue on and encounter [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons|Skeletons]] bearing the weapons of decidedly foreign origin bearing marks of the [[Tian Xia|Dragon Empires]] including wakizashis. They dispatch them. Believing them to be holdouts from prior undead related events from years past they take some of these items and continue on. Arriving at [[Walthus' Home]] they find his behavior on meeting them very strange. After being invited in they are wary but inquire of his famous stew and to sit and ask him some questions about [[Brinestump marsh]] and the [[Licktoad Goblins]] activities. Seeming to not know his own home and finally slurping down a rat in front of them the party decides something is definitely amiss. The [[Walthus Impersonator]] is slain and [[Walthus Proudstump]] is rescued from his refuge in a panic room in the back of his home. Though injured, shaken, and hungry, he will live. As thanks [[Walthus Proudstump]] gifts the heros some potions, treats their wounds, and sits with them to answer their questions. The information given includes the origin of his imposter the strange nature of it's being so far north in the marsh, The location of a witches hut further south and west along the coast. With darkness falling the companions return to the [[Rusty Dragon]] to regroup and collect the bounty for the fireworks and few goblin heads they've aquired.

# The [[Soggy Swamp Monster|Pale Figure]] and The Village

Returning to [[Brinestump marsh]] with more accurate information they decide they want to investigate this [[Soggy Swamp Monster|Pale Figure]]. Retracting their steps to the point on the path to [[Walthus' Home]] where they saw the creature they set out in the direction it travelled. Finding it to be the [[Soggy Swamp Monster]] and the source of many a missing person from [[Sandpoint]]. They dispatch the creature with [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] nearly being felled. They investigate the bodies and bring the information back to town so that the victims families may know peace. They share what they have learned with the sheriff [[Belor Hemlock]] first who rewards them for the good deed.

They return to [[Brinestump marsh]] again and head towards the [[Licktoad Village|Goblin Camp]] to the best of their knowledge. Upon arrival at [[Licktoad Village]] the adventerers find much of it in ruins and possibly exploded. After some investigation they discover the goblins holed up in one of the still standing buildings with the entry boarded up. The group pries the way open and is immediately assualted by seemingly terrified goblins including the [[Randwattle Gutwad|Goblin Chief]] on his salamander steed. [[Randwattle Gutwad|The Chief]] won't be reasoned with. They dispatch most of them fairly easily and take one alive with several escaping after the heros understanding that they wish to flee. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] insists that they will be of little danger with no chief and their number reduced but [[Grayson]] is very upset by with this sharing his mentor [[Shelalu Andosana]]'s attitude towards [[Sparing the Goblins|sparing Goblins]]. The captive is very forthcoming about the events leading to their fortification inside the building  informing the party that [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons|Clak-Claks]] came from the south in numbers to collect [[Tsutamu's Chest|a chest]] the goblins had looted from either a [[Shipwreck]] in the area or a [[Tsutamu's Cave|Cave]]. They seemed disinterested in the goblins once they had it in their possession and returned south towards [[Tsutamu's Cave|The Cave]]. The party takes this information, what remains of the goods the goblins recovered (including the separate stolen fireworks), and more goblin ears back to [[Sandpoint]] to regroup and rest.

# The [[Tsutamu's Cave|Cave]]

Following up on the goblin's information about the [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons|Clak-Claks]] incursion into [[Licktoad Village]] the party travels back to the village and follows the clear path the [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons|Skeletons]] cut back to [[Tsutamu's Cave|The Cave]] through the swampy undergrowth. On arrival at the [[Tsutamu's Cave|Cave]] [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] cuts down the vines covering the entrance. They enter and find it fairly normal until they reach pooling water as deep as their shoulders in some places. This is compounded by lack of vision in the darkness. Wading through the water they find the bottom of the body to be slick and difficult to cross. When making their way to the second disconnected exposed landing the [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons|Skeletons]] emerge and attack them. The heros stay close together to call out approaching enemies in the dark. They finish dispatching these [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons|skeletons]] and find another more [[Tsutamu|Regal Skeleton]] in the furthest chamber in the back. This skeleton watches them but makes no move until they get close. It lowers it's sword to point it at them as a challenge. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and [[Grayson]] understand the gesture and [[Grayson]] does not interfere. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] is outmatched and surrenders. The skeleton accepts his surrender and lowers his weapon and turns to dust in front of them leaving [[Tsutamu's Chest|a chest]] to the party as well as his weapon the [[Whispering Shrike]]. Inside the [[Tsutamu's Chest|chest]] they find [[Rokuro's letter|a letter]] from [[Tsutoku Amatatsu|Rokuro Kaijitsu]] to his son [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu]] that mentioned some secret that would be revealed at a later date but never was. The rest of it informs the party that they may find more at the old [[The Amatatsu|Kaijitsu]] settlement of [[Brinewall Village]]. They also find inside the [[Tsutamu's Chest|chest]] a richly made [[Kaijitsu Fan map|Fan]] with a map drawn on one side that marks the shipwrecks in the area. They gather the [[Tsutamu's Chest|chest]] to return to town. On the way out they attempt to take a different route stumbling in to a lair of giant spiders who don't spot them. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] insists that they are hurting no one as they have heard no reports of spiders attacking anyone. [[Grayson]] wants to clear them out for the safety of [[Sandpoint]] and the inhabitants of the marsh Ultimately [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] wins out arguing they are too wounded to face them and they end up avoiding the spiders. They return the way they came and depart towards the [[Brinestump Marsh Witch]]es hut on recommendation from [[Belor Hemlock|The Sheriff]] that they perform a wellness check. They arrive and knock and call out for her but she does not appear. They enter anyways apologizing and discover that she seems to have been a casualty of her own experiments. While searching the house [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] discovers her [[Ratling Familiar]] who screeches at him to leave. Not wanting to be rude he asks the creatures relation to the [[Brinestump Marsh Witch]] and understands that she was it's mistress. Backing out and apologizing he informs the others and they exit. As they all reach the front and wonder at what will become of the place the Ratling cracks the door and throws out a bag of goods and tells them to leave. The party does.

# The Possession and The Keep
Having returned to [[Sandpoint]] and relaying their discovery to [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]], the remaining [[Kaijitsus]], they prepare to depart for [[Brinewall Village]] with [[Caravan|Sandru's caravan]] including [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] and [[Shelalu Andosana|Shelalu]]. They see it as an adventure. With many having no other reason to stay they all join up. Waiting on certain preparations they spend some time at the [[Rusty Dragon]] mingling and asking and answering questions. [[Caravan|The Caravan]] sets out. As they near [[Brinewall Village]] [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] starts appear weak and not herself. They come to a point where [[Caravan|The Caravan]] can no longer continue up the path. The party travels the rest of the way on foot. They come on the remains of the place and survey the area. They first check the [[Brinewall Lighthouse]] and find a skeleton key as well as some valuables in a waterproof chest. They bring the chest back to [[Sandru Vhiski|Sandru]] and [[Caravan|The Caravan]]. It's at this point that they realize [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] is extremely unwell. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] determines that she is being possessed by a [[Kami]] which is most unusual. While [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] is weak it doesn't appear to be doing any harm to her. Through her it keeps repeating a cryptic message. [[Ameiko's Possession]]

>*“One treasure beyond two seals in the [[Third Vault]]...” 
>“Beware the birds who wish to fly but cannot...”
>“A key you seek lies in the grip of the [[Nindinzego|Ten-Handed One]]—his fear is your greatest ally...”
>“Beware the cuckolded cuckoo—it is in his shattered silent love you should seek aid...”
>“Grandfather waits in the dark, but he knows not who he was...”*

Lacking the ability to help her they return to [[Brinewall Village]] believing the possessor is telling them something in [[Brinewall keep]] is related. They check [[Brinewall Graveyard|The Graveyard]] when they get back and find no familiar names but encounter a fey creature called [[Spivey]] who has been keeping watch against the evil infesting the keep and maintaining the altar to [[Desna]] and the graves. Our Traveller's ask them about the evil. [[Spivey]] tells them they saw and felt much, [[Corby]]s, Ogres and other worse things. After hearing [[Spivey]]'s information the caravaneers promise to clear the keep so they can be free to travel again. The fey thanks them and blesses the party. They begin investigating the rest of [[Brinewall Village]] and come on the corpse of a [[Sea Drake|Wyrm]] rotting on the beach slain by manufactured weapons. They approach to get a better look and are beset by Reefclaws. They dispatch the creatures and continue on to [[Brinewall keep]]. After some careful reconnaissance they spot some [[Corby]] guards who don't notice them. Upon further probing of the perimeter they find purchase through one of the towers. Making their way in they climb the ladder hoping to find a good vantage to gather more information before engaging but are spotted immediately. They engage the [[Corby]]s who meet them first. Two retreat across the keep yard and up a wall to the main structure and man a catapult. While they begin eliminating the corbies close to them the others on the catapult open fire but miss. At the same time a grotesque pincered beast [[Flatbelly]] and a giant spider appear and engage the party as well. Beset on two fronts the party begin to panic. Luckily after the firing of their first shot the now obviously dilapidated catapult explodes into splinters and the [[Corby]] operators reengage without it. The party prevails in the melee. Just when they think they are done battling however a giant bat [[Mobat]] like creatures swoops around from the other side of the keep and charges them. They shake off it's piercing howl and strike it as it attempts to swoop down on them. The creature in it's wounded state tries to flee but can't escape [[Grayson]]'s aim who ends it with a final pursuing shot.
The party returns to [[Caravan|The Caravan]]

# The [[Kokinu|Oni]] and The Harpy
[[Shoko]] Comes looking for [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] realizing she had departed [[Sandpoint]] and finds the party regrouping at [[Caravan|The Caravan]]. He joins the party after playing a bit of catch up and hearing of [[Ameiko's Possession]]. He recalls that [[Brinewall keep]] is a [[Kaijitsus]] holding from 30 years ago. They set out for the keep again. Arriving at the keep they decide to enter through the front gate this time. Believing they cleared most of the [[Corby]]s and other evils from the outer defenses the travelers still proceed cautiously. Inside the gatehouse they find two dead [[Corby]]s that the party had no hand in killing which raises some suspicions. In the interest of surprise they peek out windows as they pass them and see some large creatures to the east where they have not been yet. Entering the courtyard again they encounter two wrestling Ogrekin which [[Grayson]] had spotted from the gatehouse. [[Shoko]] casts sleep on them and the party dispatches them while they're unconscious. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] abstains [[Refusing to kill the helpless]]. Shortly after they enter the nearest and most southern room of the keep. Inside they find [[Muthilduh]] who is angry we have killed her harem and strikes [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] who is unaware yet of her presence. The party dispatches her also. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] heals the not insignificant damage [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] took in the engagement. Continuing on into the keep entering the main hall (west) they find several [[Corby]]s performing a play for a long-nosed red masked humanoid [[Kokinu]]. They sneak closer and [[Shoko]] tries to put them to sleep as well. He only gets one on the first attempt but gets more on the second. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] moves in a strikes the only conscious [[Corby]] and then runs up to [[Kokinu|the Oni]] who has transformed into a winged [[Tengu]] form and retreats a little. [[Trogolodytes]] pour in from another room off of the hall to the Northeast and engage [[Shoko]] and [[Grayson]] filling the room with a powerful stench. A monitor lizard joins in from the same door also. The party sleeps or kills all the enemies, fighting on two fronts, except the Oni [[Kokinu]] who retreats by disappearing magically[^2]. The party enters the ballroom off of the main hall (Southwest) and spots him on the balcony a floor up and they pursue. Looking out the arrow slits in their chase they spot some giant insectoid creature dwelling in a small body of water (chillin). The [[Kokinu|Oni]] flees again as more [[Corby]]s enter from a series of rooms to the northeast lead by a Corby priest of [[Pazuzu]] [[Nevakali]]. The travellers dispatch them all.
Ascending further they find themselves in the living quarters. Checking all the rooms one by one they encounter an [[Attic Whisperer]] and It steals [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]'s voice and is vanquished by the party thanks to [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] On the walls they discover drawings depicting [[Oni]] and Ninja storming the keep and mudering it's inhabitants. They believe the bookcase fell on the boy in the commotion. The other ghostly inhabitant in the halls outside the living quarter is the remnants of the souls of the [[Murdered Brinewallers]]. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] puts them to rest temporarily and believes that they will find peace when the evil that took their lives and this castle is ousted. Finding much of the rest of the living quarters/ kitchen on the second floor empty with signs of [[Corby]] habitation they also find a defaced shrine to [[Desna]] seeming to be altered to some winged creature the party failed to identify. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] and the others attempt to clean it up. Afterwards they continue on and up.
At the top of the tower they come across a Harpy. She does not speak to the party verbally but instead they take measure of each other and she gestures for them to come closer. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] does and she touches him and communicates telepathically with him. She tells him she is [[Zaiobe]] and she has lost love for the [[Kokinu|Oni]] who they learn is called [[Kokinu]]. [[Kokinu]] serves something called the [[Nindinzego|Ten-Handed One]]. [[Zaiobe]] and [[Kokinu]] used to date. She volunteers to aid us in killing [[Kokinu]]. She has lived in [[Brinewall Village|Brinewall]] for a long time. She tells that there is a[[Third Vault|Vault]] no one has been able to enter thus far. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] tries to communicate this all to his companions through a really terrible game of charades for what is far too long before [[Shoko]] makes him step aside to speed up the process. With [[Zaiobe]] in tow they all journey to the dungeon and clear a southern room containing [[Rotscale]] and two other [[Trogolodytes]] fighting for his amusement as well as a mostly scoured armory. After which they also discover strange spores in an antechamber off the kitchen to the west and after following that to it's source they find a slime creature[^4] they dispatch from range. Even deeper still they find a proper dungeon containing [[Sluwort]] and some prison cells. Having the jump on him and the aid of some Alchemist's fire via [[Shoko]] and [[Zaiobe]] he is quickly ended. Inside one of the cells [[Grayson]] finds one [[Kelda Oxgutter]]. [[Sluwort]] was threatening to eat her. She didn't trust us right away but after a little coaxing her story is revealed. She and her very late party were responsible for the mysterious end of the [[Sea Drake]] back in [[Brinewall Village]]. She was weak after the ordeal and was captured by the [[Corby]]s and Co and brought into [[Brinewall keep]]. She offered aid and also mentioned that she needs to return home at some point and if we help her back to her home of [[Kalsgard]] her family will reward us. Attempting to continue deeper the caravaneers are confroned with a series of what seem impossibly well locked doors into a cave-like chamber we unlock one of the second locks after jamming the first one and get stopped by the third. Returning and trying another route they spot [[Nindinzego]] and [[Kokinu]] in the cavernous room off the dungeon and attempt to sneak up on them. There is a large drop in the path and in crossing it [[Shoko]] stumbles climbing down and the noise of [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]]'s casting of feather fall alerts the enemies ending their ploy for surprise. Long and grueling fight ensues. There's flying. [[Zaiobe]] and [[Grayson]] carry us. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] spends the entire time keeping [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] alive. [[Kokinu]] is pretty much out of spells at this point and employs [[Dancing Wasp]] while [[Nindinzego]] flies high above casting down with a wand and nastier things. The party prevails.

# The Legacy and The [[Amatatsu Seal|Seal]]
[[Zaiobe]] makes it clear that she currently means no harm to the party but considers [[Brinewall keep]] to be her home and with no further common goal gives them 24 hours to conclude their business there before she will consider them tresspassers and slay them. The party thanks her and goes about just that.
After confirming the death of [[Nindinzego]] and [[Kokinu]] the party climbs up the two sheer drop offs constituting the way from the other dungeon related entrance. Faced with an Iron gate with a woman on it and funerary alcoves branching from the way in perpendicular fashion. Part of the room is collapsed and contains flowing motes of light. Knowledge these Alcoves contain the previous commanders of [[Brinewall Village|Brinewall]]
Still not having found anything they believe will help [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] they make sure they have searched the entire cavern system and dungeon under [[Brinewall keep]]. They discover a secret sea cliff walk path that leads straight into the chamber that housed [[Nindinzego]]. 
Making their way back up to make sure they have cleared the ground floor they encounter [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe Icemark]], a short [[Varki]] woman with two shortswords at her sides, poking the dead bodies of the [[Trogolodytes]] the party had killed in the 'throne room'. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] Accompanies us after hearing our business because she loves a mystery. 
Proceeding to the back of the throne room they encounter the only door they had not yet explored due to chasing after [[Kokinu]] earlier. Using a skeleton key they aquired at some point they find It contains a hallway leading to stairs both down and up. As they enter soldiers of blood coagulate into being and instead of attacking thank the adventurers for the death of [[Kokinu]]. One of the next rooms greets them with a decrepit body opening the door which approaches [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and [[Grayson]] and attacks. After dispatching the [[Wight]] they enter the room he came from and find it to be an officers quarters in disarray as if raided or attacked. On the desk they find letters addressed to and from [[Andril Kortun]] the commander of [[Brinewall keep]]. The last of the letters is hastily scribbled and describing the attack on the keep by Ninja and [[Oni]].
The party returns the way it came and then takes the stairs leading downward. There are empty raided vaults here. An Ominous shadowy [[Tian]] man confronts them. 

"I know this name" he says and screams in anguish. 
Weeping he begs them to "Take the [[Amatatsu Seal|seal]] away from here. Take it to my child." and disappears. 

Behind him is a Hidden door through which the party find 3 darkwood chests the left and right of which are locked. Opening the middle chest they find a complex and beautiful red and gold filigreed [[Warding Box|Box]] radiating magic. it is a [[Warding Box]]. Once opened it blinds [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] temporarily and the party detects something even more powerful inside. The source is a [[Amatatsu Seal|Stone Statuette of a Dragon]]. Upon beholding it a vision overtakes the group.

### *[[Visions of Jade]]*
>__*An [[Oni]] army with burning skin, glaring eyes, and sharp tusks, wearing strange armor and wielding exotic weapons—emerge in a storm from a vast forest, then descend upon [[Minkai]]. This vision is swiftly followed by another: [[Emperor Shigure]] dressed in royal robes stands over a simple well, a friend at his side. Suddenly, the friend grows nearly three times in size and is sheathed in a frightening suit of jade armor. The [[Jade Regent|Jade Warrior]] draws a sword and strikes down his royal friend, then holds the bloody sword aloft in triumph. A third vision follows, this time of [[Tsutoku Amatatsu|Tsutoku]] (now known to be the true name of [[Tsutoku Amatatsu|Rokuro Kaijitsu]] handing the legendary sentient sword [[Te No Sui]] to a richly dressed [[Fynn Snaevald|Ulfen Man]] man, [[Fynn Snaevald]], in exchange for a bag of gold to fund his families flight. Finally, this vision fades, and we see [[Ameiko Amatatsu]] waking from  her [[Ameiko's Possession|Possession]] as the [[Kami]] inhabiting her flys back into the [[Amatatsu Seal|Seal]], but she is dressed in the finery of an empress. She rises from sleep not in [[Caravan|The Caravan]], but from a resting spot within the arms of a [[jade throne]].*__

These visions pass in the span of a few heartbeats, and after they do, the [[Amatatsu Scions]] are left with the knowledge that they are just that, That [[Te No Sui]] may have even more knowledge of the [[The Amatatsu|Amatatsu]]'s legacy, That [[Ameiko Amatatsu]] is the heir to the [[The Amatatsu|Amatatsu]] royal family and rightful heir of the [[Jade Throne]] of [[Minkai]], and that the [[Warding Box]] has protected the [[Amatatsu Seal]] from detection by the [[Oni of the Five Storms]] for this long and having the opened it they have revealed themselves to great danger.
With this knowledge the party opens the other chests finding more treasures that appear tailored to their strengths and quickly gather up those items and the [[Warding Box]] to make haste back to [[Caravan|The Caravan]] and [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]]. They discover quite quickly that she is waiting for them back in the throne room. She confirms she also shared in the vision. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] swears himself to her service and in gratitude and her newfound right grants him the title of [[Samurai]]. [[Shoko]] Warns her that she can throw the [[Warding Box]] into the sea and forget it all. [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] says she cannot stand by and allow the suffering under the [[Jade Regent]]. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] asks what she will do. She believes her responsibility to the [[Minkai]]an people too great in spite of no wish to rule.
With all of these thoughts weighing on the party they make their way back to [[Caravan|The Caravan]] where they determine they will head north to [[Kalsgard]] to inquire after [[Te No Sui|the sword]] and the way further north to [[The Crown of the World]] and the northern passage[^1] to [[Minkai]]. After that is determined they ask more of [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]'s reasons for being at [[Brinewall keep]]. She says she is from very far north. Went south for '[[Kireama Icemark|Mother]]'s interest in chronicalling knowledge'. [[Kireama Icemark|Mother]] sent her to 'learn about her own culture.'' With all the sharing going around and various bits of [[Minkai]]an spoken [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] notices [[Shoko]] speaks the tongue as well and asks how he came to be in [[Varisia]] being from [[Minkai]] himself. [[Shoko]] says he "came here a long time ago after altercation back in [[Minkai]] and was saved by [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] when in trouble here." All the while [[Grayson]] shares hot food and strong drink with [[Kelda Oxgutter]] once again keeping up the groups hospitality. With that the party retires and rests with a long journey ahead of them.

# The Merchant and The Raid

Those on watch hear the scrape of wood on sandy gravel as a longship beaches on the shores near [[Caravan|The Caravan]]. Having been detected the [[Ulfen]] Raider's let loose cries and set upon the camp. The [[Scions]] rouse and arm themselves to take up the defense as well as [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]], [[Sandru Vhiski|Sandru]], [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]], and [[Kelda Oxgutter|Kelda]]. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] rushes to aid [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] in her caravan after seeing several raiders enter as he does he spies a large peculiar [[Wodes|Raven]] with a red feather on it's breast which flies off into the night when spotted. The fight ends with the capture of one of the [[Ulfen Raiders]]. The party determines to interrogate him. When he is less than forthcoming [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] threatens to tie stones to the mans feet and send him into the river he came from. The man begins bleeding from his eyes and ears and quickly dies. Confused the party see if the man lives and search his body. They discover a symbol branded on his chest and identify it as a [[Blood Geas]], A mark left by the weapon [[Oathtaker]] a Tetsubo. After discussing they also determine that the longship bearing their attackers is the [[Arl's Hammer]] belonging to [[Asvig Longthews]]. Some in the party share that he is the husband of [[Helva]] who is the real power between the two and a powerful witch. Pondering the thought of a powerful necromancer against them and the mysterious [[Wodes|Raven]] as well as the social and politcal implications of this attack they make a plan to split their forces to enter [[Kalsgard]] in a way to be both less and more conspicuous to draw danger away from [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]].
Come morning with their plan in action they draw near to the city aboard the [[Arl's Hammer]] when a strange golden [[Wei Yan|Flying Monkey]] lands upon the bow of the boat. Calmly smoking a pipe, He is unresponsive to their questions or actions at first. Soon however the [[Xiao]] communicates to them that he is named [[Wei Yan]] and that he is an emissary of [[Shizuru]] come to watch over [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]]. With this new addition they seek out a place to stay and gather information. Over a mix of [[Tian]] and [[Ulfen]] food and drink they as the tavern keep if there is anyone who could guide them north. They are recommended [[Ulf Gormunder]] or his apprentice [[Ukshaka]]. They also inquire about [[Fynn Snaevald]] and where he can be found. They determine to speak to [[Fynn Snaevald|Fynn]] first and set out for his house.
Before reaching their destination the come to a bridge with two statues on the siderails. Upon crossing the statues come to life and attack them. They dispatch them fairly easily. Afterwards they find the traces of the sigils that constituted a trap that must have been laid for them.
Continuing on to the ex-trader's house they are greeted by his house servant and welcomed in. They introduce themselves and their reason for visiting. [[Fynn Snaevald|Fynn]] tells them he no longer has [[Te No Sui]]. He kept it all this time and had always planned to return it to [[Tsutoku Amatatsu|Rokuro]] but he never returned. He had housed and fed [[Tsutoku Amatatsu|Rokuro]] during his families flight and wished them well. About two weeks past thugs in all black dress broke in and stole it leaving only a black [[Wodes]] feather behind. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] thinks these are the signs of the [[Frozen Shadows]]. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] shows [[Fynn Snaevald|Fynn]] the swords he got from the secret [[Third Vault]], [[Fynn Snaevald|Fynn]] admires them and thanks him. At this time a page arrives bearing a scroll for [[Fynn Snaevald|Fynn]]. It contains a declaration of a blood feud between [[Fynn Snaevald|Fynn]] and [[Asvig Longthews]] over unpaid wereguilt. At this point the party decides they need to pay [[Asvig Longthews|Asvig]] a visit.
Sharing all knowledge they have or have gathered on him they focus on the news that they are feasting in celebration of a funeral. [[Snorri Stoneye]] the mad reaver has just passed. He was a very powerful raider who plundered the [[Sotlands]] to the south financed by the [[Rimerunners]]. He fell ill on a recent journey and died very quickly. His assets were sold back to the [[Rimerunners]] before he was even fully dead.
They arrive at the [[Asvig Longthews|Asvig]]'s hall and opt for stealth and reconaissance. Listening at different points of entry and examining the area they determine there are a large number of [[Ulfen]] raiders present and return to town to gather more fighters from [[Caravan|The Caravan]]. Returning in greater force [[Caravan|The Caravan]]eers debate points of entry and whether or not to burn their enemies out finally deciding on storming the rear entrance in force. Making their way in they dispatch a few who are harrassing the kitchen help whom they detain and question. Not finding much information they continue into the long hall where they come upon the scene of [[Helva]] bedding raiders in celebration with many drunken others passed out about the place. [[Asvig Longthews|Asvig]] and those coherent charge and the [[Helva|Witch]] starts working magics. Beating down the sober, slaying [[Asvig Longthews|Asvig]], and holding [[Helva]] at swordpoint they question her. 


---
# The Witch and The Teacher

She tells them that they stole [[Te No Sui|the sword]] and an older/middle aged [[Tian]] woman who walked like a figher paid them well for it. They hid [[Te No Sui|the sword]] in a place no one will ever find it again. inferring the worst the [[scions]] belive they have put [[Te No Sui|the sword]] aboard [[Snorri's Funeral Ship]]. the [[scions]] press [[Helva]] further and she relays that they did not kill [[Snorri Stoneye]] nor were they the ones who left a feather after stealing [[Te No Sui]]. [[Helva]] having shared this information attempts to kill [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] and [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] intervenes preventing a one on one fight. As [[Helva]] passes strange and ominous flames forming a death's head rise from her corpse in the mark of [[Urgathoa]]. The remaing living raiders are offered work with [[Caravan|The Caravan]] and head back to join up. Determined to find [[Snorri's Funeral Ship]] the party quickly heads south and find [[Ukshaka]], [[Ulf Gormunder]]'s apprentice asking us to find him and if we can to bring him to [[Yin Po]] at the shrine of [[Shelyn]] in the [[Fire Quarter]]. [[Ukshaka]] tells the party the location of spear shatter harbor. After finding the location of the ship and with the notion that the missing [[Ulf Gormunder]] may be aboard along with [[Te No Sui|the sword]] they make haste. As they approach those with knowledge of the procedure of these cultural funeral ships share it. Taking three small boats out to ferry they party they close on the [[funeral ship]] but are interrupted by a giant crab intent on feasting on them. They dispatch it and board.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] quickly disables the time released fire starting method. The pass up the body on the pyre and head below decks finding it piled high with treasures but hearing the sounds of movement and chains rattling in the dark. Chained on a long lead is the dead [[Snorri Stoneye]] who is now a draugr. As they discover this there is a commotion above decks and peering back up they find [[Wei Yan]] unconscious and [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] missing and several figures garbed in black poised to attack as lightining unexpectedly strikes the ship setting it ablaze. Most of the party scrambles to get back above decks to recover [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] and [[Grayson]] fells the unliving [[Snorri Stoneye|Snorri]] below and quickly searches for [[Te No Sui]] and [[Ulf Gormunder|Ulf]]. Those above dispatch the [[Frozen Shadows]] assaulting them and [[Grayson]] find neither objects of his search but instead finds [[Zio]] bound and gagged and a strange [[Helgarval|Talking Helmet]]. Releasing him and making haste back up and off the ship the fire is staunched and they turn to questioning the one ninja they had not killed who quickly chooses death by leaping into the deep over betrayal.
Finding [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] nowhere in sight and none of what they came for the [[scions]] regroup sailing back to shor. Introducing himself [[Helgarval]] shares that he is was a familiar to a wizard who died and is now stranded on the material plane. He has spent a great deal of time following the movements of the [[Frozen Shadows]] since. On the way back to [[Kalsgard]] they discuss the [[Frozen Shadows]] hunting them and their knowledge of the group with [[Helgarval]] sharing that they have been using the [[Rimerunners]] as a front for the last few years.
With few leads the [[scions]] make way to the [[Kalsgard Shelyn Temple]] which they find crumbling and burning on their approach with screams coming from inside. Entering they see an Earth elemental standing over the body of an injured priest and hear

> "Leave [[Yin Po|the priest]], Kill them."

screeched from somwhere in the dark. The party engages the earthen behemoth while the voice from the dark urges it to kill them. During the fight it is identified as the [[Wodes|Red Feather Raven]] that has been ahead of them at every turn. [[Grayson]] gifts several arrows to it before it flees as the group reduces the earth elemental to dust.
[[Shoko]] asks the priest what happened and he says it was basically all a blur the [[Wodes|Raven]] appeared and suddenly the earth elemental was there and destroying the place. He doesn't think it was a normal raven. [[Grayson]] agrees pointing out that he put two arrows into it and it didn't even slow it down. We make sure that priest is alright and then show him the token [[Ukshaka]] told us to present to him. 
[[Yin Po]] says "I see. Of course. Come with me" and shows them to the safehouse in the garden shed. On the way [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] expresses they've been looking for [[Ulf Gormunder|Ulf]] but have been unable to locate him. Arriving [[Yin Po]] shows them a secret door inside the shed revealing the [[Shelyn Temple Safehouse]]. The door is currently destroyed. The party notices a large black feather on the floor they believe could only come from a [[Tengu]] as well as a dart from a blowgun. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] examines it and determines it is dosed with blue winnis poison she describes it as standard protocol for the [[Frozen Shadows]] any targets they don't want to kill and draw suspicion to lower profile targets they'll dose with this and this is likely what knocked out [[Wei Yan]] on the [[Funeral Ship]]. Further searching the cellar they find no other trace of [[Ukshaka]]. Discussing the state of their mission they lament the fact that their enemies now hold [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] as well as both of their possible guides for the northern passage. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] points out that Blue Winnis is very hard to cultivate and should make very easy ties to their foes once they can locate a source. Left with only the [[Rimerunners]] guild as a possible lead they determine they desperately need to investigate. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] shares that it is located in the [[Jade Quarter]]. [[Helgarval]] adds that they have been extremely active recently. The party heads toward the [[Ivory Quarter]] to find accomodation and further plan their reconnaisance. Upon approach [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] is nearly killed in an ambush from an [[Ulfen]] archer on the tavern balcony. Closing quickly and chasing her down when she flees [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] corner [[Hekja]] in the alley and intimidate her into surrendering. Finding no amount of pay worth her life she begins sharing what she knows. She was hired by [[Jorgun the Axe]] a [[Werebear]] under a [[Blood Geas]] to kill at least one of the [[Caravan|The Caravan]] to reduce our number. After accepting the contract [[Hekja]] tailed him, a good habit in her profession, as he traveled north away from the city. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] infers from this that the only suitable location to the north that the [[Frozen Shadows]] could be operating out of is [[Ravenscraeg]], a naturally and artificially fortified fortress that belonged to [[Snorri Stoneye]] north of [[Kalsgard]]. Before she can share much more information however a hand sprout from her throat spraying gore out just as [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] were offering [[Hekja]] freedom.

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Thats about what i was expecting"</mark> -[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">"You dissapoint me student"</mark> -[[Omeyani|Ninja]]
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Sensei"</mark> -[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]

The party confused at first in the clash ask if this is someone they shouldn't be killing and [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] assures them that they want her dead. The woman is able to appear and disappear at will making for a very difficult fight which ends with the [[scions]] still breathing and a retreating foe as well as dead assassin and a poisoned shuriken buried in the alley wall. The woman runs up the side of the building and disappears across the rooftops as [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] gives chase up the side of the building losing sight of her. The caravaneers take stock of the throwing star left behind as well as the orginal assassins horse. Understandably having many questions for her [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] urges the party not to do so in the open so they head inside the inn for some privacy. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] informs them of her history with the [[Frozen Shadows]] a la her parentage and her tutelage under [[Omeyani]], the one who addressed her as student a short time ago. She also tells them the mastermind behind this particular band of assassins is [[Kimandatsu]] who reports to the [[Oni of the Five Storms]]. With their foe's strength becoming clearer they also discuss [[Ravenscraeg]]. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] notes it is a likely locale for them as most in the area only travel north to take the northern passage, The [[Path of Agenhai]]. She also reveals her true name to be [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki]], that her father is the head of some even more serious and sinister operation he was called away from the [[Frozen Shadows]] for, and that her mother [[Kireama Icemark|Kireama]] took her away. [[Kireama Icemark|Kireama]] was the reason she was at [[Brinewall Village|Brinewall]], sent to gain an understaning of her own family history or legacy. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] decided then not to kill us and thus damned herself to be an enemy of her former organization. She shares some more nitty gritty on the [[Frozen Shadows]] combat abilities such as most of their number cannot perform ninjutsu like she or [[Omeyani]], and that the [[Wodes|Red Feather Raven]] is somehow associated and working on their behalf or at least for mutual benefit. She assures the group that the [[Rimerunners]] guild office will hold more information for them.

# The Guild and The Frozen Shadows

Having learned all that the party determines they need rest before they act and that they will take watches and recuperate at an inn in the [[Ivory Quarter]] while [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] does some reconaissance on the [[Rimerunners]]. In the morning the party does some shopping on the way to prepare for some of the tricks that they've seen from the [[Frozen Shadows]] so far.
While this is going [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] is carefully watching the [[Rimerunners]] building noting the points of egress and the guards number and shift changes. Only one windows is boarded up and barred. With careful prodding she finds an easy way in and finds herself in an empty office. FInding nothing of interest she continues on to more rooms peering through a keyhole she passes on a room with two lounging guards for a different locked one and picks the lock. It appears to be a storage closet at first but after careful searching she finds a secret door behind a panel. Inside she finds a trapdoor in the floor to another storage location, this one containing a heavy iron lockbox against the north wall. After bypassing the lock on that as well she finds it contains two thousand gold pieces as well as some very importnat looking ledgers and paperwork. Gathering these pilfered treasures up and peering through another portal she decides she's risked enough on her own and makes a mental note of the secret rooms location and carefully covers her tracks and makes her exit. Returning to the others flipping some of her spoils she, [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]], and [[Shoko]] gather everyone to go over [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]'s findings.
The [[Stolen Documents]] confirm that the [[Arl's Hammer]] was rented to [[Asvig Longthews]] on the night of the attack at [[Skalsbridge]] and also that he was contracted by the [[Rimerunners]] to aquire a [[Tian]] artifact from a specific address recognizable as [[Fynn Snaevald]]'s home. They also detail financial transactions of large sums over the last few years to [[Ravenscraeg]] including the artifact which is likely [[Te no Sui]]. All of these orders were approved by someone called [[Kimandatsu|Thorborg Silverskorr]] who is apparently the owner of the [[Rimerunners]]. Also included is the purchase of [[Ravenscraeg]] from [[Snorri Stoneye|Snorri]] several years ago.
While the group is pondering these revelations and confirmations [[Shoko]] raises the idea of using some of this information as a bargaining chip, taking these damning documents and meeting with the [[Rimerunners]] and using them to barter to get [[Ukshaka]] back, assuming that if they don't outright have her there then they'll know her location and we can liberate her without any bloodshed. The others are amenable to this idea.
As they approach the [[Rimerunners]] guild office [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] Hangs back to watch for any deceit from the guild from a rooftop across the street. The rest of the group walks straight in not being stopped by the guard outside and after some strong words to the clerk from [[Shoko]] in spite of a failed 'appointment' ruse [[Kimandatsu|Silverskorr]] agrees to see them.
[[Kimandatsu|Thorborg Silverskorr]] is right through the office door and is apparently a beautiful [[Ulfen]] woman. She asks after the mysterious item we've brought her and [[Shoko]] goes into the notion of our exchange, [[Ukshaka]] for the [[Stolen Documents]]. [[Kimandatsu|Silverskorr]] plays dumb at first but when we mention the [[Shelyn Temple Safehouse]] and the probablilty of [[Ukshaka]] being brought here she says we might be correct. At this point [[Grayson]] passes the [[Stolen Documents]] forward and flashes them to her and repeats the terms of the exchange. 

>"So you're offering the documents that [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] -excuse me- [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Hatsuyuki]] (spoken in perfect Tien) stole in the night?" - [[Kimandatsu|Thorborg Silverskorr]]

Meanwhile [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] is across the street watching this conversation through the barred window to the office. [[Shoko]] feigns ignorance and calls out the womans feigned ignorance of the whereabouts of [[Ulf Gormunder|The Guide]]'s apprentice.

><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"We could both leave here with what we want"</mark> -[[Shoko]]
><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"We could.... but.... what makes you think you're going to be leaving here alive"</mark> - [[Kimandatsu|Thorborg Silverskorr]]

she emphasizes that we're in a building full of her guards.
The group attempts to diffuse with diplomacy while [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Hatsuyuki]] notices a rusted iron-bound massive club under the office desk. As [[Shoko]]'s speech ends [[Kimandatsu|Silverskorr]]'s appearance ripples and changes as she transforms.

As the battle begins [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] turns to [[Shoko]] and says

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"I'm so sorry you were right."</mark>

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] is able to immediately identify [[Kimandatsu|Silverskorr]]'s new appearance as an [[Oni]] and an [[Ogre]] at that. The party including [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] battles it out against the [[Ogre]], [[Omeyani]], and the [[Rimerunners]] guards. [[Grayson]] firing arrows left and right, [[Zio]] nearly freezing [[Omeyani]] in one shot right away. As [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] closes in having recognized the danger she also recognizes the transformed [[Kimandatsu|Silverskorr]] as [[Kimandatsu]] and says 

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Hi boss"</mark> 

and [[Kimandatsu]] grins back at her. Still smiling she attempts to obliterate [[Shoko]] who was left in the office alone with her but he skillfully dodges and deflects all her deadly blows. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] having challenged [[Kimandatsu]] but not wanting to engage in such close quarters yells for [[Shoko]] to retreat out of the room just as [[Zio]] is nearly cleaved in half by a guard's greatsword attack. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] having closed into the room in the fray and spotting her sensei [[Omeyani]] says 

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">''Where are you master."</mark>

and crushes a charm in her fist and spots her magically undetected behind a very wounded [[Zio]]. [[Zio]] having planned ahead for this appears to explode into glitter revealing [[Omeyani]]'s position and retreating to safety outside magically. [[Omeyani]] Recognizes she's been had and beings making several hand signs appearing to split in two which is just in time as [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] appears and takes several swings at her, evaporating her newly made twin. [[Omeyani]] greets her with a 

><mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">"Hello student"</mark> 

proving she can see [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] just as well as [[Omeyani]] can see her. Just when the odds are beginning to favor the [[scions]] however [[Kimandatsu]] finally connects with [[Shoko]] powerfully on the backswing of another miss and he falls unconscious to the ground. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] sees this and tries to make his way to [[Shoko]] and fells another guard. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] attempts to return [[Omeyani]]'s poisoned shuriken from the encounter in the alley but she catches it in midair. [[Grayson]] sinks some more arrows into [[Omeyani]] before she can escape as [[Kimandatsu|Silverskorr]] shifts back into her smaller human form and tries to do the same.
[[Shoko]] having been revived by [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] is able to stand but not fast enough to chase down the retreating shapeshifter. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] hesitates temporarily over the multiple people bleeding out on the office floor but ultimately gives chase and strikes her another time with his blade and says 

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> "Where are you going? We're not done"</mark>
   <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"We are done for now."</mark> 

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] catches up as well in a graceful flash. [[Kimandatsu]] smiles at her seeming to be enjoying this. 

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Come on now, you haven't been put through the wrenches since what, last time my old man was around here? you'll be fine"</mark>-[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"It has been some time since i fought opponents who were worthy"</mark> -[[Kimandatsu]]
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"But you're still losing"</mark> -N 
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"Am i losing?"</mark> -K

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] brandishes her [[Oni]] bane wakizashi at [[Kimandatsu]] who promises all her new friends will die if she uses that on her as he hand coaleseces with ice. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] ponders for a long moment before sheathing the weapon and stepping aside. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] does not attempt to stop her either.

><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"Good Choice"</mark> -[[Kimandatsu]]

She takes literal flight and departs. The [[Wodes|Raven]] accompanies her from the railing
[[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] magically heals [[Shoko]]'s wounds and [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] starts checking on those not standing back in the front office primarily [[Omeyani]] as he begins to attempt to save her [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] approaches and stomps on her neck extinquishing her former masters life.

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I'm going to take it on faith that they didnt even know that their boss was, well, my boss."</mark> - N 

Waving her hand nonchalantly.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"I wanted to find out if Ameiko is still alive"</mark> - O 

Frowning still.

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Maybe she could have said somethign to you but frankly I don't know how much of it would have been useful unless you have ways of detecting people who can lie."</mark> - N 

as she pulls [[Omeyani]]'s clothes back to reveal a lack of a [[blood geas]].

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Is Everyone okay? Shoko you took quite a beating how are you feeling"</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"Augh, Like i just spent a night in the single worst bar in--- where are we again?, About that bad" </mark>- S
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Well you're still alive so if i may offer a personal insight i'd say you haven't been to the worst bar in Kalsguard Also, you took [[Oathtaker]] directly to the face and survived. So I am genuinely impressed"</mark> - N

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] passes [[Shoko]] a few potions of cure light.

The party then does inventory of the room and bodies finding on [[Omeyani]] Deathblade and Black Lotus extract, her dagger [[Deadly Kiss]], 4 shuriken they are sure are magical, a blowgun and darts, masterwork thieves tools, and her also Magical [[Shozoku]]. On the others they find fairly expected weapons and armor and not much else. 

Hearing the commotion downstairs but having been too slow to react several more guards from upstairs make their way the the ground floor and upon seeing what they find to be no longer their business quickly and politely depart. 

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] turns toward the others as this occurs
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Do we want to hire them?"</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Do you really want someone who's going to run away at the first sign of a massive violence" </mark>- N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"That's fair. But we do have a habit of picking up people who used to work for those that we just fought and bringing them with us right Noe?"</mark> - O

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"We did that once i wouldn't call that a habit"</mark> - S
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"No, we have the Raiders and we have Noe"</mark> - O Smiling
She puts up a single finger. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"To be fair, though You didn't exactly know that until fairly recently and you haven't kicked me out yet. So, I can only assume that you're either putting up with me or plotting to have me thrown in the river by the end of the evening, but I'm hoping for the first one."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Your insider knowledge has been absolutely invaluable. Noe. That's is all I am saying"</mark> - O 
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"It has to be. If I don't tell you, I'm gonna die with it."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well, we have no one to ask any questions of and I think we know where we're headed."</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Not unless you know how to talk to the dead. I'm afraid."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"Are we certain that Ushaka's not here."</mark> - G
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"That is an excellent point Grayson perhaps we should take a better look around."</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"Lets search the building."</mark> - S 

They find a clerk who is still in the building who shares Ukshakas location with them being the room with the boarded up windows. Inside they find her bound and gagged.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"We've been looking everywhere for you."</mark> - O.

She mumbles in response. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] frees her. 

>"You have my thanks for freeing me." - [[Ukshaka]]
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"No, thanks necessary. We desperately need your help."</mark> - O
"Have you found any news of [[Ulf Gormunder|Ulf]]?" - [[Ukshaka]]
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"We found zero new of him and we've looked quite a few places, dangerous ones at that. Are you well, Did they harm you?"</mark> - O
"Not beyond the beating they gave me to steal me... with many strange large bird men." - U
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Strange how?"</mark> - O
"Well to be fair. They all looked like you, but they were all wearing these black pajamas." - U
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Please don't call them pajamas."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Those are in fashion lately."</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"I need to get some of those too"</mark> - S
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Do you know how many years you need to study before you actually earn a Shozoku?"</mark> - N

[[Shoko]] just stares knowingly.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well Ukshaka I'm not sure how much you know but from things we found here, and various other interactions with our pajama friends, We believe that they're holding our friend and Ulf at Ravenscrag."</mark> -O [^5]
"Hmm, I know the way. I could show it to you." - U
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"You would take us there? We could use your help"</mark> - O
"If they have captured [[Ulf Gormunder|Ulf]] Of course." - U
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well then I think it settled. I think we should make our way there. Maybe we could do some reconnaissance again. These are very very dangerous enemies we are facing"</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"How, how long is the trip there?"</mark> - G
"Two days walk south of [[Places/Inner Sea/Saga Lands/Land of the Linnorm Kings/Kalsgard/Kalsgard|Kalsgard]] toward those grey hills there. One by horse. The way is boggy with shale hillocks. I will take you there and fight with you, for [[Ulf Gormunder|Ulf]]." - U

[^5]: [[Ravenscraeg]]

The party plans and shops.

During this time [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] attempts to get graysons blood to use as a basis for antitoxins against the poisons we've seen the [[Frozen Shadows]] use so far but he refuses
Later [[Shoko]] pulls [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] aside

><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"Um when we're doing this, when we're assaulting your former clan, are you sure? We might have to kill everyone in there."</mark> - S
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Oh, I'm very much counting on that you do."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"There's nobody want us to try and set aside. No one. You want us to try and spare?"</mark> - S

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] stops, takes off her glasses and ponders the question while cleaning them putting them back on
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I want you to kill them so thoroughly that Pharasma will not recognize their souls when they go for judgment. They're that kind of people. So, no, I don't want you to save anyone. [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] of course that's kind of the whole point of this But the rest? they know what they signed up for"</mark> - N

[[Shoko]] nods.
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I appreciate that you ask though really."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"It's hard thing when we're about to do, but we gotta"</mark> - S

Reaching a defensible clearing the party decides they should rest to be better prepared for the dangers to come but not before an ocre jelly emerges from under the bridge they camp near and attacks them. [[Shoko]] recognizes the creature and relays to the party 
that cutting or stabbing the creature has little effect except to cause it to split into copies of itself creating more enemies.

1.	
[[Zio]] attacks with sonic blast which seems effective
[[Shoko]] creates illusionary copies of himself and charges it.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] fires an arrow out of his sleeve which causes the ooze to duplicate.
Ukshaka charges it.
[[Grayson]] flying kicks his way in and decimates one of the oozes
ooze attacks shoko dispelling an image
2. 
[[Zio]] fires a blast of heat from his hands on the remaining ooze
[[Shoko]] adopts a defensive stance.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] closes the gap and strikes it with his staff.

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] wipes his weapon clean in the grass.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Nice Kick Grayson"</mark> - O 

Elbowing Noe 
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"What did i tell you look at those kicks"</mark>
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Fucking terrifying, Grayson remind me again, Where did you learn how to do that?"</mark> -N
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"No need to remind you. I never told you in the first place"</mark> - G
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Yeah, that was kind of the hint. I was gonna be, you know, like decent about it. But seriously, What school are you from?"</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"I learned it in my clan hold and then a lot of practicing with Shelalu"</mark> - G
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Interesting don't believe i've ever heard of Dwarven-based martial arts but it makes sense, you know? I just expected. It would be more..." </mark>

She makes a motion arounds graysons outline and then almost picks it up and throws it.
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I was expecting more of that from dwarven martial arts"</mark> - N

While this conversation was happening [[Shoko]] strokes his chin over the remains of the defeated jelly.
><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"I think I think that might have been a surprise left for us by the shadows. In which case, if this is their idea of a trap, then I don't think we have much to worry about from their trappings of the castle" </mark>- S

[[Ukshaka]] had made herself busy through this conversation as well readying a place for a fire and with help from [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] who had began gathering wood.

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] queiting surveyed the area noticing very large bird footprints alongside human prints.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] sees her staring once the fire is started and also gazes upon them ponderously 

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"That is a good number of them. We should definitely set watches tonight. I don't to get any closer until we've had some rest."</mark>

[[Shoko]] takes notice and mutters some words under his breath and waving his hands lets out a bird call loud and clear.
As he does this hundreds and hundreds of ravens swirl towards them from out of the surrounding trees landing nearby. 
As they come to rest. One answers shoko.

><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"Yes, You are being hunted."</mark>
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"You would be hunted now if our master knew you called us.</mark> *they know they know they know they know*"
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Your cousins are weird Ochi."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"So are yours."</mark> - O

The party determines a watch order and sets to bed.

In the night on [[Grayson]]s watch he notices bird footprints appear in the snow one by one and hears a twig snap on the other side of camp.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] also notices footprints in another location.

## Ambush
1. 
[[Grayson]] reaches down and picks up a handful of snow and flings it at one of the sets of foot prints shouting "Ambush!" and follows the snowball with an arrow.  As the rest of the party begins waking from his call [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] dodges a stab from an invisible attacker whos illusion melts away into the visage of a somehow blurry [[Tengu]] ninja.
[[Shoko]] who was still sleeping is woken as another assailant sinks their blade into him.
The first one to alert [[Grayson]] closes on him but misses his strike. 
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] tries to grab the assassin closest to him so he can't lose track of him and fails.
Another bird ninja scores a vicious blow against [[zio]] before he can react.
2. 
[[Grayson]] fills the closest enemy with several arrows felling him.
[[Shoko]] counters his assailant but misses holding his deadly spell in his hand.
[[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] taps [[Zio]] with her want reviving him somewhat.
[[Ukshaka]] gets to her feet and readies her weapon.
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] being roused as well readies her weapons and steps into the darkness vanishing from sight.
The [[Tengu]] closest to her steps away from the place [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] melted into the darkness and pulls out a blowgun.
The [[Tengu]] who had already buried his wakizashi in [[Shoko]] once continues trying to eviscerate [[shoko]] and scores another devastating attack on him.
[[Zio]] gains his feet only to be struck by the shadow nearest him. [[Zio]] responds by drawing his mace and striking back.
[[Wei yan]] cannot connect with a [[Tengu]] he tries to attack.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] abandons his plan to grapple the [[Tengu]] drawing his weapons and slashes the [[Tengu]].
The [[Tengu]] nearest [[zio]] stabs him twice and zios health is drained.
[[Helgarval]] tries to strike a ninja and misses.
3. 
[[Grayson]] fires another blazing fast volley at the bird engaged with [[zio]].
[[Shoko]] finally connects with his spell and stands up while his opponent is distracted by his magic.
[[Ukshaka]] swings her sword and strikes the [[Tengu]] again.
A sword appears out of the chest of one of the [[Tengu]] and [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] appears behind him pulling it free and letting it fall to the ground.
The rattled recipient of [[Shoko]]s spell tries to back up but in his unpreparedness is struck by Wei-Yan and barely missed by [[Shoko]].
[[Zio]] pulls a wand out firing magical missiles at the fleeing avian.
Wei-Yan gives chase and strikes him again.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] cirlces around and cuts off his retreat but fails to connect.
[[Grayson]] refrains from ending the fleeing ninja with an arrow seeing [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] attempting to knock him unconcious.
[[Shoko]] catches up to the fray and strikes the [[Tengu]] in the back of the head felling him.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] picks him up and carries him back to the fire to be questioned.

# 
[[Zio]] is coughing during this. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] notices and checks the dart in the snow confirming it is poisoned and pulls a vial from her haori and doses [[Zio]] with it who seems to recover.
	
While the poison seems to have run it's course [[Zio]] seems worse for the wear. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] digs in her pack and pulls out a scroll and performs a divine ritual quickly beseeching [[Desna]] and restoring [[Zio]]s vigor.

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] says a prayer to Hei Feng over the deceased [[Tengu]] lying in the snow and he and [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] begin moving the bodies away from camp searching them in the process. After which [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] helps [[Shoko]] back to caravan to finish resting. Looking at the weapons they carried they realize just how much danger they were in. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] pockets the remaining doses. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] takes a sip of vodka by the fire before shuffling off the administer to [[Shoko]].
"Just to avoid that happening so badly again" - N [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] tosses him one of the charms she is wearing about her neck.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] recognizes it as the charm she crushed when they fought [[Omeyani]].
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] explains how it works and how to activate it to him.
He thanks her and the party beds down for the night.

```
Rest
```
---
In the morning the caravaneers make their way the rest of the way to [[Ravenscraeg]]. They come upon the structure towering up on a cliff consisting of a large hall and tower silent except for the caw of the mass of ravens adorning the roofs, eaves and railings. The way up is a narrow wooden stairway winding up the cliff 90 feet in switchback fashion. In some places the stair is anchored directly into the rock face and others they are suspended upon supports and buttresses driven into the rock. Lichen and moss cover the stairs and rocks with pale vines roots and blooms of Nightshade, Willow herb, and Bog Tea sprouting from the occasional crevice in the stone.

"We should be wary of traps" - N
"I think this is one of the rare times i agree with [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]" - G
"Well, there's nowhere to go but up. Do you want to look around? See if there's another way. I have a feeling. This is gonna be our only method of egress." - O
"I can go and take a look from the top if you'd prefer and see if there's anything on the way down."
"Information would be good. There's not many ways to retreat here." - O
"Yeah don't get yourself too badly harmed." - N

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] takes a few steps forward and dissapears instantly from sight. They party cannot see her but she climbs straight up the cliff using her supernatural abilities and circumvents much of the stairway. She scouts the landing and sees a place where the rock creates a landing upon wich a small hollow is plastered over with what appears to be a huge wasps nest. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] makes a mental note of that.

"How's it looking up there?" - O
"How much do you like wasps?" - N
"They can be really tasty actually, Kind of Spicy" - O
"... " - N

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] continues her survey of the area as she makes her way back down the stair looking for traps. Upon returning to the party she puts a hand on [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and [[Ukshaka]]'s Shoulders.

"It's more or less fine with exception of teh creepy looking wasp nest that looks big enough for me to walk into." - N
" *Son of a bitch* " - [[Ukshaka]] in [[Varki]] whos hand is on her sword
"Sorry she just kind of does that" - O
"You should not do that when we hunt those of your kind." - [[Ukshaka]]
"No, but you probably should have seen me coming" - N
"I do not have a way to see that which is unseen." [[Ukshaka]]
"Well lets march on shall we." - O

And they make their way up the stairs finding no traps on their way and arriving at the rock landing and the strange insectoid mass. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] steps closer to try to examine it while still tens of feet away but before he can infer anything a spider eater with a pincered face, pincered hands and a stinger emerges from the mass. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] recognizes the beast and relays to the party the dangers it poses including a poison that paralyzes unhale victims for weeks at a time and the reproductive method of implating it's young inside those it paralyzes.

It lunges before anyone can react baring pincers and stinger scoring multiple hits on [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] who is unprepared. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] stealing himself against this onlaught and though he has clearly been stung by the creature he doesn't seem overly hurt.
[[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] attempted to strike it and missed.
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] does the same and strikes true flaying the creature then vanishes.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] having recuperated somewhat also attempts to stab him adopting a defensive stance and strikes true on the slightly weakened spider eater.
[[Grayson]] from the rear fires a flurry of arrows ending the spider eaters existence.

"I don't feel great [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]]. Could you help me?" - O
"Given the color of these that's coming out of your sting hole there might I suggest chugging these anti-toxins." - N *tinking as small bottles hit the wooden walkway they stand on*

After having seen the first of the defenses of Ravenscragg [[Grayson]] Focuses his inner energies for a moment and his skin darkens.

"We should be very careful. If this was the front guard, they these things can paralyze you. I don't know how I fought it off but these are very dangerous defensive measures." - O
"I bet they don't get lots of solicitors." - G
"Thank you for healing me by the way [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]]" - O
"Of course darling. Thank you for never... being boring." - [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]]
"See [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] gets it." - N

The adventurers make their way further up the walkway and come upon a wide porch surmounting the rickety conglomeration of stairs and landings below providing a panoramic view of the boggy plains that extend to the hazy horizon. The looming green-grey stone hall of the fortress blocks further progress. Inset arrow slits with heavy wooden shutters flank a bronze banded portal that leads within above three more arrow slits look out over the precipice. Upon this fortress porch more of the avian assassins await the rescuers.

[[Grayson]], more than prepared, sinks several arrows into the foremost frosty shadow who slumps to the planks. 
"I don't think they are here to welcome us." - G
[[Wei yan]] quickly pounces along the railing to close on another.
[[Ukshaka]] draws her sword and shield and steps into the fray.
The feathered defenders step forward and vanish.
One of them appears and strikes at [[Ukshaka]] and connects but [[ukshaka]] seems to have weathered the attack well.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] charges another screaming "Where is [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Lady Ameiko]]?!" and attempt to feint and strike making a pitiful show in his emotional state.
[[Helgarval]] spouts a gout of flame from his visor onto one of the [[Tengu]].
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] slashes at the [[Tengu]] nearest her and cuts it down and vanishes from sight again.
[[Grayson]] sends another volley felling the last of the feathered foes.

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] continues on rushed in his fervor to find [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] "Let's go!" - O

Rows of pillars support the 40-foot high roof of this long hall torches set into pillars sconces and two fire pits set with iron spits in the center of the rust strewn floor give the room a ruddy glow. Several doors open into rooms on either side beneath 10 foot high balconies lined with feasting tables. At the far end of the hall a 15-foot high balcony with the master's high table looks out over all. Smoke holes cut into the roof high above allow in more light, and the croaking of the many ravens that roost on the roofs ridge pole.

"That's a lot of options on where to go." - G
"Check em all." - N
"We may as well start searching." - O

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] walks up to the first door on the right and looks back at [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] and turns back to the door and looks it over for signs of traps. He sees nothing suspicious and opens it. Inside he finds a guard room empty save for rocks and piles of broken rubble. 

"Nothing in here." - O

[[Grayson]] opens the opposing door across the hall and sees a very similar guard room in a similar state.
The party continues down the long hall. When they arrive near the center the ravens in the roof and rafters take wing closing in on the invaders.
"So this is where [[Shoko]] summoned them from." - G *readying his bow*

1

	[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] draws one of her blades and slashes and punches at the assailing murder immediately knocking some of them out of the air.
	[[Zio]] recites an incantation and performs some arcane movements with his hands.
	A frozen shadow steps out from a doorway further down the long hall.
	One of the flocks of ravens descends on [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] pecking and clawing to little effect due to his agility.
	Another mass swarms around his head attempting to peck out his eyes and fails in it's efforts.
	[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] slashes out with both blades in retaliation ending several more birds.
	[[Ukshaka]] screams in pain as another of the flocks manages to gouge at her eyes blinding her.
	[[Wei yan]] scurries past [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and spits out a gout of flame roasting one of the whirlwinds of ravens.
	[[Ukshaka]] swings blindly in a panic at her assailants and misses.
	A door bursts open next to [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] surprising him and revealing another Tengu who looks equally surprised at the scene before him.
	Another tengu appears and stabs [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]].
	[[Grayson]] takes note of more Tengu appearing to the south from doors further down the long hall and attempts to keep them from joining the fray with surpressing fire stepping between shots toward his targets.
	[[Helgarval]] mimics [[Wei Yan]] and roasts the unprepared ravens.
	Someone fires an arrow [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] but narrowly misses. 
	[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] is blocking a doorway still stemming the flow of Ninja from one of the rooms. 
	
2
	
	[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] strikes out with more of her martial arts devastating more of the circling ravens and then vanishes.
	[[Zio]] disappears in one place and appears in another performing more arcane incantations and movements and fires a blast of heat at the last of the frenzied ravens.
	[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] reaches into his belt pouch and pulls out a handful of caltrops which he scatters across the floor in front of the crowded doorway.
	Wei yan continues spitting fire upon the enemies.
	Ukshaka still blinded remains in place unsure of what to do.
	One of the freshly singed ninja passes across the caltrops and leaps back favoring an injured foot.
	Koya touches [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] with a want rejuvenating him.
	Another ninja attempts to pass through the caltrop filled portal also gaining a limp but continues on to strike at [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and misses.
	[[Grayson]] continues to stem the tide of ninja attempting to reinforce from further south in the hall with a hail of arrows stepping further towards them.
	[[Helgarval]] continues adding to the flames started by [[Wei Yan]].
	One of the ninja fires his own bow at [[Grayson]] who is unharmed as 
	Another swings past [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]].
	
3
	
	[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] narrowly misses a ninja with her own blades in return.
	[[Zio]] sprays a contained blizzard from his hands at the foes and two more of the ninja slump.
	[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] closes on the ninja too cautious to traverse the caltrops going the the door into one of the rooms off of the long hall. 
	
Inside ten sleeping pallets lay neatly arranged about this room. At the foot of each is a small locker for personal belongings and an open iron trapdoor sits in the floor and near the east wall.
	
Inside [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]s blade meets with the flesh of his target and finishes it.
[[Wei Yan]] joins [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] in the room running along the wall to leap at the last remaining foe slashing as he does.
Ukshaka continues to hold position blinded.
[[Grayson]] finishes [[Wei Yan]]s work with a few more arrows.
The remaining human shadow sprints to the trap door and throws itself down and out of sight.
	
4

	[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] gives chase and after a moment of confused sounds from below the rest of the caravaneers just hear 
	"Trolls!" Called louldy back up.
	
The room below is a furnace room sweltering from the effort. The coals in the rooms name sake roar opposite the chute [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] just entered from. A heap of coal is stacked against the east wall and an iron door opens in the ceiling above the coal pit. Three crude beds made of poorly cured bear skins and wolf pelts have been thrown on the floor before the fire. A Hog's head, rests between them next to the bloody bones of someone unfortunate creature.
	
The two Troll occupants look up from the boar they were enjoying at their two unexpected guests.
	
	[[Zio]] with a word and a flourish creates several copies of himself and enters the room past the caltrops.
	[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] darts down the trap door after [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] arriving next to her and the fleeing ninja. Seeing that [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] is up to her shinobi tricks again and the ninja is stunned face down on the floor in the face of the trolls [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] buries a sword in his back ending his life.
	
It is at this point that the rooms occupants begin to react the faster of the two commenting.

"Look what we got 'ere, Tasty li'il bird."
	
	
And he strikes [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]].
	Koya also arrives down the chute gracefully on her feet.
	"Oh... You're just right there."
	The other Troll steps up and also attemps to sink his claws into [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]].
	[[Grayson]] hesitates to follow his companions and leave Ukshaka defenseless and alone watches her feel her way to a curtain and duck behind it and gives chase. Landing just as gracefully as Koya he looses an arrow before even fully coming to rest at the bottom of the chute finding the flesh of one of the disturbed diners.
	
5
	
	[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] carves a piece off of one of the Trolls with a deft blade who promptly begins bleeding profusely.
	[[Zio]] joins the fray clambering down the chute himself and upon view the scene in the furnace room applies extra heat to the situation firing a cone of searing flames from his hands onto the trolls.
	[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] zeroes in on the weakness of the more ailing of the two trolls that [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] had carved up and levies a few strikes at it very nearly felling it.
	[[Wei Yan]] makes his way to the fray clambering over [[Zio]] to fire his own cone of flames at the trolls.
	The visibly flagging troll falls with a boom to the floor after this onslaught.
	Koya puts a hand on [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]'s shoulder filling him with healing energies.
	The still standing furnace denizen lashes out at [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] wildly missing on all counts.
	[[Grayson]] sends several more arrows into the flesh of the troll in response.
	[[Helgarval]] spews yet more fire from his mouth on both trolls
	
6
	
	[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] steps up to the remaining troll drawing out her second blade and scores vicious blows sending him to the floor to join his roomate.
	[[Zio]] draws out his mace and brains the helpless foe ending the danger.

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] mutters a prayer under his breath for the life lost.

"You keep praying like that and the gods might actually listen" - N

Surveying the room they find a poorly hidden stash, presumably belonginging to the trolls, under a very thin layer of coals. Inside are gold armbands and a small sack of amethysts.

Now out of the clamor of combat they are able to look around and see another hallyway out of the other side of the furnace room [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] leading the pack steps forward to get a closer look. It is a flooded passage. A deep channel of flowing water crosses. The hall here on the opposite side lies, a heavy timber plank a brass bell, and Clapper hanging from the wall on this side of the stream. 

"Scion of Amatatsu you have come to retrieve me from this place of darkness. You are close now. They have cast me into some sort of dark pit. Seek me out." - T
"Do they have a Ameiko? Have you seen her? Is she alive?!" - O
"I assume this is the Amatatsu you serve?" - T
"Yes!" - O
"I have not touched her mind in this place." - T
"They've captured her and I hope they're holding her here... We will need your help." - O

Seeing everyone else's looks as he has this mental dialouge [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] turns to them.

"I hear... the voice of the sword... I think the sword is here and it's speaking to me." - O
"How hard did you get hit by the troll?" - N looking at [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] quizically.

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] grabs her arm and pulls her closer to the underground stream. 

"Ah, There are multiple scions." - T
"Oh, okay. That's unnerving." - N
"It is good to see the rise of the Amatatsus once more" - T

Now closer and with the others stepping forward as well they party deliberates the way forward. North, South, or the door across the hall.

"The sword. I believe is this way. I think it would be very helpful." - O Nodding forwards.
"Certainly so long as we're not going to get jumped by any further surprises this time around" - N

She steps forward examining the door to the south carefuly for traps and finding none. The door is locked however but [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] expertly applies some mechanical trickery and the door clicks and cedes ingress.

"Now what do you have locked up." - N easing the door open.
The ceiling of this Grand Chamber rises 20 feet overhead. It's heavy beam serving as both Raftors and supports for the great hall above. Teak paneling covers the walls and the floors of polished wood. Along the walls wooden columns rise to the ceiling above bearing banners and emblazoned with pictograms from far off Tian Xia. Above these hang small oil lamps that give up a dim glow. A small, porcelain bowl rests before the center column to the south and four reed mats are arranged before it.

"I think we go this way." - O
"I suspect this might be their equivalent of a Dojo." - N

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] steps in to the room and after nothing unexpected happens his fellows follow him.
The caravaneers spread out across the dojo noting the numerous doors leading from the large main room.
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] quietly edges one open to peek into the interior.
Inside she appraises and shirtless and loose pant clad muscled human meditating with his back turned. He does not notice [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]'s presence. She edges into the room without a sound drawing one of her blades as she does. 

1
	
	[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] attempts to eviscerate him but at the last second he gracefully leaps out of the way.]
	
1
	
Before he can fully recover [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] presses her advantage levying another swing at him which he again narrowly dodges but cannot manage it on the second blade. He slumps to the floor silently.

With the enemy neutralized [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] takes stock of the contents of the room and finds Inside are three beautiful jade raven statuettes, a short spear of master quality, and an amulet made of beast scales. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] examines and then stows these items then emerges from wherever she had vanished to covered in a great deal of blood.

The others unaware of this creep up to various other doors. [[Grayson]] similarly to [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] quietly edges open another door. He is not as successful in supressing his presence from the occupant.

1
	
Before he can fully react to [[Grayson]]'s Intrusion an arrow sprouts from his chest and he cries out alerting any other enemies who may be nearby. 
	
1 
	
	[[Zio]] who is still in the larger hall produces a wand from his belt readying himself for trouble at the cry.
	[[Grayson]] finishes the bleak work he started and snuffs out his target before he can do anymore.
	One of the doors bursts open and [[Zio]], prepared for this, fires off several bolts of magical energy from his wand at the new enemy a similarly garbed human.
	Still standing after the magical barrage the dojo dweller returns a missile in kind in the form of a spear hurled just past [[Zio]].
	Koya who was lingering near the door into the large room hurries forward to assist.
	Another human bursts forth from yet another door. Their eyes settle on [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] and they launch a spear just past her.

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] having casually dodged that "What was sensei doing with you."

Another student clamours out of their room adds to the spears on the floor of the room with another miss.
	
2
	
	[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] closes quickly on one of the students forcing them to dodge her slashes.
	In return one of the students reinforces their peer and strikes [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] with a spinning kick.
	[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] evens the odds for [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] bringing his blades to bear on the pair flanking [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] scoring a hit.
	[[Zio]] unleashes a boulder of snow and Ice impacting one of the trained fists.
	Koya whips her starknife across the room only to have it deflected in the same manner Omeyani had done previously. To the students surprise though the star knife flies back to Koyas hand.
	[[Grayson]] seeing the technique again takes advantage of their distraction to dispatch them with two arrows. His third is sent at another only to have them deflect it in the same fashion.
	The surrounded [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] continues to be beset with fists and feet taking another blow from her masters students.
	
3 
	
She returns strikes in kind.
	[[Wei Yan]] and [[Helgarval]] do fire stuff but their foes are too quick.
	[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] circles around to even the odds. Attempting to cut him off his quarry scores a stab with a spear across his shoulder. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] weathers it and levels his sword before swinging at one of the encirclers.

>"Why don't you try me instead." - O

His blow while full of intent still misses.
	[[Zio]] narrowly misses clubbing another student with his mace.
	Koya closes the distance to [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] and with a touch uses Desna's Grace to mend some of her copious wounds.

4

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] still spewing blood

>"I appreciate you trying."

	[[Grayson]] fires at the unarmed attacker next to [[Zio]] with such a strong draw and precision that their inevitable maneuver to deflect missiles does not stop the shaft.
	[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] continues harrying [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]'s Outflankers but can't connect.
	[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]'s assailants continue pressing their advantage landing even more blows.
	
5
	
	[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] deftly steps around her opponent to change the battlefield to her advantage pressing her attackers back but not connecting with any strikes.
	[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] continues to not be able to cause any real damage to their enemies.
	[[Zio]] returns to his wand tactic pinpointing magical energies to fell one of the remaining students.
	Koya releases a burst of divine energy revivifying her companions.
	[[Grayson]] targets the last remaining enemy but he deflects and dodges all the deadly shots.
	Omeyani's last remaining student continues their assault on [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] landing yet more blows.
	Wei yan passes through his legs and attacks him.
	
6
	
	[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] attempts to fight back but her opponent is much haler than her in her state and her swings fall short.
	[[Helgarval]] fills [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] with angelic energies aiding him.
	[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] steps to close the distance to the remaining foe and with [[Helgarval]]s assistance strikes him twice but he remains standing.
	[[Zio]] goes to use his wand again and the bolts of magic finally overcome the monk.

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] says a prayer for the dead.
[[Grayson]] collects the quality crafted spears that the students were bearing.

The room the battle left the Scions in contains a meditation screen of obviously Tian Ming style. Behind the screen is a small leather trunk. 
inside they find a washer woman's clothes and other possessions, including a disguise kit, an ornate decorative blowgun fashioned from Jade and lapis lazuli, gold pieces in Tian coins, and a writ signed by Sven Bloodeagle that gives the bearer the authority to commandeer any of the Linnorm Kings housecarls within two miles of Kalsgard for up to 12 hours.

> "Do what you want with this. Take it. Burn it. i don't care." - N


Can't think of our skin would would overshadow it. He doesn't always have that actually.
Well, that was the thrilling.
Let's be on our way.

I guess going down the other way that we originally going to go to. Yes, just to be thorough. [[Grayson]] is going to search the room. That was clearly umayani's for like a secret passage.

But you find anything of the sort in that room.

I have no a help me put the board across the thingy. You need, you get across the rushing waters with ease.
Assuming you don't mind balancing too much.
Water shame, that would be.
Do we hear anything in particular from either of these tools? I mean, we know you hear the sound of water coming from this direction. I think that. Yeah, we want to go this way because this is where we could tell the sword was. That is the door locked. Can I just try it or sorry?
Let's back up. Hold up. I want to see if it's trapped.
They want a second opinion. Oh, she says I don't think it's trapped and he tries the door. Oh,

likely for you. It's not trapped. 

opens into a natural cavern 30 feet across and 15 feet high. A waterfall. Pours in through a small aperture, high on the south wall, filling a turbulent pool in the floor and sending a cold spray throughout the room. A smooth ledge extends outward from the door and two large barrels have been set to the right of it. Another ledge sits on the far side of the pool, a smaller cask sits fullness ledge next to a heavy wooden door.
Just a bunch of barrels, casks. Over there.
Do I notice anything strange about the water? Nope, just looks like natural spring water and how high above the water. Are these ledges?
Not too far like maybe the few inches. Okay cool. I'm gonna swim across guys. I want to check this out. Oh no. I walks across. God damn it.
Wet. And you think that like Yep I can move down my speed as a full round action that can go over difficult terrain water been branches. What problem you? It's just cold. It doesn't look like anything. It's in the barrels at the front of the room but the cask next to the other door is sealed and holds an unfamiliar and potent alcohol.
Oh that's not unfamiliar, it's sake from Minkai. Oh, hell yeah, it is a door. Look trap. That's for Gillum sits. Atop the tap, the cask.
Motivated as per gallon.
Yeah, weapon. It is it usually holds. Holy water are. Yeah, no way. Can you take a look at this door? Oh, you want my opinion now? Yeah, sure. White's like takes up, glasses wipes, like a layer of the blood. That was spilling from our forehead and has a look at it.
And it's not trapped. It is most definitely blocks though, and the 29 on that. I was literally just looking at the block.

Pops open.
This room is small and musty Hewn from solid rock near the far wall, stands a low. Well it's opening only a foot in diameter a winch and chain with a rusted steel bucket. Hang from the wall above it. The far corners. It's a pile of old wooden buckets and other debris, rotten broken with several different kinds of fungi growing on their remnant.
How toxic are those and how quickly am I going to die from breathing? This thorosin, not that kind of fungus and disappointed. One importantly, looks down this. Well, tries to the squins a bits. It gets very bright further down the well as a katana wedge into this tiny asshole of lights with gold and red flames.
Oh cheese. White and gold. Yeah way.
This is actually important.
It's kind of like orangey gold flames. Hmm, How did you say this was about like a foot diameter. Oh, but yeah. Well, that would be incredibly problematic if right. There you are. 

I'm retrieving and a will come around one of those down a. Well honestly, who's my goodness. Apparently Google.
Let's complain and more going to fucking gets the book. He claims easily done the well.
Inside up for this. So, very slowly because
This is actually really heavy for him.
Yeah, his push drag is 50 pounds. How broken light heavy? It's like regular katana. Heavy six pounds. So it's it's almost at his lift above head weight and he's kind of got a lift above head. Push not drag. Okay? Okay. I'm hearing a lot of complaints and what I'm actually needing to hear is how far down is it?

Because if you can't pull it, we have this wonderful Fandangled invention, year called rule, I'm getting it. Oh well, why didn't you just send a rope down? Because it was funny funnier to see you get after it. I asked question, even the one who went into this. He me the room time.

We throw it all down to him. Okay, goes through a bag. Pulls up. And last year, is the end of it and hand it. Filing up complaints. With the heavenly Bureau fear. I well, the heavenly bureaucracy can talk in ways until we've gotten back our sail and I would tug on the rope after a minute.

That. And yeah you guys pull out blah ocean endlessly. Excuse me, it's changed. Where did you go? There you are. If we were home.

So this beautiful blade made an ancient Tian style, has both a scabbard and that's so basic looking. I think that makes sense. I it is almost beautiful and its simplicity. It's scabbard is black and glossy and still in perfect condition. And the wrapped handle appears to be made of some form of leather. That you're not familiar with and the gold. Accoutrement are shining sill. Fancy that's rings. A cloth out. Whips off. Whatever dust and gumkit managed to get on old adapter. Archie, you're free my friend and he grabbed out of the vomitasu. Very have my thanks for the rest. It is good. Now, that this plan has finally come to fruition, as I foresaw, They did not foresee the only stealing me before your it's concerned. They've been very hard at work with a concern, you to learn that. They also have our Scions somewhere around here. It does greatly it. That's the like, literally just drops the sword unless he capture that. And then just what I stand is. Like I said, I grab a gingerly. Well, no no. I said I grabbed it, I grab it and tuck it into like the back of my belt, my little OB. you can come with me. S

o here's fun thing. Solution is a plus two defending flaming katana. The endcircle blade of the Amitatsu family and switching can be wielded by any amatatou scion. You don't just have to be a natural ward dependent. You will allow someone who acts in defense of the throne to wield it as well. You hear that? [[Grayson]]. That could be fun. Flurry of katana, Although solution is neutral. Good, any amatatou style. Regardless of the Lightning can Falconing and negative level. This boon is at their discretion. However, and should such a Scion ever betrayed the family or prove. Unworthy. The sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict and because this is an artifact lightly take over your body.

So this might be a little bit of a fine detail. Does does [[Zio]] know anything about what we're talking about with scions and such because he wasn't there. When the the seal was opened and we were made into Scions, he does not We've just been and the seal has not been opened again. 

He's kind of like thinking what's what the hell they talking about. He also can't hear the sword. So, that whole conversation, you guys just was just us talking to a sword while he stands behind us, Though. He might think you're all crazy.

I think is a little late for thinking whether or not we are crazy. And potentially just receiving confirmation at this point.


Which won't be honest. I'm going this way. Think somewhere here, just organic sled me.

You didn't realize yeah, the answer is now though.
Let's drop is a lot. Is it anything? It is that and now it's scroll back all the way up there.

Do you want? Just love how OG? Just kidding me. 

Moving forward. Yep. Boom. The stairs to send into a plain room of mortared. Stone walls, drip, with convincation giving the air a cold claimy feel, but you were supposed to be coming down the stairs over here.

Looks head back up, shall we?

Is the laboratory This room has been hewn from the rock of the Crag and a wooden stare rises along the walls, able some workbenches filled with chamber, holding all matter of Olymp Olympic Crucibels, burners, and assorted tools, as well, as a large glass case, holding one appears via humanoid body. A variety of dried herbs and plants dingle and perfusion from hooks in the bottom of bears and sex and chests. Hold additional equipment and components and have been shoved underneath the stairs. A torch mounted on one of the stairs stair pose illuminates. The chamber with a flickering glow, 

is this where they made you no way.
She gives you a look as, if to contradict you and then goes.

perception check.
The body is wriggling. Not like the body is still alive. Like there's something in the body. Like, lots and lots of small things and they are eating it.

It doesn't actually say how it opens though, I'm assuming. One of the yeah, the top or bottom. Probably comes off, cool. Oh, she's gonna take out a rope. No, it doesn't. And then he's gonna tie the lid closed.


---

Of the alembics, crucibels, burners and assorted tools, as well as a large glass case holding what appears to be a humanoid body. A variety of dried herbs and plants tangle, and perfusion from hooks on the bottoms of the stairs and sax, and chest holding additional equipment components, have been shoved underneath the stairs, a torch mounted on one of the stairs post illuminates, the chamber with a flickering glow,

knowledge check

So terrifying only, let's not talk to them. Only infernal, though, I mind when hell wasps swarms together. They gain an intelligence of six and the ability to use skills and feats and can speak infernal with a voice made up of an amalgamation of their constant. Droning, I have more of a big curiosity to hear what that sounds like.

That would be super cool. I mean, I definitely don't have the vocal structure required to reproduce that, no, I get that. I'm just like, that's you know, what I mean? That's, that's really cool.
And so inside that knowledge check, do we know they're alignment as being like hecka, evil, definitely evil. Okay. They are bourbon from hell literally.
And so their prerogative is to like, go around and do more, horrible wasp stuff to people and make more wasps, they're gonna crawl inside your body, eat out all of your insights and then lay more hellwah, figs than you.
Not necessarily in that order. These are extreme. That's fun. Evil creatures. I say we open it and take them out at [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]'s. Gonna just put a hand on your shoulder. I don't, I don't think that's a very good idea. [[Grayson]]. I say we leave these where they are and just gonna concurrent poppy and paste their defensive line or you guys.
Swarms are serious business. Kind of insane. Yep. And this worm has improved initiative and toughness and the stealth of plus 24. That is insane. There's a reason they said to make sure that the players don't open this tube. You think were killing you. Wow. Okay, 

05:42

Yeah, I will say that seems like a pretty damn good deal. Yeah, It's pretty heavy amount of stuff. But that's what we brought way in, for he can totally carry that.
The monkey kind of just looks at you. Affronted A ringer counter spells, an empty ring of counter spells.
And we came up from here. So, we haven't actually come across this staircase yet here, which I'm good leads up.

You would be correct in this. Okay, let's can we unpause? So we can move around. I was going to. Yep. So sorry, visually see the staircase and just confirm that it goes up. In case we need to retreat to familiar territory. I can't collides with the wall.

Do we work? Are we going to try to take all the equipment and components? Just because it weighs so much since we don't have a bag of holding that that we have to put stuff in.

One bag of holding yet? No, no, he has one but she hasn't really shared it with the group. Yeah, we need to get our hands on one So perhaps we can just grab it on our way out. Instead of lugging it all around currently, I'm gonna call out, this doesn't look super familiar up here.

I think this goes somewhere else, I thought it went back to the main floor. I mean most I have a handy habitat but that's a handy hackersack.

OG's, gonna take some more steps forward.
The OG has ended up the stairs.
Yeah, this all doesn't look familiar. The shoot must have been longer than we thought.

There's a room over here. The Stonewalls turned to heavy timbers. As this tower climbs above the long haul, This landing is dark limited. Only by what little light spills from the room below a steep narrow stare lacking any railing rises through it. Opening in the ceiling. 20 feet above be honest.

Anyway, beyond the stairs, a door side room. Which is that door there? I'm gonna check and see if it's trapped question. Mark very well.
Just a cursory. Look at it before. We touch it.

Those sort of trappings about it. Nope, no. Trappings OT's. Gonna try the door handle to see if it's locked. It is also not lost. Okay, everybody with me. I'm gonna swing this bad boy open. Perhaps stealthily. 
I will attempt to follow stealthily. Oh, hell yeah, dude.

You see this wear bear sitting at a desk with a bottle of wine, this chamber, actually, reaps of stale wine, ring, sweat and wild animals for a rough bed. Sits at the far end in a pot belly stove, rests between the windows next to a cold bucket cross on the stove is a small table holding several empty wine skins and a small oaken statue wet where the werebear Jordan. The ax is currently sitting. 

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] closes the door and he's gonna turn to everyone in a really hush voice and say, the wear bears on the other side of the store. I don't necessarily want to cause any harm to him. He's being controlled. This none of the things that he's doing or to his normal attitude or will. I think we should maybe leave him be for the time being. There's no other rooms in there where I think a mako could be. It's just his bedroom.
No one has raised an alarm yet and he is perfectly content to drown his sorrows and wine for the moment. I think I'm really leaving him to his pain. I'm surprised that huge fight at the entrance wasn't having the alarm raised, 

So let's head back. Perhaps up the stairs further or down the stairs because we came from these stairs here. There were other doors down here. Yeah, down on the other level but I was trying to get back up to the main level. So we know how to get back. You should check the other doors down there. Oh gee. Here's the voice of God and they go back downstairs.

no way has just been sitting in here staring at the wasps making faces of them. I can't move stuck in a loop. I got you.

Well to get back down right now but I mean previously yeah to get here from the lower level, where the sword was we came up from those stairs and just now, we went Also up those stairs and checked all that stuff out. And then came back down the same stairs.
I'm just trying to orient myself. You are correct. Okay.

Oh, she's gonna step up to this one and just track. Try the handles. See if it's locked. It is not. So he cracks it open and then slowly opens it. And what do we see? 

This cramped, corridor runs from one side of the long haul to the other multiple doors open. At either end in all manner of boxes bags, chests and crates have been stacked against the walls. The Raptors hold hooks and nets from which hang additional supplies, a staff room, All the various tools equipment and non-perishable supplies necessary for the maintenance and up Ravens, cracker stored in this hallway, Nearly any sort of mundane tool can be found here, including a portable forage, and a set of masterworks Smith's tools. Yo Hmm. One in everyone is a room of stuff.

[[Grayson]]'s gonna go to this other door down here, and it's gonna try opening it really. It's just little. Listen at it first. Emiru 30 there. It sounds like there's someone in there. 
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] gonna. That sounds humanoid. I. Yeah, I mean, it sounds like a human breathing and  [[Grayson]] turns to [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and just kind of given odd until Oh she's gonna draw his weapons. Eric Cousin all all open the door. Not stalkfully. That door is locked, Right? He points at no way and like Beckens her towards the door.

I am no way. Pushes glasses up nose immediately picks the lock immediately picks the lock and then steps to the side. I'll go through first [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] will do exactly what [[Grayson]] would have done and just open the door. Oh cool. There's a guy, there is a guy who is clearly emaciated and malnourished. Kind of pushed up against the back wall. As the light pours into his one stark room, he closes his eyes and pain of No, no. My name is loot,

guys. There's sick loot in here who are recent shoots an arrow at [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]'s. The back of his neck. I was looking at loose one. That did it. Oh, she's looking at looking at Lou. What does he look like? Is he like doing recognize like the color is he's wearing or it looks like he was once dressed and buying merchants guard. But the months that he spent in this room subsisting on the very meager food that they give him and likely whatever rats, he was able to catch has left him very weak from malnutrition and fever Though. He doesn't seem to have any major injuries on him.

Oh, she's gonna put his swords away. And take a knee in front of this guy and tell him, 
We mean you no harm. We're here looking for some of our friends. We're we're not here to hurt you. In any way? What is your name? I'm [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] Suite,
loot hackers sly. 
Hello Lou. Nice to meet you. 
Don't? I wish you don't work for silver score. 
No, I wish we were meeting under better circumstances. We are very much at odds with the deceptive. Silver score. Do you know? Silver scores? True nature.
Yes, she seems to be some sort of strange. Purplish. Red ogre. 
She is an only in a demon in that odds, with my liege, who they've captured, have you heard or seen them bring anyone in since you've been here? How long have you been here? 
I don't know. I lost count of the days. I was a member of the Reim Runner, Guild Board of shareholders. I voted against a measure that she proposed and I was taken in the night and brought here. 
Well, we can really have for you. You seem to be of good nature and upstanding nature. We're happy to help you get out of here. We just need to find our friends. First We are looking for the guide off Gormander as well as bookshaka the apprentice and our our dear friend Amico. 

[[Grayson]] sense motive, this guy. And what he has said, so far you are more than welcome to. He is completely and utterly telling the truth. 

Are you well enough to travel?
I will travel to get away from this terrible place. There's, There's another one like her. We don't is green with big tusks. He was the one that questioned me the most. 
It wasn't silver score. But another only you think like silverscore. 
He was green though, not like her. 
Hmm, that's very good to know. Thank you for sharing. Have you seen any other special dangers folk like that around.
We've seen many of the frozen shadows themselves. But no, no leaders. Like Kim and Dotsu so far silver score.
So even her name is false, 
you'd be correct.
I heard someone being dragged in a couple of days ago, She was putting up quite the fight. 
That's good to know that she was still alive when she was brought here. Like we said, we're more than happy to help you escape this place but we do have business to attend to first.
If you're well enough that you think you can go down, you're we won't stop you but it might be best to wait until we've maybe dealt with some more of and enforces that dwell here.
I am in no condition to make the truck all the way back to Kel's garden. If there's a place I may wait for you nearby. 
Yeah we could we this is room nearby or another companion of ours is waiting. You could join her there. 
Yes, we could put you with oakshaka and you could help watch over each other. I know Shaka and gold Goremenders names. They are good. People just very acceptable. 
Yes, she was blinded and we did not want to endanger her more. So, perhaps you can watch over each other. 
If anyone comes, I will tell her where to swing. 
That would be perfect.
So and he'll reach out a hand for him and kind of if he wants to put his arm over your shoulder and help him walk and then escort him over to where Okshaka is hanging out. 
We have a spare blade for this. Fine gentleman.
I got a dagger. I can give him.
I'm sure. I I may look a proud alphan but I have little skill in arms.
God, used the wrong answer. Like some protection still better than nothing though. 
At this point, I will fight to live. If you can spare weapon, I will take it. 
That is good. You like to hear that?
Why don't you tell us more about what what they've kept you here for? He said they've been asking you questions. What kind of questions? 
I don't know, really and I don't understand the goatee. The one that keeps questioning me. I don't know what he's after.
Can you give us an example of a question that he asked you?
He was the one that handled my food and he would ask me how I felt after I ate it. 
Oh,
show goes going to cast. Detect magic. There's there's nothing going on with them.
Koya Korea. I'll get poison, there's nothing currently afflicting him, but there's a bit of a lingering trace of poison like someone was testing poisons on him. Mmm.
Not an enviable position to be in. Let's get you off to Ushaka. You should be safer there. 

So we'll throw him over my shoulder a little bit and walk him towards the door. We were out before thinking.

Okay, wine and food stores. This room is dark and cold and numerous barrels, baskets and sacks are stacked about the room butchered carcasses primarily sheep, but a few hogs as well, along with bundles of roots, tubers and herbs. Hang from the wooden rappers overhead. And in one corner sits a clay pot filled with what looks like fresh honeycomb.

The food stuff room and keep in mind. I've got the tech magic up for six minutes. So tell me if that means anything it does not. It's mundane food stuffs in here
this room is Bart from the side. All you have to do is lift the bar up and it unlocks the door.

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] will ask [[Grayson]] or showco to come over and grab the other side of a bar? Because he's only got one arm right now. Kristen why He's helping the old man walk. Okay, we'll pop those bad boys off.

Stay. Well, friends we will come back When we have Mako in hand.

Is that the bird that I smell? 
Yes, we found one of the previous board members of the Rheim Runner's Guild that they took who defied Kim and Dotsu. He's very ill. We brought him here to help. Watch your back and keep both of you safe.

Come friends. You will be my eyes and I will make you a pulses to help with your Everything situation. 
yes. I also have some jerky here. Oh, hell yeah. 
Oh geez. Like kind of get something. We think them have been testing poisons on him, So these probably still got a bit of that, in this system.

OT now realizes, there's a door in this room that I don't know that we've been through before. You have not. He's gonna just try that handle real quick. It opens just fine. Let's see. Full moon. This is eight little boom. 

So after actually searching this room now, you do find all of this.
That's cool. A bunch of swag, a bunch of swag.

All right, watch over each other. We must continue on Be safe.

What do you guys think? Which way should we go? I guess back to all the humor they were like to the doors that we haven't been to.
Oh, we at night. There's one other don't we haven't meant to yet?
He'll check the door for traps.
It may perception. Check. What is this See? Denote. Does that denote anything that we can see in the feeling? There's a trapdoor. Oh, what is the ceiling? I'm pretty sure it's the ceiling. Yes, a trapdoor in the ceiling. That is not hidden. Oh, there's a door to the south here, too.

I didn't even see that if you don't find any traps and you hear the distinct sound of looking.
The real sex back.
He says I hate cooking. I hate clicking sounds. I don't know what it is, but it's looking. I'm gonna try the handles here. If it's locked. It's not locked. Stealthily crack the door open.

Wow. Okay, So you said four frozen shadow ninjas just going about their day cooking.

Stones. Roofed with steeply. Sloping thatch has been constructed against the walls of the main hall and adjacent cliff base. You massive ovens occupy, the south wall and a number of tables, and trestles have been set up about the room for food preparation.

OG's gonna leave the door, just slightly a jar so you can see through it and not touch it and turn around and just tell everybody. There's, there's several more than ninjas in here.
OG is then gonna kick the door open and charge in.

Theo, you're surprise around mover standard. It can be standard.
I'm gonna have, I'm gonna have to five foot step. Sadly. Now, I can cast it for more I'm at, and I don't have to worry about hitting a [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]].
Hey, how would you? Now I need the ninjas. All three of many way. No, all four of them.
No, that does miss this one. Oh and why is it show it on the on the thing because where you originally dropped it? It hit all of them. Okay, All right. So as you can also take free actions during the surprise round.

And choco.

I start  performance Yeah, that's my turn. 
All right, that is good. Do nothing. Okay. Then Consuming arrow and sure. Yep, racing test arrow.
kills the first ninja. 
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]. Oh, gee is going to zoom up in between all of them and pull out his weapons.

Way young, I put steps.
On that close enough.
And boom. Yeah, no I said not close enough.

zio You will probably walk forward playing out his mace, I proceed to beat it with a beat the ninja in front of them.

hoka will just take out his sword and Run on in. lose the door behind him. I'll switch back to YouTube and take a swing at this guy. That here and staggers him

ninja Nice to attack you with butcher knife. He's holding.
And misses that does not hit. And he takes one damage because he was staggered. Yeah. Oh yeah. He drops.

noe
Oh, great thing. You not doing anything. He moved 10 foot and then opened a door. It's door got slammed in his face. He was gonna be like, oh, there's another door over here. I'll go open it. Who close the door behind them, you know? Okay. Yeah, well if that's the case then.

Oh, she's gonna do that.
And I will roll to avoid if I need to, you will need to. But remember the Acrobatic thing cuts your movement in half. That's true. So what am I at right now? Actually, maybe 25. I think yeah, it's a you were here. So Yeah, I wouldn't be able to do that.

58:16

Basically, You could get right up to him. That defeats the purpose of what I want to do. I'll just take the attack of opportunity. butcher knives. Yeah, he hit So I'll take that and then in retaliation, I'm going to balk him. I'm gonna do a bonk.
I forgot to target him. It's okay, open.
Anything else on your turn? I think that's it.
The door slowly creeks open with a monkey hanging from the handle.

I'm sorry. 
call. You was trying to target herself. She hates stabbing people in the back, but these are bad people. 

[[Grayson]]'s gonna go search, the room that he's in, because even though we killed the people in it earlier, we didn't actually search it. I don't think no, you did not see seven.

It doesn't bunk sand haphazardously about this room soon with rumpled bedding assorted clothing and personal items. And the discarded remains of food and empty plates. You have the north door. Sit, two stain foul smelling buckets that are apparently not empty frequently enough.


The hidden Dell, a pitched purest. Delle squeezes between the steeply sloping flanks of the nearby crabs that rise a hundred feet or more of overhead narrow waterfall rushes. The notorian down one of these slopes and collects and they catch pawn next to a batch roof lean-to with two large fieldstone chimneys, which is the kitchen a small torrent exist in this pond wending. Its way towards the Great Hall where it disappears into a metal great in the halls foundation apart from the lean to leads over a narrow. Bridge of rough sawn logs, arching over the stream and further down the defile until it is lost among the rocky outcroppings beyond Interdasking.

I like to thank you luck. Noah, and a room full of various little chemical stuff. And she's basically just being helping herself for the last few minutes while you guys were murdering stuff in the background. 

Numerous wooden bed frames. Look real mattresses occupy. This sparsely furnished room. It does not appear that. Anyone has used this room recently, but it could quarter as many as a dozen.

And he's gonna go up here and check the closet because we found a bunch of stuff in the other one. Nope, this room is empty. Dang. All right, folks, 

Do we want to go back to where we found? Are board member friend, and try and go back up those stairs up, the tower. Or should we try and go down the stairs off of the long haul. 
Let's go up to the second story of the long haul, okay? 
But I said what that what we said. 
Let's do it. 
I mean I think I like going up if I was a ninja overlord that's where I'd be.

What other Natalie? What. Yeah, what's the point of having a big castle? If you don't really enjoy the view to make people think that you would be in the big funny tower when you'd actually stick a wizard in there.

Well, Let's flip that coin.

So we check these oh yeah. Upper closets. Here's the trapdoor, by the way.

Oh, she's gonna try the handle on this one. It is locked.

And one of the other side. So over here is the height table and these are a bunch of other eating tables.

This is the trapdoor that leads directly to the hall beneath.

No. Wait, you just did you go past the high table over here?

Yeah, you would probably assume this as much because chart, but let's see some scald words, roughly carved into the table. With dagger point 

Time is the coin of fools rendered due onto the gods.

Beams carved in stable, where snoring stone? I would have said. Hmm. Oh cool. We've got mad Rambling in here, too. Fantastic. What was that again?

Was words [[Grayson]] since no ways on the other side.
You're pretty good at these sorts of lock things, right? Could you take a look at this? 

Before we do anything  shook us, gonna recast like magic because he's got a funny feeling. Do I get anything? Nope. No magic. Mmm. Well, the way because we can just talk across the hall. Is that one locked on the other side?

the cloakroom. This room holds cloaks and cold weather clothing to outfit the occupants of the hall through the long winters in addition valuable furs and males of raw wood appeared from the old super super here. 
Unique rifle through pockets, nobody happens to have anything in the might suggest wearing us, except things, you know, things being people that are vaguely important. 
perception. Check for those. Searching the room
over a 17 you discover several roles of leather covered in tiny cramps scalded runes stuffed into one chest appear to be the personal diaries of snoring, stone, eye and relates. Not only his vile past but also details of his apocalyptic revelation.

01:15:28

Apocalyptic. You say, Indeed Anyone that can read scald make me a linguistics check?

You find in the rantings. Something we're referring to a concealed cash in the upstairs, flu. I didn't away for the coming winter. Also, in that room is all displayed old snorty. Had a little holiday stash. I thought that sunk with him. Sudden apparently he did very well first until we go and find that stash doing a murder and stuff. There's a reason he was called the Mad River. Where would that flu be? i think you're kind of just hand waving that. But where would that at the end of the haul? It says in the upstairs flu. I don't even know what a flu is. It's a fireplace thing.

If someone could move me would be greatly appreciated. I can't quite be my computer right now, you

Say the stores locked. Good. It is 29. It's open 

wooden pegs on the walls of this chamber holds shields and scabbards wooden sands. Hold chainmail, hobler, Hallbergs and open chest sold arrows, and axes, a number of spheres have also been stacked together in one corner. This room is Raven crabs Armory and there is magic in here.

Oh, there is a single magical arrow in the 225 arrows. In the chest. Oh, Starcraft Fold story, really didn't spare any expense? 

Yes, smell crap. Please.

And the bum. Do they single greater magical beast? Slang arrow. No. I spend that around and hand it over to Greyson.

Well, I think we found everything. We're going to find up here. 

Oops. It never unlocked the door for you. It's all right. So long as a giant, spider thing doesn't creep out of it and try and eat me. Oh, that's absolutely going to happen. This is farm waiting for it.

But she just hear himself. Yeah, I'm just hoping the princess and decided to get herself into a bit of bother. I'll just be always there. A staggered low bat on the map.

And because I felt like it. Okay above. I didn't know, like it.

Oh we'll see too much fat. Would you preferred less fat as opposed to know that Just regular bat would have been acceptable? The boom and then with a screeching screaming sound. Oh, it's here. Several raven swarms drop from the openings in the ceiling.

initiative. Whatever. I don't want to fight the giant rear and swarms but they have eyeballs for you.

No. Okay. I guess I'm going to ready ready in action when they get caught within range then like I guess,
Here. I forget one of that more than that range. I will cast a spell. It'll be a  nowball okay. Hello.
Lose what you see important in reflex. Save.
All right. Play will technically be blind for one day.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] They're too far away from me to really do anything. I will run all the way up into do some stab on this other one. Perhaps.
That hits.
zio casts snowball here and a bunch of frozen birds fall from the sky.
Koya heals
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] is gonna throw hands lands a strike

[[Grayson]]. pull out some blunt arrows, and we'll shoot at the swarm. killing them.
See, you don't need to be scared of all swarms. You guys can handle the ratings forms, just fine.

they look for the red feather raven and dont see it

Oh, close the cases. Now going to be smelling up, roasted bird for at least the next little while, but still no closer to finding what we're actually here for, I take it. Oh, and a frozenberg Township. Oh, I'm dessert. Wonderful.

So you guys have searched the entirely now of the first floor and second floor of the long novel. So the only places left are open to that tower or back down to the dungeon.

I think we're not towards the power for me to find that.
And if I don't know, here might as well Since we don't know whether she is up or down, triple up.

so we're heading for the tower, right?

This room off behind the staircase, is Jordan, the axis bedroom, where we left him alone to drink in his sorrows because he's level good and being forced to do.

How do you remove one of those? By the way that something we could remove from it. Well, then my case apparently you put it yourself into contact with an incredibly powerful artifact and it blats it off. But I get the suspicion that wouldn't work for him and more importantly you certain that he's so goodly intended.

It's true. Well, he seems sad so I didn't want to hurt him. He did, he was drowning in wine. It looked like I just sounds like something man, if you want to fight it you can go fight him. I'll stand right here and watch.

She now that you've laid some eggs and had them hatch, you've become very soft on us. 

I think you and I both know, I've been very soft the entire time. 
Yep, you're right. Oh excellent. Remember that one time? I spared some goblins. 
Oh boy, what just happened? He's just, 
Why would you do that?
That was what I say. All right, your backseat drivers. Get up here and die with me.

Above. There's about to be a lot of bird on bird violence right here. There's a super bird on bird violence going. Okay, I'm sorry. No, you you don't need to worry. They were waiting for someone to step up on the stairs before. This is against flat-footed as they popped out of invisibility, dang.

We've been thinking sneak attack. Hold on one second.

I don't think I have it yet. If you're looking for uncanny, you don't have it. Yeah, well I can take it from the flourishes for warrior poet too and I don't look, it doesn't look like I have. So yeah, that gets me. Yeah, you. Yeah. And it's back which is sick.

It is quick. So I took a stab and I took another stab, what you got too fast, but they're not get sneak attacks off on me. Oh, they do. Oh boy, I set up sneak attacks separately.

OG just goes of 23 points of damage outs.

And then the next encounter will be good.

Okay, koias right here.

The tower they are in has openings for windows that are open to the elements bringing in a chill from outside. A fireplace stands against one wall, it's ashes cold. next to a stack of firewood. A trapdoor with a wooden ladder leading to it opens in the ceiling to the southwest. Six light cots are spaced about this chamber with a small footlocker next to each

The chamber in the rear is empty of furnishings and the floor is splattered with bird droppings. The room's door has been removed but half open shutters bear many marks and scratches covering two arrow slits in the walls. A nest of ragged blankets and bits of thatch and straw lies against the center of this wall. Large black feathers are scattered about the room lying thickest around the nest and then the final one, This chamber holds this simple bed and a table.

The room next door holds a simple bed and table bearing a water pitcher and basin. A fireplace stands in the eastern wall.

shoko moves double move
No way. steps up and coup de grace tengu
ochi readies his weapons for the last and hidden tengu to appear
zio tries to foil their invisibility with a cloud of glittery magic but they do not appear.
undetectable avian slashes Koya then appears.
Koya lashes out with her star knife in response knocking him out the window.

as everyone recovers from the fight the poison makes its way through koya

Does anyone have a way to deal with poison? - shoko

I didn't know better. I'd say you really want to die. - noe 

koya, is gonna cast spell on herself.

Koya resists the poison

Ochi puts his hand on koya's shoulder worried over her expression.
He continues worrying over her as Zio pulls out a potion
The group begins frantically feed Koya potions to restore her faster than the poison is killing her.

"Poisons don't do anything Noe. I'm making shit up says Grayson."

 Koya? Are you all right? Are you okay? Koya. Koya say something
 that was the most intense poison I've ever encountered.
 You are very, very strong my friend. I'm glad you're still with us.
 Pretty sure I saw stars there for a moment.
Tesla's not ready for you yet.
Here's my journey is not a defend.
You've got another 90 years in UI. Swear.
Ha, I hope not. 
So I think for today it's probably for the best that we get you back with the others - S
I would not want to leave you without your, I am. Alright, to go on
Only continue with us. If you can Kwaya, we dont' want to lose you
 [[Shoko]] shakes aside and says would you will be fine on our own for the rest of us? We don't
We will not, but you can say that
Koya casts another spell on herself restoring the rest of her health
See, that's not sure back. She's just little late,
Well trials and tribulations, young. Knowing that's not expect us to go through them. 
[[Grayson]], what were you doing over here? I nearly died,
 just enjoying the view. 
Ochi peers out of the window with him.
 Oh gee. Oh, hold this rope.

Noe rounds the corner as Grayson has one leg out the window. She looks at the pair of them, then the rope, then outside
"what are you trying to do."

Grayson finished clambering out and collects the remains of the bird only to start plucking it immediately. Also finding a scroll and a ring.
“What the actual fuck?” - O
“What, have you never killed and eaten a chicken before?” - G 
“I've never skinned a person who looks like you right next to you.” - O 
“You don't look like him.” - G
Noe begins laughing hysterically.
“Your feathers may be blood red 'cause you're covered in blood all the time but you're not him.” - G
“My own blood” - O 
"Can we get back to saving ameiko" 

The group then notices there's a trap door that goes through the ceiling.

Ochis murmurs a prayer to Hei Feng under his breath over all the dead Tengu and Ravens 
He sidles up to Shoko shortly after who is staring at the trap door
"Where does it go?"
As Shoko tests the ladder Ochi spots the fireplace. Remembering Snorri's writings he feels around and finds the mentioned stashed including Boots of Winterland.

Shoko by this time starts his way up the ladder opening the hatch. Above he finds the Rooks nest. A wooden platform has been built into the thatched roof of the tower. It is backed by wooden siding while the far edge is a sheer drop off to the veil below. The trap doors sits in the corner of the roof and a small wire coup with a wooden table next to it sits in the shelter formed by the roof's peak. The entire platform and joining roof are thick with bird droppings and numerous blackbirds flutter around and croak ominously.

Ochi takes the time to pull some food out and lure one of the ravens and snare it and stows it gently in his pack for later. That doesn't stop the raven from squawking angrily in a flurry of feathers.

Grayson spots something shiny among the bird droppings and recovers a diamond all the while watching Ochi's proceedings.

"Ochi are you able to talk to crows or Ravens?" - G
"No" - O
"See even more reason why you're not one of them." - G
"I'm going to follow Noe now."

The aforementioned is tapping her foot impatiently at the bottom of the tower.
Grayson shrugs rolling his eyes to Shoko and Zio.

Having found no sign of Ameiko or Kimmandatsu the party scours over the keep again mapping out as far as they have explored it searching for some passageway they may have missed. They find it when they retrace the Dojo downstairs in the storage closet. 

Inside the room is a brazier in the corner which glows faintly with red coals, it's smoke reminiscent of the stench of scorched flesh. A short bed with a headboard carved with the image of an open mouthed demon stands against one wall and a small table cluttered with books, scrolls, and a stuffed and mounted sturge sits across from it. A magic circle has been scribed in the center of the floor with chalk. Torn paper, bits of food and other debris are scattered about the room collecting in corners and under the bed and table. 

Ochi takes notice of the contents of the table.

The items on the table hold an assorted paraphernalia related to magic research including a partially scribed scroll of planar binding. The scroll is incomplete. The circle on the floor is an outline for a protective circle for use with the planar binding spell. Examination of the brazier confirms that strips of dried flesh have been burns in it to create the repellent odor.

"Horrifying." - O

"I do not know of any mantras that would involve stripping the flesh and wearing it on display like that." - N

As the group hovers over the circle to make sense of it a very large hand to crawls out from under the bed and leaps towards Ochi's face.

1.

Noe readies her blades to strike it out of the air but hears Koya yell out that bladed weapons will cause it to explode in a burst of sickness.
"It will wha--" - N
She quickly shifts her strike and punches it instead with her blade gripped in her fist.

"Why is so many things in here like this?" - N visibly annoyed.

Shoko reaches out to disrupt the undead hand but narrowly misses.

The hand retaliates but also fails to meet it's mark.

Ochi hearing Koya's warning plants a kick into the Giant Hand lacking the correct martial arts training though he leaves himself open and is stuck in kind by the creature.

Grayson rushes through the doorway and lands a kick of his own.

Koya also enters and places a hand on Ochi's shoulder mending him once again and then quickly lashes out with a glowing hand to cleanse the unliving hand.

Helgarval flies forward and charges past the hand missing.

2.

Noe lashes out unarmed again but does not connect.

Shoko tries again to disrupt the hand magically and connects with it.

Wei Yan cannot affect the hand so doesn't even try

The hand lunges at Ochi again but can't hit.

Ochi lashes back with fist but it's inneffective

Koya fills the hand with positive energy ending it's undeath

Looking around for an explanation for the strange goings on in here [[Grayson]] and [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] find a hidden compartment in the Demon's head's Mouth. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] finds a secret trigger opening it right in front of the group. This reveals a staircase.

"I sense her. She is very angry" - T
"She's here!" - O

Ochi runs down the stairs.
Noe follows at a less frenetic pace.

This hallway widens into a small chamber with a door exiting through the south. The door is banded with white straps of iron and bears a large heavy lock. A single brazier provides dim lights to this area.
Ochi spots several shambling figures up ahead.

"There are people here." - O

Said figures turn to Ochi

"She said you would come." - Troll
"She was right." - O
"Are you ready to die." - Troll
"As ready as you are." - O

00:17

What they nerfed it into. Does anything in its scale? Econom anymore. No, they made it so that you functionally treat as though. You're intelligent score is too high. That's it that's that's all you do You just you just treat it as though you're base. Intelligent score is too high on which basically negates the the orc problem of having a penalty.

00:37

It's the same reason that keep playing Space Teflings have infernal a heritage, you know, that gives them their their plus two functional charisma back, Same thing.

00:52

That's pretty cool, actually. Yeah, it's it's all right. The the Comcasting was was by far more amusing version, for sure. It was also extremely powerful.

01:17

But not, you are quite right, it did exist and then, Empirezo, decided nunu, none of this, that wasn't what we meant.

01:27

Oh boy. That's a busy in this world. Those are alarmingly fast skeletons. It's skeleton time. They do their match. They do the monster the Pokey stop. Are they we you these are tokens that you had made are they skeletons or zombies? Because you is delicious. Okay. While you're stealing is just such a deeply amusing concept to me.

02:06

Because when you pictures and skeletons and fantasy, all you can hear in your head is cleidoclack. Really? I just spooky scary, He Game is pause. So I'm able to do things. Apologies. There we go. I will go ahead and delete like the front two, you know, like you. Okay.

02:31

Try to art skeletons. Like really strong against piercing, Grayson presses control tilde and opens up the console and delete actor. Skeleton one I do have Bluntaros that way. Do you have those religion? Nope, but I think it was something we learned in the past. We I will take us.

03:00

I will take us back in the portal. I raise this in like session to of this campaign. I was like, do I know that or regular roll for that? And you were like and you also bought a couple of the goblin village. Yeah, you were saying that for most people, they do like encounter skeletons and most people know that slashing doesn't hurt them.

03:23

We're seriously. You need budgeting irrelevant for OG. I don't pierce anything. But I like the idea of basically everyone in this world encounter skeletons that they're kind of like rats the boom one comes out from under your fridge and you're like God damn it. Not again. Yep.

03:50

Unfortunately, the second attack will miss. All right, and help still take a five foot step forward because that's something it was true play.

04:30

Equipment. There will Double move.

04:40

Little tea drinks. Oh shit.

04:49

Have we heard any thing about a troll spellcaster Decor? Did we like miss some hints about there? Being one or something? The merchant did mention a green troll, the merchant being Finn. No, the mercy rescued up others. I got you.

05:15

Okay? Because I was wondering if this was one of those cases, where there's like a cool enemy, but there's absolutely no knowledge in advance that. They're existence, Binding out. The, that goatee exists is actually quite difficult because you never leaves the stronghold. So the most snippets you get is that there's a troll smokaster but everyone just sort of assumes.

05:42

It's coming datsu as we did butcher, Okay? Yeah, we gonna walk up to there and I'm going to swing on. No, now I'm gonna swing on the front one.

06:22

So brutal, I'm sorry. Can I I meant to put on combat expertise because I'm gonna walk in here later where all these people are and I forgot to check it, but that would have been too lower and I would then have that defensive buff on for until next round.

06:41

That is totally fine. Okay. I'm the skeleton has an AC of 16. I'm gonna turn that on.

06:55

And that's gonna be pretty much OG Stern.

07:02

Well, this isn't sure do drug class If nobody else has seen it in Kuya. Didn't say anything either. Oh she's gonna yell back. There's a green troll character back here. He looks to be magical.

07:18

Not again.

07:23

I'm and get that guy out of the way.

07:36

Remote really, really misses

07:43

Interesting. That's gonna be a no for me, dog. Good news. And now most certainly. But for some reason, there's the finest five in. That shouldn't be.

08:04

Couldn't even get swords for a skeletons. Nope.

08:12

No way. Okay, so someone's gonna have to remind me what the rules are for tumbling through multiple squares.

08:23

Because she's just gonna double move. Actually can to, like there alone. One acrobatics, check, one, acrobatics. Check coming up to friend their skeletons. He is 14. The one dude gets plus 5 because you go through your square. They never even noticed you went by. They just now start to turn and look at you.

08:53

It doesn't mean the course of Persia wall, run and leaps over them. I'm invisible. So I know they're just If they don't even notice, she is going to, in fact, go one further then because I just remembered, I have a fight, a 10 foot movement, speed increased. Thank you, Cohan and and loiter here because that was my double move action to try and figure out what this dudes deal is.

09:25

Hmm. Do you have any particular weapons or anything notable other than the fact? Giant ish Polish Actually. That's that's small for troll, isn't it? He is actually medium sized. That's I'm nerving. But other than that, looks like a troll. He has a picked on him and a crossbow. The pickets and hand right now but he doesn't look like he's in any rush to Join melee.

10:05

Mmm. Okay. Well that was staying. Do I have How much for this day? I got mad because I wanted to make it that's it. Cool, as far as I can go. So sustainability.

10:23

I didn't realize you could move through an enemy square If you don't CMD plus 5. Yeah. Okay. I just wouldn't remember if it like, goes up by two for every person that you're trying until both her, It's something like that. Isn't. But you can sew with 32 probably. Does it very much so, and you only went through one.

10:59

Was bitch.

11:09

It for some reason, his red weapon is broken again. So I'm just gonna leave back there for now. Choco. Oh, shoko will. Oh, freak out another one of these because Durge barred baby. What? Even if they are mindless undead, my enchantment spells still affect them.

11:52

All one of the yeah, one of one of them.

12:04

And in a strange turn of events.

12:14

You see two skeletons drop to the ground? Like a empty. A bag full of bones.

12:26

Joker will butt with stuff forward. And like, I know I could probably just move a five and then what is it to move through allies?

12:40

Nothing, Nothing you have to say, excuse me.

12:47

Right? There's courtesy I guess. 15. Ah, and then I get to hear and I will begin. Making in acrobatics check or Actually? No, I won't. I'll just take it off. 20, 25. 30 you next to LA.

13:20

Actually, no, I'll be over here instead. Uh,

13:27

You missed it anyways. Which ones are sleeps before and this one. Okay, thank you and whipping out my blade and shield. I turn to face the troll, man.

13:49

You don't have to do this. You know, You can turn and walk away if you need to

13:57

Nobody says No The skeleton is moving past no way so that really depends on what she does. Oh yeah. No I'm not. Yeah, I and Goki holds up his hand and says, wait the skeleton halt pack.

14:23

You will let me leave.

14:30

We just more. We just want the girl that was taking care of here and guide. Those are the only reasons we're here.

14:42

Well, there were two captive women in one captive, man. So we already have to. We need one more.

14:55

Look, shock as a lady if I remember correctly.

15:02

That's the guy that she works for also. Oh gormander. Yeah, want me to make a diplomacy role.

15:17

More interested in if you need to make a blood roll way. I don't understand everybody. Pause vote. Do we want to let this guy go? Well, he doesn't seem to have done anything personally to us. Has he Not yet?

15:41

I will not spell blood where it's not necessary.

15:48

Grace in the way. What say you and Shoko like a shoko's just more from that pragmatic reason, he prefer not to waste time and blood on this guy Spell sluts.

16:09

You guys probably remember that though. It was very explicit about. She doesn't want any survivors. Oh okay. Okay, I mean right now would be a great time for a sneak attack. Just say, Wouldn't it? Just Wait until it lowers his guard, really get into character, you know, wait till he's like, oh, thanks man.

16:31

And then just write in the neck. I mean, In character you you are aware that. Like I said, no, it was really explicit about that and hasn't really shown any signs of Connoring. Anything else?

16:51

So units can definitely make like whatever dreams you want. That would be in character just you are probably aware that. There is a ninja that is going to regardless probably stab him in the back. Well why don't you tell are you with? Are you with the frozen shadows? Are you one of them?

17:11

I think that the way it was pretty clear that all of the people in this building are gonna die. So, do we kill the merchant upstairs? Then I mean I'm not going to but he is on him. He's got a lot of his torso exposed.

17:36

Either way, I mean, no way silent because she doesn't want to lose her invisibility but we know her feelings on it Grace and hasn't piped up but I have said, okay so it's really up to you. What you want to say to this guy but people may kill him, anyways.

17:51

Yeah. Shoka will ask if he's took a little note that you don't have seem to have one of those geosses on you, Are you not a member of the frozen shadows? No, they fund my research.

18:14

Pretty church.

18:18

So are you the one? Who poisoned the merchant? That was locked in the room downstairs. He trades many things, You tried many things or he tried many things.

18:35

Mm-hmm. How do you feel about being arrested?

18:43

No, I thought so. Okay.

18:54

It would let you go bite. If all you do is go by,

19:03

Well, I think that depends on what happens next. And she'll go will just let the pause linger. He's basically non-verbally. Like, can I like, what's the check to pass a secret message to somebody? Oh, that's fun. Let's do that. It's black. And since motive. All right, and more linguistics.

19:31

Oh, well blockcheck, a Doy. I'm gonna make that. So I guess noise sets motive. Would you Wait is a is a high level? Check that for this? No, it's good for that. You are being very secretive, but no way. I don't know, I guess, no way maybe has to make sure.

19:52

So this is where I have to tell you, yes, a bluff. A high blood is bad because you are someone famously discerning, your ability to like you know, hide your secret message. And also the person that you are trying to secret message, to has to decipher, like the fact that you're being very sneaky about it and I'm just gonna tell you, right?

20:11

No, I can't hit that.

20:16

These difficulties can be reduced by coming up with some sort of party science system. Oh, she doesn't catch it and work with the crown. Yeah. There's there's like somethings but like all right, well then, so he just stares at him and says that'll depend. Yeah, Exactly. That all depends on what happens next and they're just stares out of

20:50

I mean, out of character, I'm just gonna tell you, he's getting shanked. Yeah, yeah. No, there was absolutely, I was trying to pass. There was it's up to, you know what, there was no moral quandary for OG until we opened a dialogue. But now you've put me in a terrible position as a lawful good character.

21:13

I think the only thing I could say that is what is your knowledge of Trolls and the fact that he's clearly controlling a bunch of skeletons? Well, I don't even know necessarily me as a player. I barely know what a troll is, but also, like we haven't rolled in knowledge, check on him.

21:26

So, I have no idea.

21:32

Grace of those five feet forward and he just doesn't know. He doesn't know what's going on up there. Fully the he has no idea. So he he's actually just going to delay his terms like I guess he doesn't move. Five feet, What Grayson have the insight to hit that because it's kind of just a The secret message is more weight to see what Noid does.

21:55

Grayson whips, his bow and spins it a little bit and curves his arrow around the corner and shoots. Again in the face I was wanted gets it does have a really good sense motive. But I don't, I don't know if you want. I can roll it. Yep. You can recognize what he's trying to say.

22:20

Take 10 on it. So we could just sit here for however, long that actually takes in game time. Staring at him. Alright, so Shoko. Just in case of gone. Crazy. Yeah. So, Tracy, just turn the middle of this sentence Grissom delays until combat resumes. If that if it does resume, Okay?

22:47

Bones. Let's see. Yeah, clear. Gets it. No, but she's still gonna move right on over here.

23:07

Baby welcome.

23:19

And So are we out of an issue of right now? Because like Oji would take a few steps forward and say something to this guy. We are not out of initiative yet. Okay, I mean he could just say it from over here. I think we should let the, I can't remember his name, the rhyme Runners board trustee decide.

23:44

If we let this guy go or not because oh she would love to see him face justice if he's gonna surrender because he was like fully doing horrible experiments down here. Well, it is OG certain but we're not swinging on anybody yet. So I'm gonna is this a live moving?

24:04

Skeleton in front of me. Yep, they're asleep.

24:10

Okay, he's just gonna take a couple steps forward over here and address the stroll character. I don't think I can allow you to go. There are people here who have suffered under your experiments, who I would not feel comfortable letting that pass. So, we will allow you to live.

24:30

If you come with us and allow us to bind you and keep you here, until we deal with Kim and Dotsu. Otherwise, You must stand and fight.

24:46

Humans have spoke true. No concept of honor. You would change the agreement. After already presenting terms. No, the original There's no honor anything. There's no agreement test you agreed. I did not agree. I said I didn't want any bloodshed, You've decided that the terms are not acceptable for you.

25:14

Do not question my owner, you will offered terms, I accepted Now you change the terms. You're interpretation will cause your blood to cover the floor of this room today.

25:36

I know she's gonna get ready as weapons and just be ready to shit goes down. I already took like an actual movement, so I don't think I can do much else. I can't like delay in action, right?

25:48

No. But that's fine. Yeah, he's awkward. Stand up rounds. Yep. Will boom because mostly skeletons are asleep and can't obey commands. This is also in the heat of the moment. I think Ochi's allowed a couple of seconds to think about the ramekifications of taking life. All right, questioning my honor Of course, of course.

26:19

Can you clear your throughout right before you killed him? Can you just stab pretty much? It's like that's nice to know. And then you see this flash attack. So this is the first one, it will.

26:41

Does that one? Hold on kids. Despite but in here it is against his flat foot in which is a 15. Yeah, cool. So that's it. Hits gouges out three pointed natural armor. If he has any You may have one point said, counters out that and then almost immediately after that blade comes in she seems to like flick her in and out again and another strip comes down.

27:29

And this guy is not only, I take, it is nothing on me but that is three. So we are back to form. So the second attack apparently does not land square, which is unfortunate, freaky feet.

27:54

And he roars in fury all of the stereotypes and things that have told them about humans have turned out true. Oh no. Anyway, Humans are terrible. I agree with him.

28:14

But one of us is a bird, I said what I said, they'll go you're up.

28:29

All right. Ah,

28:35

Five, 10 15. What to eat? Gladly, take the two off. Payoffs these things can't apparently hit us. You say that and then they're gonna roll that to 20. I'm waiting for it until I walk up there. They'll hit me with a crit? No, no.

29:05

Also a no yes. See that big fat 24 on there? Yeah, sure. Go does not scared for these guys. Uh and then I will drop the shield once I get here so I can swing with this.

29:24

And Miss will miss him and fit because he has one less AC right now. Oh cleansing. Straight Reduces his natural armor by one and that was enough. No ways murdery, nickname is the peeler, then he will make a save against.

29:51

Is it, Where is it this? Because spellstoring I'm starting to feel bad.

30:06

Just say not in there again. Sorry.

30:24

You're calling me Bob McManzany's. The one doing this, You're the peeler that is actually he's the sleeper.

30:46

And that is that is more or less. Now I thought it's yeah it is an externally bloody effect just doing potato, peelers, cheese, grater generally, yes. And that will be shut those turn.

31:16

Oh nope we got the peeler the sleeper legs and Birdman just likes.

31:33

Right.

31:41

Super, thank you.

31:46

I don't believe either of those hit. Indeed, barely.

32:01

I just realized this guy's carrying a pic. You said This guy's gonna crit me? Isn't he? Once again, it depends on if he makes it safe. Next 30. Me Wait, does he make the same with the beginning of this time? What else would he? Oh, It tried on it son this will get kind of something new saving through to India.

32:29

That's This. Bill is not as good as I thought. That spell is meant for coral and dead.

32:43

On that second one hits because I dropped my shield. Nope. Yay. You took the clock? Boom, great soon.

32:59

Because it all look back before, we're will shoot at the one within the back there. I've got it selected.

33:14

And then if there's arrows left after it dies, it'll be aiming at the ones that are asleep on the floor, starting with one closest to him.

33:29

That's a start.

33:55

She actually misses.

34:03

Booty going to take. If I put dip this way and cast the principally. Wait, can you find the stuff on outbreak is gonna make the safers?

34:20

Which she doesn't.

34:26

So, your main staggered and fails test principally,

34:37

Cookie. Oh, she gonna do a smack a bones.

34:48

That will prevent He gets away on me.

34:55

He can try. He seems to be the lucky one.

35:03

He fails.

35:16

And that's going to be OG stern. That's going to.

35:24

No way.

35:29

Did this guy take his reblade damage or

35:39

Does he not heal? I don't understand. I don't just kind of that's why every generation. Oh, Okay. Interesting. I'm going to use interesting kind of thing being medium, so it's not weird. Um, do do Boy, howdy I wonder what I'm gonna do swing.

36:09

First time.

36:15

Second swing.

36:23

And that's it for my turn.

36:28

Coco.

36:33

She'll go. But what steps here and takes us on swing.

36:43

That'll be a 19 with blanking that will miss, right?

37:23

Bill and look like you got this.

37:31

Great Sam.

37:41

But they can't see animates, so he will lose.

38:01

Then take one shot.

38:31

Okay. Koya, roll three ones.

38:39

3.741. And that's not overly pleased about the questionable moral of this conversation.

39:11

Oh yeah. That'll make it here on some phone.

39:52

You know.

40:12

You.

40:19

All right, let's see how about his final 12 plus this up.

40:35

He detracts himself, Let's distract himself in his confusion.

40:48

Really, that's what he's got. Hey, I said he was a sorcerer. I didn't say what level.

41:03

Oh, Wait isn't only invisible right now. Nope.

41:15

Oh, she's gonna roll up on him and hold up one of his walkie zaches and say it's not too late to leave here with your life. You can answer for your crimes as great as they are. They can still be redeemable. You don't have to die here today.

41:37

You offered me release and then offered my arrest, which is just a prolonged death of the end of the orphans here. You offered nothing and he spits at you because the orphan will just straight the fuck up. Execute him on basis of what he is alone. I was trying to save you from my friend here, but if you insist on dying, I can't help you.

42:09

An OG's. Just gonna stand back a little bit and actually take a step back. Well, if he survives this next and around with no way, then Shoko might have a suggestion. So that's OG's turn. He gave him this chance.

42:25

All right. No way. I like how I'm being referred to as a murderous bitch at this point but you know You're not wrong. Stab first swing. Compound drops him. Okay, If he had passed the no-way trial, he might have been allowed to live, but he was weak. So now he dies.

42:56

Almost got 77 HP in wheat. That's that's a skewed logging people's. That's true. He didn't even have the pleasure of undergoing being racist. Grayson's little pin cushion from a moment. So thankfully, I think this way out was much more humane Shoko would have suggested that maybe we take him with us, like on the caravan like community service.

43:24

Our terms, it wouldn't be a loss of these lands, but Chukko isn't thoughtful goodies neutral. So, he doesn't care what the open thing.

43:38

Well my only question is like, is he, is he dead dead? Or is he just bleeding out? My big question here is. Do you follow through with the second attack? Indeed, in Indeed, that is that is the thing because of the first attack and brought them plate, I'm trying to debate whether or not know it has enough to even swing.

44:00

Again, you know that unconscious trolls are not necessarily dead troll. Yeah, but this one also leads and keeps bleeding. Hmm, that's true. He does. So in the interest of time actually I'm going to say that note is like not even listening to you guys debates right now and is just on the notion of no you know what that's fine and uses for move actions actually like just just start going off down another guard up.

44:36

So As you know, as you if he's still breathing, when we come back this way, I'm going to take him into custody.

44:53

You'll want to stop the bleeding. Then she's she says, from the court. Well, let's find out. He needs In 18 to stabilize on his turn unless someone is going to execute him.

45:12

Circle will use his term to bind his hands and get away. As a is, his material components from him. Foreign spell, focus, whichever one he was using. The sorcerer none.

45:36

Well then bind his hands and Can you do somatic colors with your hands about? Okay. Okay. Ochi. Can't take it if he's bound and we've got him. Yeah, on casting hand and find his hands gag his mouth. Then he's gonna try and stop his bleeding and at least just leaving unconscious.

45:59

Yeah. Bunch chuckle will also try to stop his bleeding.

46:06

All right. Well, are you binding or trying to stop this bleeding binding? First stupid, because troll don't know if he's going to get back up. Reason, Are you going to allow them to continue or execute the trouble? Here's a well move up and loop the body. He does stay alive, whether bound or escapes or otherwise, at least you won't have his stuff.

46:39

We'll have this stuff. I love it. Grayson, that's the third option. There's Paragon, there's Renegade and then and then there's RPG player. Yes, breaks. It opens the third option which is puzzle. Grayson Grayson loots his body and then starts searching the room for secret doors.

47:02

Oh my god.

47:11

Play over there is having a crisis.

47:18

Boom. Come on the rush day. We've got a Scion to find does not stabilize on his turn that's lady Sion. Amigo to you takes another six, bleed damage.

47:36

We'll fly into the princess wherever she may be, you know, come on that. I did not mean to believe him not to be. I think that's sixth leading, right? I've done it. It does not actually.

48:05

There is a door back here, by the way, in the way the minus 14. Oh, gee OG going to step up and try and do a heel. Check on him to stop the bleeding. Does that sound right? Yep, Though. I am gonna need heal. Check from you. And I don't think it's factored in but I do have a kit.

48:28

I think it gives me a circumstance. Bonus bless you? Yeah. Plus to

48:41

14. Fourth team is one shy. Okay. Are we still acting in rounds?

48:53

We are because he has two HP left where he's dead. Dead. Okay. Well, I was gonna like drink a potion myself, but that's really all I can do. I don't have money other actions. I can take to try and do what I'm trying to do here. So that's gonna be my turn.

49:14

I guess. All right. No way now we're just leaving them. Do it. You're just gonna go see what's up with. Is there anything like noticeable iconography on like this door?

49:34

Which is literally just gonna go and, like, look around the corner. Where do you think you peeled him? I would love some thematic like you scalped him. Or you took like one side of his abs or something. You know, If Noah is attacking from the side, that's gonna be a as close to the kidneys as she can do.

49:56

So like the entire side under his arm is probably just completely flounced. So like a flank, like like a backstrap. Yep.

50:09

Here, Precision attacking what suggest that you would try and gouge into the kidney and then pull open along the bone. That was really specific. What did you say? Your job was Abby.

50:29

Researching interesting ways that people can die, Mr. Mark, I work I want insecurity.

50:41

Just yes. No, Nope. Looks like a standard wooden door on that that frame. Gotcha.

50:54

And other than that, she's just kind of like peeking around. Looking around looks punishment. I think up stuff. Okay, you though. I haven't description for this area here. Yeah. Good about you. So he's gonna get up and private store, there's the send to a pair of alkrobes blinking, in an underneath, double door standing in.

51:23

Each alko was a bronze statue, depicting. A warrior dress in the ornate garb and armor of a warrior of distancia. Beneath their broad helmets, the statues where demonic faces was snarling, feigned mods While their hands clutch gracefully curved swords and posts of battle.

51:46

Okay. So Shoko's gonna look up koia and ask, Hey coin. You think you could save this guy from the best store? Yes, I would appreciate it. Koya, he's beyond my skills. Closer at the guy, now that he's near him. How old does this guy? Look.

52:15

That's a question. Give me a knowledge. Local.

52:28

Can I roll that one also? Yeah, I can't imagine you guys are openly familiar with the aging process of trolls.

52:41

Well he it does he really look like a troll or just troll bitch? But no, he looks like a very small troll, but if you were to put it into human years, he's probably early 20s. But with the natural regenerative abilities, that trolls have aging like humans do is not really a thing for them, but you haven't seen him regenerating any damage would, I would, I be able to tell the difference between like a troll and like a half troll or

53:20

Well astrals aren't really a thing. They aren't, they're not. It's all like, have I know like half ogres or a thing. I mean, there's always the possibility that he's a rarity but the possibilities are very minut.

53:50

That I yeah I guess that stuff goes term need to well no I didn't actually do anything but Shoko will go to the store and try to open it.

54:01

That door is locked.

54:08

I guess. Let it start. Great thing. I jumped his loops in the discord. Yep, I already got it on it. Present sees of that door is locks charger. Open it. That's what I guess of. Just oh, forward. Did we already determine if this store was locked? Nobody looked at Lord.

54:38

I don't believe she opened it. She hasn't look at in detail. Now cruising just opens it boxes and sex lie neatly snacked from this chambers. Don't holding orderly bins. Have been built into the walls. He wouldn't lockers stands beneath the shelves, quite the seeming order to this room bait Arnold Rink underlies.

55:03

The place have more Christian will start ransacking the room for stuff, okay? That will take a little bit of time. It is mostly quality spices.

55:32

And cost it. Here we go call these spices in the seasonings, imported from Tianzia and the locker beneath the shelves, holds the carcasses of game animals. And even the limbs of a few humanoids in various states of decomposition, grew delicacies for an Onis palette.

55:52

And aside from the various spaces, which they don't give me number of sort. You find the things that are obviously worth money. Alcohol. Oh, there's a lot of the spices. That's very fun.

56:18

I don't want him to die but I don't necessarily want him awake and escaping either. Then you must choose then wake him up.

56:40

Shoko. Wake him up, shoko bound, his hands and feet. Correct. Yeah, we're just his hands.

56:54

And I want to make sure his hands and feet are bound and he doesn't have his stuff on it and if he's oh, that's well, they're both found. Yeah. Okay. Then he's not dying now. Correct, because it got magical healing. Is he stable? That is correct and he stops bleeding and he's unconscious and he's unconscious at negative one.

57:12

Cool, we're leaving them there. Mission accomplished. The banner comes down. We'll grab him on the way out or I will if no one else feels the need to do. So what do you plan on doing with emoji? I want to speak to the man that he tortured by poisoning him while keeping him captive and get his opinion.

57:38

But primarily I believe, I want to turn him over to the proper authorities, People who want to fight to the death will choose to live and die that way. But this one, his life was important to him. And he can answer for the things he's done. And keep that life?

57:57

No, he cannot, he was not wrong. He opens were kill him. We're not turning them over to the Daniel. Like I said they're going to kill him. The moment they see what we can consult. The gentleman that he that suffered under him and see if he had major idea claim.

58:15

We're good when he can explain that. To me He's not dying right now. That's what's important to me. If whatever, way the people treat criminals here is how they treat criminals, then he should still answer for it in the proper channels. We don't cut down people in cold blood, but we in the habit of sparing necromancers, Um, I he had a wand and a scroll, he was not actually a practicing neighborhood.

58:55

The guy was in a corner surrounded by a bunch of You saw how with these fucking skeletons work instead? He's not a fighter. Ah, no way. Did you smell a locked door? I was just about to come follow. You not as saying absolutely nothing. While you guys are having this wonderfully in-depth conversation about morality.

59:17

She is ignoring you outright and is noting that you seem to have avoided this door. So if she gives it a look over and doesn't in fact, like kind of sniff it. A bit-ups. Is it locked? Let's try it. Is it gonna explode? I need to know. I need to know these things more, I don't know.

59:36

Let's try out. Mmm shoko. Tried it. It didn't open, and it didn't explode. Okay, then

59:47

Squints.

59:55

This, That is a one. I am back to form my looks fine. You usually want to see it, come back around, but you you both terribly in this campaign? No, this is actually fairly normal. I have I have a really, really bad string of looking Pathfinder. Don't know. Why really does?

01:00:24

I really do. I don't know, looks alright to me. So if it's just locked,

01:00:37

That's Wait, we're not in combat, right? Or anything, I'm not being pressured. No, talk me. 29, doesn't open it.

01:00:54

You.

01:00:59

Do the thing and voila.

01:01:05

It. Yes, it does actually turn

01:01:22

Matt, sorry, it was like

01:01:44

Exactly clicked on another map. So it's loading that other map. Now.

01:01:59

Man at the store opens. I was just gonna peek her head and if she doesn't see anything that looks like Kim and nuts or Mako, she's just gonna go back to wondering around and trying to figure out where the fuck people are.

01:02:30

While we're standing here watching. No way. Open this door, I'm gonna drink a potion.

01:03:03

It unlocks.

01:03:09

Cool ducks. Adam. Not sure how I'm going to do this. Oh yeah. Yes I am. I know I'm gonna do this.

01:03:24

This is not actually coming from Korea.

01:03:29

Oh dear.

01:03:46

Are all gathered around the store. Yep, It's indeed.

01:03:57

Oh, I think there's some Russian places back there. I got to go. Grab gotta do inventory. Gotta, Why are you not working?

01:04:15

Sure, that's fine. No, he's going good. She'd see if there was anything behind and then I get cut off. Yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm not even gonna justify that in character, just What do you want me to do? Shut goes, cut off with a needle in his throat.

01:04:41

Or is it fireball maybe? Fireball. Now it is fire. You're right. Oh no it's not. Fireball it tricks. It trips a tripwire that connects all the way back to the glass case of hell wasps. Don't even joke, manifest.

01:05:05

And then the rest of this, AP is no longer about getting to mean Kai. It's just like the snail meme, where we just have to outrun the hell wasps for the rest of our lives. I like the idea of opening a door and being told that a tripwire strips and then not being told what it did and then we go through the rest of the bottom floor.

01:05:27

You just hear you on me and we're like, all right, we could finally go and then we come up to the top floor and the bees are waiting for us like right outside and then campaign over. Yeah, pretty much.

01:05:46

The only one in fact, I hate it would thanks.

01:05:54

Sorry, listen. Now remember Helgerval is the only smart one. He's 25 feet away. 30 feet away, while the rest of you were having a wonderful conversation about the moral quandary of keeping alive and asshole. That was clearly working with or in service of if there's meadows.

01:06:25

If we just killed everyone associated with the frozen shadows, this would be a different party. It did not work or the spell is not working. For some reason, her hands asked, what spelling are you trying to guess? It's its plane shike. Hello, Patrick of requires you to put a, a template down but if you try and cash that I know I'm trying to

01:07:01

That's the nasty fell Also. Hey pain, pain agony. Oh, but only Casterville belief. Oh, only and New York now. It is it is super out. I like the idea though of like O2 calling Illinois, like, hey, could you deal with the story? Yeah, sure parks orchie.

01:07:37

Formula. And,

01:07:45

The formula was in wrong, and it's centered on the door. Oh, great. All that effort. And all that moral quandary for this dude is still die. Oh, just for that dude to incinerate. I'm sorry. Does that reflex DC? Correct. Replace. No. It's socially 17. Oh, just yeah. So he is fine.

01:08:17

Yeah, let me Grayson is also, I believe fine, get rid of that but and we'll just draw a manual template, though. It's just oh, gee annoy.

01:08:39

Okay. Okay, so I just get my eyebrows in just a little. Oh that's about right and the DC is 17, not 30. Sorry. I was trying to rush repair the trap. Yeah so you you say no like open this door and then basically catch flame and she's just sort of like just blasted in the face.

01:09:03

Staggers back falls through a knee and the entire front of her is just flat.

01:09:13

Little spicier than you thought. Huh. Why have anything little other thing? But we're the hell am I at if I could stab you? I always the only one, Maybe it's best if you just rest a moment Sequoia and Grayson and Zeo. Who's here now, who's starts pulling out? We've got seven potions of pure light moves.

01:09:39

Yeah, I have a couple as well. All hand one to no way. Let me figure out how to do that.

01:09:52

We have a wand of pure moderate, okay? Yeah. That's that's probably easier. Play a purchased it with her sharefoot. I give you a cure light. You can drink that cure light. Well, I mean, I think I think just be charges in the wand is probably the best idea one to 50 charges after all.

01:10:13

Yep. And she's already gone through 10 of them already for you guys.

01:10:23

Are you okay? I'll open the next door. You can stand back the door opened.

01:10:36

Shoku will walk in the door, that's no way. Still on the ground, just nearly good. Store is a very okay of valuable gathered into one place. Has overflow with gold and silver ornaments crates. Hold trade bars of precious metals or Nate. Gilded drinking parts, peeked out of burlap sacks and cover this bill forth with gold and silver coins and quantities rarely seen in this part of the world.

01:11:03

Obviously, it's all back here against the wall. Recent starts. Drooling Shopko will take something out of its pack. Just like a random thing and just throw it at the at the treasure board to like another trap Grace is in front of you and he explodes now it goes back to staggering off.

01:11:28

Yeah. Oh, she's gonna roll her perception in here before we get too close.

01:11:38

You buy nothing else off about this room. Big shoko will walk forward alone. This time pick up the thing he threw and examine on the treasure put more closely. It just posted it all because yeah that's all in here. There's a lot.

01:11:58

Busy for a couple minutes. Guys, I got typing to do. Oh, so happy. I don't do this with a skin. So beautiful. Find all of Amico's belongings in a chest and all of what looks like another adventurers. Belonging.

01:12:18

Including her rapier her Wanda, she also is a wander to your mother, everyone's 25 charges on it. And the one that identify or holy symbol of Shaolin, her signet ring her saw mission.

01:12:39

Her armor her ring of protection. It looks like they stripped her to the very basis as much as Ochi would love to say, I grab amigo stuff. In case we get to her. I don't, I can't hold like, more than five pounds more than I'm currently holding stored with her stuff.

01:13:00

Are some goggles. Snowshoes looks like a bunch of survival stuff. Cold weather gear. A beautiful long sword well-made men's work wouldn't shield and a tiger.

01:13:19

This looks to be a mako's things and maybe another person's probably prisoners. Could be off. Yeah, that's what it looks like. This will come in very handy and financing our way to Tiansha

01:13:41

Well, let's keep going. I think we'll have to come back and gather it up later though. It's a lot of way. It's a lot of weight Coco nods. Oh, she's gonna check on this dude again before we continue forward and just make sure he's still breathing and see if he's I feel like getting stronger looking any stronger perception.

01:14:01

On him is wounds have not healed and iota save for what Coya did Cool. And we're gonna keep walking then.

01:14:13

Ocho kicks. Open that door.

01:14:19

And then keeps walking, Can you hit us with the staircase description that you gave away earlier? One more time, I can indeed, We're always in this room, more, loot, the spices and the legume in legs and cowl legs and stuff. For the human lakes. You said humanoid there were it looks like they're in fact some humanoid things in there, you know, the turkey leg that we buy at the red fair that but like people and gonna stick.

01:14:48

Yeah, deep fried lake dog. The box of legs.

01:14:59

Okay. Then, how is this? How are these doors going to explode on there Unless we find another pile of gold? I think you might be pretty safe. That was the first time we've seen something like that pile. Up friends. Get in close for the explosion. Oh my goodness. We're gonna take our break here, so that crazy can do with counting stuff, too.

01:15:23

Already got that. Done for smells like it. So for two snack way, putting your break here. Sounds good. Okay. Look at it daily. You're doing nothing. Well, and I am ordering food because I am angry at that.

01:15:49

I am using a new headset. So, tell me if the volume of my gang comes through on like the mic at all. I want to make sure it doesn't, it shouldn't? But,

01:16:23

Next level I get my Next necromancy. Spell from my list. I'm wondering what I should take.

01:16:33

Is there a place where I can find spells listed by school? Yeah, you can do possible which class.

01:16:48

And no passing class at second level and six level. And then type level B20p SRD separates Wizard out into schools, All right, You can also do the whole thing here on I'm hungry.

01:17:12

Those archives of methods Archives. You can just it tends to be a little slower. And clunk together about system. Just pulling like individual ones and won't separate it by level, unless you distinctly, tell it to between here on on a country. You can do the same.

01:17:34

You're going toward hit the necromancy and boom. It won't do all spells for it really? Yep, I'd be so nice.

01:17:48

So it will, That is really cool and then just go back. And then Every time I learn something new about boundary, I'm just like this thing is so nice.

01:18:23

Does that music coming through it? All in my end or No, no, okay.

01:18:42

I didn't realize I have no circle small but you are. In fact.

01:18:54

And again, that's bigger than your heroes and all three times. Yeah. Yeah that's a it's a good thing.

01:19:05

I've got one second level spell left and four first.

01:19:56

Oh, so plenty. Yeah, just looking at the Wizard smell list on d20. I can already tell it's not complete because it doesn't have the one. I didn't see this in pair of campaign. I'm not delicious from like a weird. Look on it. Yeah, but so, you know,

01:20:23

A little go back to Netflix actually no uncle you said I could do it on the boundary you said earlier? Yeah, I don't know. Come from cups. Looks wine. Yeah, that isn't

01:20:48

Does everybody back already? Implying we ever went. I haven't left yet because I'm permanent ordering food. Mmm. I cast dog, baby and girlfriend. And now I have candy because it's Halloween season. I love fall though. I love fall so much reflecting this. Did you do it in that order?

01:21:13

Um, girlfriend baby, dog. Then candy. I'm gonna go out here. I have to do that carefully because, you know, I'm a white person. So, I open mouth. Kiss my dog. So I can't really do that. And then kiss the baby.

01:21:34

Silence.

01:21:39

Gen. I don't know. I got it. It was just eating salad. Yeah, it's gonna let that monster. I didn't know if you guys took me fully seriously. So I was like, okay now they know now. They know you're weird.

01:22:05

I'm excited to play Jorgen after I die in this fight.

01:22:11

Just, oh, she's dead body, like should we bring him back? And everybody's like, no, I would bring out some back. Grayson in away would be like I am so tired of arguing with them. He's in a better place. Hey Grisham, we have a moral quantity. I'd be like I couldn't pick a complex, so many arrows.

01:22:42

That's so many different. What are the arcane classes? Is its Wizard sorcerer but it torture, that's it, that's it. Okay. And then there's which

01:22:58

Which is just cool wizard. Which one? Which is cool. Wizard. Yeah. Good point, stop.

01:23:55

Stuff. I do. Apologize into the extremely goddamn late. That's fine. It's not that big deal. You just dodge the flame strike. He was actually sitting by the entire time just waiting for something that he could come in afterwards. So you wouldn't have to get hit by that. It can show you my look, I've get but

01:24:28

He was just doing the the bougie, Darth Vader where there's, he was standing in the back and there's no wind but he was using magic to make his cloak move in the win.

01:24:41

Basically back like how do I have almost hit points out of they get was breathing.

01:24:58

Two more than me.

01:25:06

Putting it. I'm a G8 class with not particularly high constitution.

01:25:16

I mean, are kind of about the same?

01:26:39

And returned and I ordered by two.

01:27:01

With my food and getting here in the next like 20 minutes and I had disappeared for a minute. You'll know why? That's fair. Buddhis important.

01:27:15

Very much that reminds me. I gotta do that yet.

01:28:07

Aware. Sorry about that in Quebec.

01:28:20

Remixing. Anyone.

01:28:25

Hi there, you fans.

01:28:30

I just need to payment. It's back. Thank you For Thursday game. And for today, here extra and we rather active will be now.

01:29:13

What? But this party loop cell total in the loop sheet. That is so much money. I'm gonna buy so many Ravens. A lot of stuff that is like crate goods and such that aren't the half price. Yeah, I guess everything's into account that you're also funding. The Caravan. All right, they give you more.

01:29:44

It's the same as over and rest of the righteous where we got all of that money. But then immediately got a city that we had to rebuild. So Sandrew who just sits around drinking and eating turkey legs at the caravan all day is like I need 10,000 gold to keep this train rolling.

01:30:04

I like just but that is just in the middle of while. He's really just stops dead stark and discourse and you 10,000 goal him him and like all 10 or 12 or whatever of the orphan Raiders. That we hired, they just sit around drinking and eating all day and gambling with each other and they're they gonna get we're gonna get 20 miles up towards the crowd of the world and they're gonna be like, sorry we're out of money.

01:30:29

You need to pass more, which reminds me. I did buy Sandra a present and I still haven't given it to him. I keep forgetting every time we're with him.

01:30:45

You also don't really spend much time with Sandru in this book in general, unless you specifically break them with people that he stabs instead of healing. So sorry. And sometimes in the entire Coya keeps me alive. Sandrew makes me look bad. So, he has to stay with the caravan.

01:31:11

What about? That's really funny to me. I'm sorry, this way, bad. His hair is so luscious. I am dude. He's a handsome. He's got a good job. You know. It's got a good relationship with his adoptive mother. He's really the dream, man. He doesn't think no.

01:31:38

So, how long have you been having these feelings? Okay, no, I'm gonna. I'm gonna hook it up. I'm a bro. I'm gonna have my little pet bird and mind my business. Are you telling me that you are in fact, his I'm a child. Thank you very much. I am underage Actually, no majority is probably what you thought that, that's what I meant, which concerns me far.

01:32:01

More majority is probably a little bit younger for Tangu because they have like a two-thirds BAB lifespan compared to pretty much everybody else or three quarters BAV. Yeah, they're like old ages like 70 or something like that. They start dropping off at 70. The way you described it though.

01:32:21

He wants baby lifestyle is I'm stealing that one. Thank you. You're welcome. I need, I didn't realize, I needed that. I didn't know how else to describe it. But yeah, I thought about that a lot when I did not hear your genius, I'm just ranting. Like I do just saying tangos, don't live that long, we're debating, whether it's appropriate for me to discuss how handsome and and eligible.

01:32:47

I think Sandra is being that I'm like 17. I mean, insane years ago in 3.5 for addition where one of the players was playing a fight cream and I think they only live to like 15 20 years or something like quite sure. And the guy who was DMing that we finished, well we thought was committee.

01:33:12

He was like oh we actually got a bit more. So there's a 10-year age gap and then the players doing that like penis like oh all right. Well, I guess I'm playing my character's son then, but

01:33:30

My father, got all these stories about you. Yeah, exactly. Which we can just carry on like I'm him if you want, you can even call me his name. Yeah. Doing the beer fest. Yeah, I am busy Jr. Please refresh to me, as PC name. Only you can even call me his name.

01:33:49

That makes you guys. Feel more comfortable. Watch the lately reasonably you. We did that same joke a while back. And I really thought about rewatching it. I've been watching a bunch of scary stuff. My girlfriend loves spooky stuff and it's spooky season so it's sure it's true 'tis. The season.

01:34:05

Newbies spooky. Deep protein still only live that long even in their most modern iteration to think don't even know what that is. What is that for Friday? What race lethariking? He said, Yeah, I have no idea what then the fifth edition with their stuff in this, Most recent one I see is their lifespan was increased to 35 years.

01:34:35

Hmm.

01:34:43

That I could be wrong. I don't really check the unity so that anymore Not to get off on the tangent again. But has anybody played two? He at all and other feelings about it. I started looking through the Ruby tournament books But I can't say I really understand the system yet.

01:35:03

I haven't really looked through the players tag. Yeah. Okay. In, I played and I played a couple institute. It's it's it's okay up until you come across creatures that, if you create them, they do nasty stuff. Like on being crate, they do something. Yeah. Huh. Like that. They're interested adults.

01:35:31

No, no, there is no crit builds anymore because you can only crit on the net. 20 or hitting and racing above 10? I won't lie. The fishes are basically fighters now, right? Hmm. No, there is no crit. There are there is no quick picture. No I I know but the concept of hitting critical hits like on a regular basis.

01:35:52

Basically falls into fighters because fighters get base proficiencies higher in the weapon fields that they choose ability. Yeah, yeah yeah. So if you want to critical it, oh you're more likely to be a fighter as they like as they port more stuff over. Like I'm intrigued because the action economy is something that really like attracts me to possibly switching because like I've had very limited experience with this but like already at level you know six I'm like I can see how it's like five foot step attack, five foot step attack you know like you can get more creative than it but like the the action economy is pretty restrictive.

01:36:30

If you want to be effective a second edition, Pathfinder by myself. Yeah, there's a lot more. So builds I don't really a thing. I mean, yes, they are in so far that you can make choices and have character ideas and such. But it is more about the choices that you make incompact rather than like, oh, I'm going to do this particular thing on like this is going to be my answer for 95% of my encounters.

01:37:00

Like that's yeah, the action economy because it's effectively the Pathfinder and chain section economy which I did play basically an entire camp panel is much better. I would argue that base stuff. The only time it has problems in first edition, when you try and use the unchang one, is the moment you start having shit like Magi The moment a maggots hits the table, I immediately throw out any idea of using engine like into the nether place it fucks with those those builds that need things like switched actions to specifically boost stuff so badly.

01:37:40

It hurts them so much. I see I just like I've I've heard enough Pathfinder played or watched enough, Pathfinder plate and played enough. Now to know like if you're not built to do the thing like you can't really do the thing like you get grappled by somebody who's a grappler like now you just get hugged for a while, you know, most simplistic description of Pathfinder build yet.

01:38:05

So apt, I think you could have possibly done. I've heard like a lot of It is very library now. Yeah, which like, I love the game, like, the amount of customization, like I've read through, like, DPD, whatever it is. The the knot is good reference and archives like so much wanting to play for so long.

01:38:28

I like the amount of options and the number of ways that you can like build a character concept is amazing. And if it just had like a little bit better action economy and like, I don't know, maybe a good marketing team, I think everybody would be playing it because like, I hear people play, I listen to a couple of like regular D&D whatever.

01:38:47

The fifth edition is the one that everybody's playing and it makes me want to throw up when they're just like you get a plus five because bless and you also get to roll 2d 2020s and take the better. And like, that's it. And I've heard it doesn't like scale as much with, like, leveling.

01:39:03

And I'm like, that's like anti-RPG, you know what I mean? Every RPG has ever, played is always like finder didn't take off. Like is because the marketing people that Paizo are words for stupid that I'm not allowed to use without being offensive. That's very, they are disagree about it.

01:39:24

I do that. I was marketing. Team are interesting. You know why critical role of 5e, right? No because Wizards effectively pitch them because of because Matt Mercer was playing a pathfinder one E game with his friends. And he called piezo and said, hey, can we turn this into like a stream show?

01:39:47

And Paiso was like, fuck off. And so, Matt was like, all right, we're going to 5e. Then this horse right? Yeah, that was yeah, to think that I was initially like, they were actually pretty fucking good at the entire reason, why not mess around having to convert the gunslinger, which is now, like a common fit edition tie.

01:40:06

And the people I didn't even know, I didn't even know that they were originally in Pathfinder when they were playing it like just for them. That's awesome. And super cool. It's and makes me mad at Paiso because the podcast that I listen to is the glass cannon podcast and they're now the official like Pathfinder podcast people and they kind of fumbled it as well.

01:40:28

I've been frustrated with them because now they're like diversifying into all these other games. And I want to say it's just because like nobody wants to play that later. I think it's Pizos fault. You know, like everybody's racist against pathfinder. I think a lot of it Unfortunately comes down to the fact of, despite the fact that Pathfinder is very as a game, like I I've sold it through a couple of my friends where I've gone like, hey, you want to know why I don't play for the mission, because I play this for their edition, that I'm far more familiar with because I have years of experience in it, but more importantly, to me, if I want to do something like, give me a character concept and I will tell you in 30 seconds, whether or not I can make a character that can functionally do what you're talking about because the rules already exist for that fit the edition.

01:41:20

I don't like yeah. Um, both in front and behind screen because so much of it is in the DM's hands because there's so much of it. That's basically, oh, UDM. Just kind of wings it for like, what this value is, or this is not fine, but then, but I play with people that have very good memories for that kind of thing.

01:41:37

And a few houses something that wanted, but you can expect that to be the household. Rather, that's right. And that's that's like cool. The government discovery whatsapp fiber was basically the same thing where he told me Name me official character and I will make you better character. Pathfinder function, right?

01:41:55

Superman. Do you want to play Zeus? Do you want to play Gambit from the X-Men? I can make you that character the it's actually a rarity these days that I get like a character connecting people with build tonight and like character concept ideas, relatively easily. I got entire hold of them and it's very rare that I come across like an idea where I don't think of like, oh, this is the path that you have to kind of go, which is why some people do relatively call it feet finder.

01:42:24

Because you know, about 400, I don't want to say it's eight seven, which is a very different website and player base. Oh, because I asked him. The first thing I wanted to play. I was played Final Fantasy 14 at the time and so I wanted to play a Dragoon like I wanted to play it again.

01:42:47

I wanted to do the impacts and all that and so I can hear you right now, if they will allow it, you could have put you could you could do it from a three five chance you can kind of do it in a Pathfinder one depending on how you want to swift dragonfly style but yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

01:43:10

A lot of it is like charging stuff in dreams are are kind of a weird one because you have to you have to decide on what I'll expect of it. You want to be with that because you can't functionally do all of it Because magical side of it. Do you want?

01:43:26

Yeah, exactly. Do the magic side. You want the Marshall side. You want the ability to be able to jump, really fast, part of your thing. You want to be able to like you want to be in armor, you know. Is that what you is? A tragic in hindsight because he's like well if you want to be dragged themed and you want to be able to get the high places like you could be a Drake writer And so we have walked up on the tree writing cavalier which is like one of the least efficient subclasses of the game it.

01:43:57

Yeah. But it does do exactly what it says in the ten. Just, I would argue better ways to do or spinning of suddenly off the top of my head. If I'm brutally honest, I would actually argue that. Estonian is probably a blood various so fast somewhere. A lot of the Dragon Bay out of this.

01:44:14

He brought up here you go. First one proud of you get out of here either like he's probably a fighter cavalier Food Ranger something in the depending on how far you want to go down the dragon path. Potentially, you could even argue like if you wanted to go, the Ishqadian root of, you know.

01:44:32

Oh, they're all actually secretly dragging people. You could even make an argument for going drag at the cycle but that's the pendant on how far down that particular spread you wanted to go. I definitely would however he has to be like, okay but what aspect of that character? Do you like him?

01:44:49

What do you want to continually be good at You want like the AoE dives, then we need to start looking at some other stuff, that's a little bit more out there, but we'll definitely do what you want. Like I would argue that dragon fire dive, but founders are the I was about to cut everybody off because it was my fault.

01:45:10

But you know, you guys I don't even know about Final Fantasy. So, I was like, if you enjoy it, you enjoy it. It seems like a great conversation to have after the session. Yes, sir, I know. Yeah, I'm sorry. I thought we were still on the break. This Didi in here.

01:45:27

Cool, I'm here.

01:45:32

All right then, let's get back. Let's get another flame. Strike. Going Everybody get really close to the doors. Oh, that was the thing. Could we get the text for the stairway and the statues and everything again?

01:46:00

There's the sin to a pair of alcoves blinking, an ornate double door standing each alcove, as a bronze statute depicting, a warrior dressed in the ornate. Garban armor of a warrior of distancia beneath their broad helmets, the statute, where demonic face masks was snarling fanged models while their hands clutched.

01:46:19

Graceful curved swords and poses of battle Is there like a knowledge? Check to like identify? What? These are or like, it looks like ownies. Yes. Spookiness right up here. Everybody Grayson, can you see anything weird about these maybe like a secret switch or something?

01:46:50

24 26. If it's what stonework. What are your dwarf? I see.

01:47:00

Still snowing as far as the ice can see. I mean, what do you looking for? We're just percepting this area. The statue seemed cleared, huh? But if they're just statues and they're just statues. Well, open the doors. Oh hi! It's the lady.

01:47:27

You come? You knew we would Where in OT steps in, don't go to. Where is she? If I told you that the last Scion of House Ahmadatsu was hanging from the back lift with the rope swinging against the blade about coming to her doom.

01:47:57

Is a is this the clip I think outside?

01:48:07

It's just the room you've just found yourself in that was a sentence fragment just FYI. I hate those, The interior of this chamber has been transformed into a multi-level architectural. Wonder the chamber is divided into two tiers, The upper tier line, 20 feet above the lower tier and rotated 45 degrees.

01:48:29

The peak of the ceiling rises to a pyramid, 60 feet above the floor, The diagonal orientation of the upper tier forms four, Funky foot high ledges above the walls, of the lower tier, a fountain issues from the southern and most of these ledges boring into a waterfall to a decorative pool.

01:48:48

In the floor. Containing several ruby. Huge koi, black leggard folding screens have been set at various places about the room. Creating what could be a gradable maze of panels? I and white visualize that and the map is not helping. Now the map is not great for what they expect to be.

01:49:13

Yeah, we have the draw tool. We could draw some of these wedges and such in here.

01:49:30

So,

01:49:37

Just let me show you actually. This will probably help.

01:49:49

Oh I see. So these are 20 feet up and the room goes for a total of 60 feet up into a pyramid So it's like a weird combination between a Rubik's cube and a pyramid. We are on the bottom of the square, but like, halfway up the Rubik's cube, the broom is rotated.

01:50:10

So that these little jutting out triangles are ledges, they're 20 feet higher than us. Right. And like around our little leopard screens, I didn't actually mean to draw that one. Did I manage to delete it? Or did you?

01:50:30

How do I delete this one?

01:50:34

So go back to the drill tools, select it and press. Delete magic, don't bunch up by the way.

01:50:52

And then are these smudgy looking deals. The, I think those were supposed to be the screens

01:51:05

Because it is full of, you know, those Asian styled lacquered screens people use, the separate rooms because rent is expensive.

01:51:19

And there are Several beautiful Ruby koi in the fountain in front of her. Okay. And then let's she was saying, what would you say if I told you, let me go was hanging off of a cliff with a blade about to cut the rope right now, right? Yeah, the cliff on the back.

01:51:42

She said, correct.

01:51:50

I mean, she just said claim, Okay, but outside.

01:51:57

Could be would be more than likely.

01:52:04

Can we incite her to standpointing? She's lying.

01:52:12

I mean, she asks you a question.

01:52:20

Why not kill her before now? Then if you, if that's what you're playing, was reason I didn't even say that she was hanging up of a cliff with a rope attached to her.

01:52:40

I really want to kill you. I know, I know.

01:52:50

Why are you doing this?

01:52:57

Let's kind of science of mankai, must all be eliminated. Let's back up a step. Where is a Maaco? That I will be keeping secrets for myself for now. Okay, well, you'll be much less likely to kill me if you get the advantage, if you don't know where she is.

01:53:18

That's fair. Let's make a deal. Why don't you write it down? And then that way, after we kill you, we can know where she's at. And I will make this a lot easier. Probably would. Yes.

01:53:39

OT draws a swords.

01:53:45

Still go. Awesome it. Well, no, I already have my month of

01:54:02

Is she just on the ground floor with us? It looks like she's standing in front of her Quaker.

01:54:19

Okay, I'm back. I'm sorry, Welcome back.

01:54:26

If anyone else has some RP, they want to do with this lady. Because now is the time because show goes about to start casting kimon Dotsu and he points assorted her, you will tell us where a Mako is and you will release us. You release her to us or you will die in this room today and that's a challenge.

01:55:00

So well, you guys are talking because I didn't want to interrupt them with that. No, it doesn't another ever hand symbols vanishes for a bit? And as she comes into this room, grabs a hold of her links clasp and just crushes. It, Is there anything invisible in here?

01:55:26

There is.

01:55:34

Yeah.

01:55:38

I would like to have this while you guys working, but I see that that is not going to be a thing Wookie.

01:55:49

I mean we have we had quite a bit of a conversation. There was like if nobody had done this from right from the start, then I you guys busy talking and I didn't want to interrupting. No, you can totally do that for the future. So, roll it.

01:56:09

I'm doing whatever. I'm not are you can keep doing your actions. She was waiting for at least one more person to come inside the room. So I'm confused because we see it or you saying that that hasn't happened yet and how does no way? See that was the spell invisible.

01:56:27

What I'm hearing is somebody here can see invisibility and therefore was waiting for people so that you could fire us. I'm going to take a guess and the illusionary version of her. You were talking to vanishes. I think we learned she could see invisible when we fought her at the the guilt.

01:56:49

Alright, so we all make reflexes that is correct. I tried clicking it. It didn't do anything.

01:57:05

Okay. Okay. Those are supposed to be your good saves. Oh my god. Game really wants us today. Wow.

01:57:22

Boom, you'll be happy to know. She only has one of those. So I think we all failed. Nope. Zeo you made it three places. 18. Oh wow. Do we have to many thing? We could do here any any way to modify rules afterwards? Anybody. No, he just got to eat it.

01:57:47

It also didn't apply the damage for me when I clicked on it.

01:57:53

That is weird of half a 34/17 - 12,

01:58:03

Yeah. But what's your I think you said you were in Asmar cold resistance. Nice. So what I'm hearing is, you take very little damage from her attack, very little because I didn't save on it, and I only have common five and her eyes narrow at you.

01:58:30

Choco did you not take it? No, I took it hard. I'm just double-checky to see if I have anything that can I couldn't remember of not unless you took that one board spell, but allows you to retractively add like a plus one competence as an immediate action. Again, technically, that's a problem I could run for.

01:58:57

I couldn't remember if there was anything I could do with the block butler I bought maybe a like a gave you a bonus. Deer reflex speeds of international or something, sounded like something that you do. But okay, so 37 for 34 34. Okay, I'm not. I'm a 13. Help mileage.

01:59:19

You know, that's a second level of

01:59:25

Popular ability. Nimble on life? Yeah, trying to life. Sorry, I only have for one level one software.

01:59:43

You.

01:59:49

But just she is visible now. Which is not still invisible. He is visible now. Why they roll twice from the hip? I do not know Initiative, too. Yay. Shoko is going to die before I even get to actually explain this back story. Yay. Yep. That's the danger.

02:00:16

Where the save notes that's about right somehow.

02:00:30

Oh well there's also a lot of ninjas which goes back to my initial question of there. Anything invisible in this room to which you went. Yes. And then I exploded, they're actually several other things visible to you. Abby. Oh dear.

02:00:55

So there are two ninja up on the ledge above you.

02:01:03

And then two ninja on the ledge up above. Oh, gee

02:01:11

This is already looking like a

02:01:17

Like, it depends on how you play it. And and unmodified encounter from the bush.

02:01:30

We had the explicit misfortune of all of us. Not rolling above a ten. Home is everyone on against a what it stage? Yeah. Anyway, why is my truck? Hey, I will move you. It's like,

02:01:59

At two tokens on the map.

02:02:13

All right, you're moving starts from there, awesome.

02:02:24

I am going to start this up. I guess helping her narrow, her eye of that me with a color tree to many. Think my life.

02:02:43

I'm here image. That's a, that's a nice for there. You rolled he know.

02:02:55

Bet that is probably gonna save your life, any movement.

02:03:06

Now, I like 16, right? Where I'm at. I'm trying to figure out what perfect I could throw on. That'll actually, you know,

02:03:19

Big. I think the Mirror image is going to do some. Do some work real? I thought that on it. So look me. So, take the dodgy.

02:03:37

And I take up none of the frozen ninjas with the radius of that giant attack. They run ledges. Yep.

02:03:52

But boom. Everyone said the ninjas didn't do well.

02:04:02

Hey, OG gonna hit your flat footage AC. Nothing looked like it. No button is 15. Yeah, it does.

02:04:18

Anything so that they're just think they're

02:04:27

He told my god, 14 in total isochi down. No OG's gonna spend an immediate action to stay up. Do you even have your media action on a surprise round? I think you should be able to. You can take Swift actions. No, you can't take immediate actions while you're like while you're flat-footed, then I'm not going to do that but I am gonna look it up, just to make sure but yeah, I'm down.

02:05:03

Yeah yeah please do come. I'm pretty sure. That's the, that's kind of the the grief.

02:05:12

And no way.

02:05:18

Yeah, you loudly here. All right, two ninjas know. It's two. Ninjas west, We actually for that.

02:05:30

And let me see what I actually have left in my tank because I'm pretty sure the answer is fucking nothing.

02:05:44

Well, that's one thing I was gonna do now, I can't because that would be suicide.

02:05:54

I have a very important question. These are these ledges? Yes, are the walls going up to them flat? Like are the international moves of it is a beautiful artistic broom with lots of geometric divines in the wall that one train such. As you can tell we're actually designed for rapid climbing.

02:06:21

Of course it was. This is a murder box. It is, isn't it? Hi married. Her box. We should probably read the murder box. Oh, I would think murder box is bad, Wouldn't you? So, is Ochi up or down? Oh, geez down. I can't get it to go to negative 1 for some reason.

02:06:47

But I'm at negative one. Yeah I am retreat is the metapod of valor in my case, close the alternative options are very very suicidal and I would have done them if I hadn't taken 34 in this age. So yeah, nor is not exactly a brave enough to do that and that trucks back.

02:07:10

And I guess chugs the one portion of your life. She has on her which let me guess. Does it doesn't get a man? Actually, I'm surprised chunk.

02:07:31

My old.

02:07:37

And goes invisible. Now, you can still see her. Yeah. While I would have told you to crack his links but he doesn't have. That was gonna be with all to do that. It's gonna be the first thing I did. He slides a little higher up.

02:08:02

Into this area. Okay, cool.

02:08:19

You see him land right in front of Shoko.

02:08:39

He misses, anyways.

02:08:52

Fire. I'll probably is probably low on channels, isn't she? But it has three channels left. Oh look, Grayson is her radius now. So she is gonna quick channel.

02:09:13

First channel.

02:09:18

It's good number.

02:09:23

That can channel. Let's also a good number.

02:09:33

And she hisses in Virisian, never can understand verse. And what does she say? You will not hurt my family but like, in a hexy sort of way,

02:09:54

Thanks mom.

02:10:02

You've never seen Koya with blood loves before. Oh, we got the lowdown on what an OMI can do earlier from the knowledge. Check What other spells does she have? Hi Invisibility. Will a harm monster. Beep. Slumber. Gaseous form and darkness. What is deep slumber? Is that an AOA? Boom.

02:10:30

It's the improved version of sleep and affects up to 10, hit days.

02:10:46

They are Gucci murder hobos. Yeah.

02:10:56

Was pulling this.

02:11:01

Great sin. Same. Come just barely but yes kind of forgot his the effect done. 4 point of sneaker tag. And then it is the Grayson's turn. Oh she can't use Dave Slumber very well on us right now because we're surrounded by her lackies. Would probably have less hypnotized than loss.

02:11:36

Does it seem like the group is wanting to back out of the room and kind of do more of a choke point style thing?

02:11:49

That's a shirt though, said, but I'm not sure we can drag emoji out of here, even with the human. He doesn't seem to be doing well. I mean, from,

02:12:05

There anything in the world to a worry about plus key so he's targeting the one that's just for the right associate.

02:12:23

And so day, we still dropped him. And five foot step to the top luck.

02:12:42

That was in an excellent choice sir.

02:12:48

Very active, never talk about.

02:13:00

We're Grayson.

02:13:09

Well, okay, here. And,

02:13:19

And we're very good importance to each other. Why is that not too easy?

02:13:32

Yeah. Library roll. I put in the wrong box. That's why it didn't winter So that didn't even hit him. I don't think I've got a reroll that entirely if it role to these things in there. Suddenly the previous September as well from the other guy. No, just this one.

02:13:54

Just this one.

02:14:03

Wow, That's just rude. Okay. Yes. Hands and consistency. Know you keep the first damage roll. Oh, no. Actually, that's the one. That's exactly. Maybe your opportunity stick on that on the Well yeah if he gets to sneak at that.

02:14:27

Okay. Pandemically. Oh yeah. Just keep that damage it OT. And OG curses very loudly. And a lot This is I I don't even want to be a ninja anymore. I hate all of you and he's going to stand up. Get stabbed maybe conditions. We're gonna take prone off. Do a swing you train?

02:15:08

That's no, I think so. That was a move actually. And so,

02:15:16

I'm going to swing on the one right in front of me.

02:15:24

Oh, geez.

02:15:38

What?

02:15:47

Does that hit?

02:15:52

It does it, cool. And then I think that's probably it. I'm going to look at my Swift actions real quick and see if there's anything I can do because we're oh, she is very, I mean, danger right now.

02:16:09

Yeah, no, I got nothing. That's my turn.

02:16:24

Oh, bringing us to Shoko. Do we still have blessed and heroism? I don't think I still have those going with. I don't know what heroes and I think right now would be video cornea and then I give him the other way. Oh, and I think You did give it to me at one point and they said, you said it was a really long duration.

02:16:52

Yeah. Okay, 15 minute. Hour drape. So, it feels like an uphold travel domain movement, what does that do again? That's coya's. Party buff. What about bless? I have bless. I'm assuming that's from Chloe. That's his only a minute. Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and take that off now. Inspire courage for us.

02:17:14

That will be my turn. I start up in fire, courage, and then

02:17:31

Work on the tankiest one, but step forward. What level is inspired courage supposed to be at. Now four, okay. Just making sure right now. And she would beautiful. Then what? I might a little more. Okay. Oh no, it's supposed to be five.

02:18:07

Yeah. Yeah. Fifth levels of another plus one.

02:18:16

Inspire courage by foot step forward and turn.

02:18:22

Boom.

02:18:32

All of a statues are alive. Yay. Why did you like to confused when we asked if there was anything weird about the statue? Because Grayson only rolled don't work. Grayson only rolled a 24. That's why.

02:18:52

Did they both come alive? The other one has bought yet. He is not acted.

02:19:13

New land turn.

02:19:29

Neo. So, I'm going to go ahead and

02:19:37

Is it everything for now? Let's check on the same. There is indeed, those are coming.

02:19:54

Of a rules. Android 6, you you still broke quite well. Actually you once read in scrolls that came all the way from Tianzia about a type of samurai guardian statue.

02:20:13

Harrieted column started.

02:20:23

Okay, Sands. Yes. I'm so sorry to interrupt when you roll the Shangham at me earlier. There's a private role right after that. Was that sneak attack dice on me? No. Okay, so it's just the four because I would have taken it because my AC is lower against everybody except Kim and Dotsu.

02:20:45

Oh, challenge, which is fine. I'm still up. Yeah. Did you challenge Kevin Dodson or did you challenge an illusion of giving dog food? It's effectively the same thing. I don't think I need to like see them. It was I know that they're there and I would have seen him right after it works on my evil rules so so I have no idea what those are.

02:21:05

But yeah, I was I kind of just assumed it was like we're in the same room. It's the same person. You need to see the target so you wouldn't have been able to challenge, right?

02:21:17

I mean, you're thinking of it more like a magical effect instead of an extraordinary ability. I'll read up. Let me worry about it. He has challenged her. She is here just because he's using deception doesn't mean he's any less challenged her. Yeah I think we can just apply a rule of common sense.

02:21:40

Here is we're talking about the same person in the same room, you know, for sure.

02:21:50

As I was in, they have immunities to magic like many constructs.

02:22:00

You remember reading that they were particularly acceptable to a rock to mud spell and they are not allowed of sitting through against it. You also know that it is said that any weapon striking them, if it is not powerful in the ways of magic will shatter

02:22:31

Is that magic? It just has to be a plus. One weapon. Or does it have to be something special? Yeah, special ability called cheddar weapons. Whenever a characteristically strikes, a column with a weapon magic nomad takes 3D, 6 points of damage, apply the weapons. Hardness normally, I'm sorry. Fuck this book, dude.

02:22:53

The secret door to secret door. Combo into the weapon destroying constructs in the boss fighter than normal heart. So the fluff that greater magical weapons aren't destroyed as just that it's flood.

02:23:15

Well, okay, so I'm pretty much useless again. Except for my one ability, You have some you have some like spells that are not saw. You've been using the letter dust below. Boom, That does. It is Sunday. AC Sonic's, always a good thing to use against constructs.

02:23:44

And then I was temp out. Well no, no actually no, I will say right where I'm at. You blow a solid chunk out of it.

02:23:58

The affect me one archaeological award.

02:24:06

And that's the end of my turn, Right? And I started six images below ninja tries to stability again. Oh gee. Why not me? Because he's gonna miss me. Anyways, Why would you sabot you when the person he's been trying to murder is still next to him? Okay. Yeah, that's a mess.

02:24:33

No way.

02:24:37

Okay, That's kind of fucking rude.

02:24:45

Poison them. That would be nice or not. No, No. I is still the kind of invisible, but the Florida directly where she stood. So many seems to have a lot of blood, net.

02:25:03

That just kind of seeps onto the ground around her feet. And oh we're gonna turn that on. All right. Kamikaze. The other regular ninja player like I know it's just yeah. I mean because it and though I didn't take that wrote that I needed out on ninja trick. But yeah, no is stupid but also has a reason why she has this one.

02:25:41

And yeah, you you haven't voiced anything about these constructs, right? No, she just he would have said everything that he knows about these contract. Fuck me then. Um,

02:25:58

So I'm gonna I'm just gonna show it. I got to ask about what what happens if if I just kick it. How does my leg explode?

02:26:14

It's very important question with the weapon. It's weapons specifically. So, your kicks will work amazingly. They might it does still have DR. So it does still have VR which sucks but my next question is can these things seen visible things and do they care about position and they are immune to mind effects.

02:26:40

They are full and construct. Okay. He so they can't be, sometimes They don't say anything on their sheet about being. If they're not immune to precision that they can be sneak attacked. It's something that changed from three five, a lot of things like skeletons and such can now be sneak attack.

02:27:03

They just have construct trades, okay?

02:27:13

In which case punch one. They see anything on here about being immune the precision damage partly immune to Chris. Yeah, she precisioned the hell out of them right now. I don't say anything other than being a means Christ either. Then they are susceptible to both and it's higher level constructs, typically that have those immunities to be clear lower level ones, like, animated objects, and such tend to not be.

02:27:41

Yeah. They are. They are standardly. Means all of the disease data bags, blah blah, and you'll damage on their own immunity to online effecting. Yep. So you you see this punch like go through its chest and broke my chatbark did, didn't it? Whoops, By the way down the comfort communities.

02:28:09

Yeah, sorry not. Sorry, fair there is there is a noise that next to you now that you can see, very clearly has a wide variety of like, and almost looks like scratches that have been etched into the skin, that are just very slightly seeping blood niggets worse, the lower down, her torso, it gets it looks suspiciously like a lot of the bookie asses that you guys have seen.

02:28:38

Oh, by the way, lawyers defect damaged It's all built in. Did not have sneak. No, you fix it. It shouldn't have sneak. Anyway, here visibility doesn't affect it. Okay. This is a mind effect. Invisibility is a glamor at the glimmer.

02:29:09

Visibility is an illusion Obama. It makes you invisible. It's a thing. You can see it's not think, appreciate sorry. You know what I mean? It's nothing. I guess. Climbers are the only things not on that list, okay? Yes. I mean, that's neat deck if if you would like it, Am I happy that this entirely scripted?

02:29:37

Oh, and modified. Always gonna near the night bought, it was gonna be yes, please roll your sneakers yet. An additional problem damage she fully this. Yeah. This this thing has a like a foot solidly in its pole. So you like omayani that thing when she popped up behind well God did yeah.

02:30:05

Yeah, pretty much. I can't remember when that that Mercenario's name was. But yeah, that you like fully just put a foot through it. Yep. And and five, another could be broker. Yeah. Yeah she retrieves her fist and it is covered in her own blood. That is present, but

02:30:35

We continue on video, you were not clapping against Tech. You know what they are? Oh,

02:30:46

But you do have more images and you have many images must be nice. Being aware of the attacks. So, here's the funny part because it does not confirm. That's good, that's good. So we're gonna say you're one, But when he said no one knee six, it didn't roll. It went anyways.

02:31:10

Pop some image unless you want me to reroll Now that's fine. It punched an image.

02:31:21

Now, I die. Give him. Send me over Jorgen's stats and I'll build them out. No way. You actually see her descend down a little bit. Mm-hmm. His her lips at all of her hard work being undone. Why does she have rapid shot? Because she's a fucking only.

02:31:51

Oh, thank god.

02:32:01

This is a second time. Koi has been hit with an arrow. Super hard. Yeah. A javelin size zero. This Koya have any sort of cover from being behind us and being behind. Coyas like our 50 cent, dude, she's gotten shot like nine times. Be really has. Did you know she has precise shots?

02:32:25

Yeah, we want to influence Koya to take monk levels so she can deflect arrows.

02:32:36

And Koya's flat footage Koya. The monk of Desna. I have characters and one who does not emotional. That's right, Deadpools and shadow. Now, it is close turn.

02:33:01

Going to use this on herself First because you always put your own air mask on first.

02:33:15

Give me a favor last and just get out of the way of the construct, so I could kick it.

02:33:24

So that's entirely fair.

02:33:31

But Praise in, love flap with it. I've ever tony misses you. You are after all a month. It's very difficulties On round two. You hear? I terrible sounding howl from somewhere but it seems to resound in almost bounce. Off of the, the corrugated walls of this room. And you hear in a very angry booming voice.

02:34:10

Yeah, man. That's you

02:34:18

And then what sounds like the sound of a blizzard and wrenching metal.

02:34:29

Jason.

02:34:35

Oh, look at him and daughter. How does she react to this? He does not have a happy. She actually might have a slightly scared. Look on her face.

02:34:54

Black Harris case is gonna do something just a tad bit different. It's gonna reach into his bag. And he's gonna pull out a metal object and he's going to just throw it on the ground and his square. He's gonna use that fugitives grenade, we just picked up off the troll.

02:35:20

And it makes a 10 foot radius fog cloud, that lasts for two reps. Little boom. I have just think of you.

02:35:55

One.

02:36:13

Both place sir. 10 foot readers? Yep, You would bought all vision through that door.

02:36:22

And then he'll But I guess I'll take a Hi. But step back and he'll say Rochi quick, we got it, we gotta get back through the door. At least she'll pick us off and that is his shirt.

02:36:51

I don't know.

02:37:06

Going to use smoke cloud. 2 is advantage.

02:37:16

Oh, gee OT is gonna back off but first, he's gonna take a swing at the ninja in front of him. Can I see it? I'm standing in the smoke cloud and he's out of it. Can I see him? Yes. No concealment not from where you are, okay?

02:37:48

Rough in sir.

02:37:53

And then oh gee, he's gonna run back there.

02:38:02

And that's gonna be his turn. Kind of thinker with that internet attacked in the sink. It will indeed. I can use acrobatics to avoid that. I have the movement. Give me that roll. I think my roles for this have been getting affected by Koya's buff. By the way, if I'm not mistaken I'll go check my sheet because it seems really high.

02:38:30

Well, you have the booty hell and cat. Yeah I do. Yep. Okay. Skill ranks class. Skill decks buff equipment, okay? And be happy that you had them. Kids that barely makes it

02:38:58

Yeah, and that's all I got for right now. I gave my last potion to no way earlier which I am incredibly grateful. She says as she's like believe everywhere from the scalp he's you know like as he stands next to her he's gonna tell her I really hate ninja.

02:39:24

How little birds aren't only chopped up to be either, son?

02:39:38

Oh,

02:39:54

I guess shortfall is going to go away. Wing struggle will go by 10.

02:40:11

Provoking from this guy as he wants to take a swing.

02:40:22

You don't think that promotes in just moving into this range? Not through it. No, no the potential. Oh yes the ninja. I was really confused there. First second.

02:40:40

If I will miss 19 up to this the statue. And, Well this is a magical weapon so it shouldn't immediately shatter. I'll take a swing. Oh wait, no. I need to get this yearbook. Shoko will take the total defense action, and stand its own dispatcher.

02:41:17

You that Samurai statue is dead.

02:41:41

Ladies fucking crazy.

02:41:48

Zeo Neo will use a arcade point to dimensional side behind OG? I think it has used its attack of opportunity against Gucci and it hasn't gone since then. The property we wouldn't promote to know within even, they didn't get attack opportunity on. Oh, that's right. Yeah, and then I will hit it with a another Sonic class and you never know with these things.

02:42:29

Have I have combat reflexes was true.

02:42:39

And then okay actually I'm going to consume one of my first on themselves to regain my routine. I could surprised if it had the dexterity to even meet their requirements, very true. But I'm playing a character that doesn't know how constructs work.

02:43:05

How you can assuming the only thought I have left with it for a bubble and that's the animated my turn.

02:43:29

That dude is dead. No way five foot step.

02:43:43

Crunch.

02:43:55

That doesn't have in my that goddammit. Well, I didn't roll it. Oh, a sec. A holy shit. No, I plus an additional 10. All right. So not won't help 25 point damage. Second attack with it. Does unfortunately, yeah.

02:44:27

Anything else in return? Not she's good because me immediately it wasn't you know just that when that chick lands there is like suddenly just a spurt of blood out of her neck. Just Wow.

02:44:52

You are now biggest threat.

02:44:59

It misses.

02:45:36

He?

02:45:55

That was supposed to be Prodigy. Sorry, taken away. He's really good. I was about to the cup. Don't add that.

02:46:09

Thank you.

02:46:19

When you put,

02:46:43

You guys hear more of that wrenching, blizzard noises.

02:46:53

And what maybe sounds like a wall being assaulted.

02:47:01

Can't see anything now though.

02:47:06

All right, you remember me? I'm just gonna you this. Really, we'll take a five foot step and then we'll do a period blows a shooting with one arrows against the statute.

02:47:31

That man.

02:47:36

A whole That first sterile drops him all right? And there's no other targets, he can see. So I guess there's other is just on that and that's it. You keep them.

02:47:59

Ochi Ochi is going to destroy his link sidecharm as a standard action. You just crushes a little thingy in his hand.

02:48:14

There's no use button so I'm just deleting it. But I do the seeing now.

02:48:24

And then he will move up in front of Greyson-ish and see if you can see anything Now that he's feeling slightly better. In fact, he'll go to that one, actually. So we can see, and he sees nothing.

02:48:53

Unless he sees maybe some residual ice going on, like it right here. Swallow over here. Yeah, it's frosty in here.

02:49:04

Something's going on in the back corner.

02:49:16

Anything else on your turn? No, that's going to be it Shilko.

02:49:35

Well, If there's nobody If you can't see anybody, then they have to be in the smoke. So Shoko will try and expose them.

02:49:57

I will throw I I assumed it would give me like a little like template. I I don't understand boundary, uh, I'm trying to hit this corner. Okay, so if something you have doesn't have a template setup, you can go to the measurement controls over here on the side. So like circle and start pulling.

02:50:23

That'll just look. Okay, I'm going to move the dot over one more so it doesn't hit Grayson.

02:50:36

Don't we have five foot base? Oh yeah. It's only five spot right here. So it should be, it should be where I put it and the great him will be fine.

02:50:57

Where is the measurable?

02:51:02

Measurement, control release.

02:51:11

There like that. Yep. We're gonna skip the whole re-rolling for concealment because there's a smoke club there. Blocking all over vision. Hi, there's no one in the smoke cloud.

02:51:33

Huh. All right. Oh, that's a waste of my turn. Then snowcoe will.

02:51:44

Let's say here, yeah.

02:51:52

Question is. How much longer this smoke cloud got left on it. One more round. Yeah, it'll go away on my turn.

02:52:03

Video.

02:52:13

I'm going to relay till after Christmas term.

02:52:20

I think I could do something. I don't know.

02:52:27

I will actually move into the cloud.

02:52:38

Back there.

02:53:12

Yeah, maybe the heels out there. No, that's it.

02:53:18

No way. So now is she invisibility is going to vanish, so she can't do anything about that. But she's gonna do needing more people to stab frankly.

02:53:48

Or.

02:53:54

Now goes to there, reaction reallocates for enhancement bonus community. See, from her defending weapon. And I'm just gonna total difference. Keep an eye out and wonder what the fuck is going on with the frost?

02:54:14

But I'm sorry. Did someone links charm again? No way. Still has it. And I also have it active. No way. I think nobody here in the very first round. It's round four. Yep. And it's like gone. Like I said at the beginning of this round. Oh okay. And although I have one more I don't have to wear without thinking about, I don't have the the wear with all to use it right now.

02:54:46

So, because my hands are full. So I'm taking a defensive stance. So my AC is a little bit higher not by much but it is higher.

02:55:07

I get the fact that the distinct impression this skull is going to be relevant in.

02:55:19

I figured as much. Oh, she is immediate as an immediate action. It's gonna begin crying. Okay, Me and Grayson are lucky. We don't see what's happening.

02:55:35

She spits the word traitor. In Tian. South single swing in Tian. What? I'm just Tian.

02:55:53

It's just Tian. They didn't give her a sub language. No, for sure there was vacuum going in the background so I thought I heard another word at the end of it. I was like, do I understand? Oh yes. And I did traitor. Yeah. No, I heard the word. It's, I heard she says the word trader in Tian and then vacuum noises.

02:56:10

So Yes, so that's just wings oath breaker and I would like to pee on from there's like seven kind of that will come up once you get there actually, But yes, because I am smart that misses

02:56:37

I want to take this moment to the packet on the purposes for giving me a defunding weapon. Okay, like, and now I owe a makeup one for being born in Mako.

02:56:52

What is a technical hear the clouds that would there was there was a 20% faith that would miss bluetooth it.

02:57:12

Oh my. So she has like a greater invisibility or she teleported to me. Why didn't I see her? Until she was right in front of me.

02:57:25

He was right here. 30 feet up. She was up. I got you.

02:57:38

Frozen shadow ninja.

02:57:44

Just have a killer come into seven height.

02:57:52

I shouldn't be rejoicing the and probably not.

02:58:02

You.

02:58:32

This door slash wall Shatters and his rent asunder.

02:58:42

You've got to be fucking with me.

02:58:48

The wolf, these came in datsu. Let's lose a howl of Fury and already took a standard action but takes a move action to move closer to where, and as he walks onto the koi bun. Slash rapidly moves on the quick one, it freezes underneath his paws. Did he just kill the koi?

02:59:08

He did. Does he have any idea how expensive those are? They'll be fair if they are koi once the water thaws, they'll probably be fine. All right, I'm gonna let it slide this time.

02:59:23

Racing. I'm intrigued by this animal rights activist side of Abochi. I am literally a bird.

02:59:34

I really want koi someday in the future. Sorry, I was a cloud. Go away beginning or end of my turn. Now it goes away right now. All right, more importantly though, get rid of wall.

02:59:52

Now information to complete me annihilate, this thing so that I don't even get to use this band property. So, I don't see a ninja that had just attacked. Koya is a correct and not from where you are. Oh I see I'll use a shirt though. Okay, he also stay out of all right.

03:00:14

So he yeah, he'll do a query blue. Supposed to ski shot against you.

03:00:23

I'm gonna be really mad if you kill Kim and Dotsu. Before I get an attack off, I would assume she's got a lot of help, he does have a lot of help.

03:00:36

And that is a lot of Dodge.

03:00:41

But she has on July or I forget what day are that? You have that the way where you standing are you right here. You sick to your knowledge. Most sugar me just don't have anything.

03:01:05

Just regeneration.

03:01:16

This one is gonna shoot the spellcaster.

03:01:27

Six video, he misses Then we can come and culture type popping in popping a and image. Well, that is against your flat foot at AC So I'll ask again, why couldn't I see that one? That disappeared, the smoke cloud and it was invisible, too. Invisibility isn't a problem. Okay, book, you can currently see invisible targets.

03:02:04

Yeah, we pop into my come down. I would have I would have worn him as soon as the smoke cloud went away if I could see him. I don't if we're it was dispersing. It's fine. He took You're also a little distracting I would say. Yeah. And I normally all for that rule I was just like am I not understanding something about the rules of visibility?

03:02:23

You know, I wouldn't have spent the action But that's fine. It's my turn. I really want to hit her a bunch, but I want to get sweet sweet, precision damage, what to do. I mean, you would know any of the flank those bitch as quick as possible. Yeah. I just mean he is technically 10 feet up too.

03:02:46

So be true. She floating, it's like, oh, Can I hit her if she's 10 feet up? I you could jump and make a swing from doing that. Anyways, I'd like to move around behind her. Can I go through or around? Does it make a large difference? It's the plus 5 for CMD.

03:03:09

If I go through, right, You won't be going through her space. You're going be going past it because she's three-dimensionally up off the ground. Gotcha. Okay. Well then I'll make my check to move over here. What? I still be flanking diagonal because she's a large creature.

03:03:27

Right. No, not unless someone else was up there. So right here I'd be flanking, though. No advant, she's got. You got to be flying. Oh my lord. Yeah. If one of you got up onto the 20 foot ledge, you could get blinking with her. I see what you're saying, three-dimensionally.

03:03:47

We need to be out basically opposite sides. Okay, it's 20 feet up. Can I climb that effectively in a way? That's only gonna cost me and move action.

03:04:02

I don't have no ways. Cool ninja skills yet. So, No, but that might be a hint toast to what you might want to do and then ready in action for when no idea. Does the cool ninja thing that's fair? She does appear to be eyeing that wall. I'm going.

03:04:19

I can thank you from there. Boom. So her CMD is not actually that she still has the old conversion pump on her expenses. For some reason I have removed it so just so I don't 22 just so I don't mess it up. What square would you want to end up in?

03:04:37

So I know how to make sure that we actually flank if you're gonna up here or so, I'd want to be there. There's either one. Yep. You either one would be fine. Okay. I'm going to run around that away.

03:05:02

Something along those lines. Yes, it doesn't super matter. We make a check to see if we think this wolf is good or not. Like do we can and we think look, yeah, for knowledge, check. Okay. I don't know. I don't know how to cancel magical. I don't know how to cancel my movement because I'd like to ask and I have that skill, so we'll put me back, I guess.

03:05:33

Just pretend, I was whatever. Are you friend or foe? He will say to this cool ass wolf, you help me slate her. I will be your friend for the next day And you said Arcona Arcana. Yes, They don't have a lot. There we go. Winter wolves are not generally fond of People in general, but they're essentially not fun of being captured and he's got manacles attached to his leg.

03:06:07

Oh, hell yeah. Okay, so he's gonna help us kill her. That's good for me. I would like to acrobatics and not get. Punched, I would like you to roll that getting hit by oath. Breaker is not a good idea, You success by one. I was gonna panic. I was like, this is a really high check, and then, since I'm doing the thing, I'm gonna go ahead and faint also.

03:06:41

Oh, that's pretty good. Pretty good, you success. Okay, so now I get to do one punch.

03:06:52

And then see, which is still very high.

03:06:59

Bitch is not a dex build. Oh my god. Damage is beautiful. But it is not enough to hit her. I quit I don't want to play Pathfinder anymore. He's a book about This fight has been quite arduous. Okay, That's what she started. That's okay. I'm gonna do a lot of damage next round after no, A and Grayson.

03:07:32

In this wolf, I've already killed her.

03:07:38

Just goes gonna try and make sure she doesn't hit. You guys in public breaker just goes going to birds. Drop is so I forgot my shields. Got this one. Positive somatic? Yes, it does. So to drop my shoes and gestures up her.

03:08:00

That shouldn't be. That's something right, DC? But okay.

03:08:11

Don't really. Oh wait. No, I have to do the select tool and it's not letting me select her. There's an element in the selector you're selecting, select targets, I was trying to, So let's tokens. I click her and then the roads are just going to take my crystal select target, the one beneath it.

03:08:38

So, let's turn. Okay.

03:08:52

And she has minus two on this save.

03:09:00

Would 18 have hit flat-footed? No. Okay. Just checking because I need to fix Bane.

03:09:30

Oh, Jesus Christ.

03:09:36

All right. I like she also has spell resistance.

03:09:45

It doesn't matter.

03:09:51

But good to know anything else, sir.

03:09:59

I guess I'll use my movement to pick my shield back up.

03:10:06

Video.

03:10:10

So, how about you from? This is probably I get me killed but I'll do it. Gonna spin it arcade point, really caliper over here.

03:10:32

Then.

03:10:38

What are any of these in those two ninjas hurt. Anyway, they are not Well. Now, they're gonna get hurt while the line targeted anyway.

03:10:58

It busted by myself. Yes, he do for almost half his health. Then I'm going to try to foot action.

03:11:10

To consume felt. And then patients doesn't imagine little tight I think. Yeah, I don't know. It's possibution. It's yeah, it's part of the move action, too. International flight very well. Please continue Hillary helping you know about Arcana's all the time. Yeah. It's the Wizard one that takes us with them acts, like I mentioned

03:11:42

And that is the end of my turn. Hey, well, no way. Cool drops her defending like and I'm gonna Thank you wonderfulness. That is your your speed boost. It is it is wonderful. Let's find out if I get whacked.

03:12:03

You definitely do not. All right, you know, like temporary like show this walkazashi handle into her mouth and she climbs with the side of this thing. And then just leaps and tries to whack Kevin. That's where she makes the top of it. So I have to ask a question.

03:12:22

Do I have something? You do and briefly high ground? Oh no. Right? So I have flunking and I also have high ground which makes this a three. I'm not too up and floating, I am doing that. It is already doing. It is kamikaze.

03:12:46

I'm so bad. I am so beyond that. Yep. Reduce your your AC by 3 for clearing for cleansing stripe. Just in there are probably I did roll a three on the confirmation roll, which is unfortunate and that's still hurt like the fucking dickens though. Yeah. So you see this like our king slash just come straight down and there's like a long line of blood, just stir it out underneath, given Dobson, You can trace noise, path through this whole fight by just the trail of blood leaking out of her the whole way, you really get.

03:13:38

Yep. Yep, you certainly can and I need to take the coil damage. You are a chunk out of her on your way down.

03:14:07

Yep.

03:14:20

Include. All right, the ball. She is going to five foot float up. Boom and speak at you in Tian, no way.

03:14:46

Yeah, that's about right. Yep. That's that's exactly what I expected, yeah. Hell yeah, we don't understand sister. They have brainwashed. You the sounds of the Amitatsu must die. Only the only can roam in Kai, you know, this to be true.

03:15:12

I would like and a post charisma check for me from you. Yes. Okay.

03:15:25

Yep.

03:15:31

So you must stop them faith. Threaten everything. We good for.

03:15:46

Is Trump monster. It's not language. Depending at all. Hopefully speaks all the same languages that way. I know, I know, but I am just so much flexible song. Yeah, you see. You know, you're kind of like looking very angry and kind of clutches her head promote and then just continues to look angry but doesn't appear to be looking at human dot.

03:16:16

Two more through it just for anyone that's unaware of what term? The not dominate person. It's it's not a domination effect but this is no way but no way. It's so perfectly set up the effected by it. Like it is. I know I love this. Good job. Oh, but not actually, that's very true.

03:16:47

You play footstep. And Yeah, you guys made your spell crafts for that, right? Oh both, I can't help.

03:17:03

Yeah, I don't know.

03:17:08

Well, I guess I'll make the check anyway because I guess I can fail putting night 19 or 20 I had. Can you do anything? No, you have luck and travel. How I wish you had the liberation domain right now. But even there's my phone contact, by the way. I yeah.

03:17:34

Even as a spell like ability, it seems very obvious that she has used some no way whether or not Noah has done enough physically to tell you. If she pastor failed that check though, would require a sense of motive or she has not acted yet. Set smooth. It gay.

03:17:59

Do you say on us out loud? You that was a charm. Term monster up fell. Well personally, like ability.

03:18:15

About. Oh, oh yeah.

03:18:41

Probably. Yeah, at 16 hits Koya. Exactly. Oh my god.

03:18:54

Course still up. Oh yeah, is still up.

03:19:02

He's going to cast defensively. Whoo, super defensively.

03:19:11

And she says, sorry Ochi up that's on her. I, I understand.

03:19:23

For open shadow ninja.

03:19:33

Deal. You got anything invisibility? No, I do not sadly. Because I did not personally I had I'm out of second normal's fellow. So, Well, I'm pretty sure about hits but it doesn't crit. Then God, That doesn't trip. But roll the mission, How many images have you lost? Now, I have four images like for 1v5.

03:20:07

Upson image.

03:20:19

The winter wolf Steps forward tilt his head up slightly.

03:20:29

So that none of you are actually cut in this.

03:20:39

Nice ice. In fact, ice, I used to meet you. I just So. Where did we land with Zio spellcraft check? Knowing no way is gonna kill us all. Now, we know that she's the charmed person was char monsters cast on her. We don't know. She succeeded or not. We can write sense mode of checks to see if she succeeded.

03:21:10

Grayson, I guess we should all just do that now, You just close the door and you're like good like guys. Well if if zeo shouted it out I think we would all be trying to like watch her, right? Yeah.

03:21:27

5 foot steps in. And look at these ninjas. Look at them. And just OG looks deep into your soul to see if you're gonna kill him.

03:21:43

I mean, I'm gonna try there anyway. First one first arrow hits. Doesn't drop him second, narrow hits and drops him. Third arrow with third one. Are the second one. Yep. And drops him because he took magic missiles and then, you know, I guess the fourth would go to her.

03:22:08

Yeah.

03:22:12

Doesn't get through her DR. That's it. No, not that much.

03:22:30

All the pros and shadows. I did OG He survived and okay. No exacting weird which is not should not seeing all this go down and just being full of rage at Kevin Dotsu seeing to invade them at every turn Ochi is gonna start spurting blood out of his own body as well.

03:23:01

It wouldn't know. Yes. You're you're he doesn't know that he's doing that. He just knows that he wants to kill Kim and Dotsu and he has, I don't think you can hit her. Now again I not hit her. She's 15 feet up, right? Oh, that is a little far out to range unless you roll really high to.

03:23:24

Like, I'll let you do the acrobatics ruling to get up there. I'm gonna call it a 30 vote. So, but like that's movement. Am I getting one attack? Or can I full attack? I've imagining, if I jump one attack. Yeah, that's horrible. Okay. Hello, how does she look? Um, She looks decently fucked up actually perfect.

03:23:48

Okay. Let me just make sure I have enough points for this.

03:23:57

Yeah, I have exactly enough points. She only gets the heel fiber around. No. I mean my key points I'll have to manually reduce them but I'm out if I do this So acrobatics to jump, right? Yes, sir. Okay. And then we're gonna do a swing. Whoops. Okay. I do not have flanking anymore or do I?

03:24:29

No, No, he's on the ground now. Okay.

03:24:38

You'd like dived up and playing squirrel that better.

03:24:44

Oh my. Oh my

03:24:51

And is 21.

03:24:58

Oh my fuck, she looks fucked. Oh, now it. Oh, I did additional three. No, that was me taking my bleeding. How much damage he takes recoil?

03:25:14

You die here, Kevin Dotsu. And then, I'm pretty sure that's my whole turn. Alrighty, that brings us to Shoko.

03:25:28

Yeah, sorry about this of no way. But you are maybe charmed right now. What? And if you would talk about wolf and put him against us, then we're all dead. So,

03:25:48

Shoko looks at no way and makes her make a safe. Let's just bell, please.

03:25:58

Point. No, no, not on the fucking god. Damn it. I I get it if you're casting that on on no way like oh well, it's fine. Well, she's got to do is click the button. So 21. Wait. Yeah. Balance is out to a 19 with his minus two on fear effects, which still meets it.

03:26:25

Welcome back against the charm. No, ages really doesn't like listening to you.

03:26:34

You notice to be true. Kevin Dotsu says kill all your friends, they're dumb. Yeah, I know. Ian says she's right. We're actually here to kill, you know. Right, me particular memes. Me me. I minute we are.

03:26:56

I mean I make it exception roll.

03:27:04

I mean I don't have any control over. No, A at this point she belongs, you know, she made the same, she is taken.

03:27:15

This is all it's it's over. Suck. This is all really sick. I'm just gonna really miss OG after this fights over. I'm not gonna lie. I have. Oh, oh, the target is shaking no matter what. Then Kim and Dotsu would have been shaken when she made that swing against Hoya, which means she would have had two less from the hit, which means she wouldn't have hit.

03:27:39

I think we're too far gone past that obviously, I would have also had to have gotten just are with. They didn't have you rolled like that's all left. From we're getting pretty deep in the sauce here. Okay. I think I would be really easy to go back and change, but if you say, so would be going back to the last round and changing like four different roles?

03:28:07

Yeah, we'd have to like redo like oh yeah already heal yourself like

03:28:14

Program. I get it. I've done the same thing. One HP lab. So So this is going to, This will be fine. This should be fine. I could take care of Kevin, Dotsu.

03:28:35

Bye, she drops.

03:28:41

View the floor with a very loud button, okay? And now coming into effect would be. I think everybody else rolled really poor on the sense motive except I don't know what show go rolled and we never opposed it. So do we actually can we figure out where we stand with?

03:28:58

No way? Right now, it's still in highly decide when went no way. Hate that. Like, she is charmed and because her history and her questioning recently, I chose Abby to make appropriate decisions and until Kim. And that was dead. That term person is still going.

03:29:20

And that was the end of my turn. Yep. No way. So I have a very important question. She when does your links run out That glad you asked? And this is why I asked about the sense motive. I think it might have ran out at this last round but I'll have to go back and look, I don't I'm pretty sure I don't have it currently, I put one round in and we'll check my attack since then.

03:29:44

When I I put in, when I use the first round of it, they get the important now. It is very important now because I know exactly what she's going to do because I I was like okay I know what's in character I know what would be appropriate for frozen missions.

03:30:01

So no ways to do. So I am, I am going to do this regardless of whatever you answer is. Yeah, I'm it's really hard to tell, let me see the chat here. Yeah, I think we're on like four or five rounds past when my first used the links I charm.

03:30:22

If I'm honest. Okay, with yours in round two the round Avenue here. I think what's wrong? Like three or fours. I put it in chat for this reason, so that's I'm scrolling back right now.

03:30:41

Yeah, it's so far back. I think I've gone like three or four times actually since I first used it, which you should totally keep checking. We'll just keep running out this turn timer and then no we won't do anything. Right. I'm a hundred percent. Certain my links I charm has gone now.

03:30:59

All right, let us move forward. Then So she like holds her ahead for a bit and then banishes. So, And at least for the no one else has seen visibility right? Nope. Then none of you know what she does next because she definitely does stuff and just to be fair I am I am going to tell friends what what nobody does actually

03:31:38

Or you have one round left. Really. Did I scroll past it? Yeah, you scroll past it. I'm sorry. I've been looking this whole time. Could you be two attacks? Did you see what round? It's in. Yeah, we've been in round three when you started, Okay, because I would have counted for one of the rounds because I put it in at the end of the realm, not what I used it.

03:32:03

Well, I guess that's the same thing effectively, but

03:32:10

Chris Brown link side Charm.

03:32:18

Because rotten that, that round.

03:32:27

Shoko. Did his term care move? Stop.

03:32:40

I don't have the ability to see things when I'm looking for them so I'm not gonna find it. The ultimate fire.

03:32:54

It has been three rounds since he used it, So, it's gone, right? I'm pretty sure it's three rounds. Let me look.

03:33:05

Hey, don't actually know to talk my head. I didn't know that item existed until no. I showed it to me. Yeah, it's three rounds than directed. Yes. And,

03:33:21

Well, quickly read this.

03:33:31

All right, no way. Let me.

03:33:42

Make your attack rolls.

03:33:47

Attack role. Yeah, I was about to say I'm, I'm not quite that mean.

03:34:03

I am Batman. Oh,

03:34:09

Um you don't you don't confirm, you do not confirm she's not oh wait I'm sorry you actually probably do. I'm done. Oh, I see. I'm sorry. I just assumed get one in the dress so that you can't recover. All right, for one look. Forward to Spivey being our pocket Healer.

03:34:48

So yeah, that that thing of, you know, omniani you're getting a flashback over on that construct. You see it again. It is much worse this time and it looks like the entirety of court is back. Just gets flint stealth. And some of you who understand John, which I think is all of you.

03:35:08

You hear a very, very godly. It's a storm previously. It's not actually printed, I couldn't hear what she said. Yeah, it was really like, muffled. I'm sorry to the storm. Glory to the storm. Oh, Oh. Oh my god. It's the Nikoia. I was at the rest for your turn but luckily, yes, I came in to stabilizes.

03:35:50

Yeah. No, I have a very, very important question. Model front. Be a good dog. She's, I have an important question about human datsu. Hmm. She was 15 feet in the air when she went unconscious. Does she take any fall? Damage she would, in fact take a d6 of it because she can't catch herself.

03:36:17

That is not enough, sadly to guarantee her death. Okay. Because I could have saved Koya's life with that one. He has a 23 constitution. Yeah, I bet she fucking does. Oh, okie dokie. So queer. Takes her three bleak damage and the beginning of her round. You take seven, actually.

03:36:43

You did. Just take seven, please do not take seven that

03:36:50

Go up to one, right? Yeah, it's been funky. It is weird. We got negative seven. There we go. So she was at nearly full health when she got hit, right? She had 31 HP when she got hit. Okay, and now she makes Constitution. Check with -7 does not stabilize.

03:37:21

Between which actually means takes one more. Leave little boom. Didn't come and talk to be leaving. I mean that's yours regeneration.

03:37:43

He is gonna thank the bull, round action and could agro.

03:37:54

Then, and

03:38:02

Boom. Boom. Just as he moleser down to the negative 32 and the term person and

03:38:17

As she is viciously viciously savaged by the large white warg, huh?

03:38:29

I don't don't go Someone is gonna put a potion in Sequoia immediately right on body tackles no way to get her aside. Yeah I'm gonna start doing a heel check on Koya to try and stabilize her. I've been doing it. I'm going to I'm going to move action. Tell Lily, tell them like okay fuck, I can't do that.

03:38:50

I do a heel. Check you stabilizer With a plus two. Also remember that reminds me I need to take her two week old damage. But yeah, no does not resist in the slightest. Does anybody have any potions and then? Oh, yes. We have quite a few. Okay, I take one of those out of my butt because I should be carrying some, and I pour it in a koias mouth.

03:39:21

We have lesser cure, cure light. We've got a cure one, cure mod. If you want it, throw a cure mod inner.

03:39:31

Are you? I used one of my cure light, you know. Yeah. I saw Zio's like I'm hoping everyone pork. Oh yes. Throw. Okay, no one.

03:39:51

And no, it's just like kind of looking at our hands a bit different. Ah,

03:40:03

I One more I can't find a cure moderate in like three different places that I've looked at the Commandia, go into spells, drag it onto your inventory tab, it will ask you if you want to create a potion, a scroll, or one.

03:40:29

Not actually here to kill you. By the way, that was to make you try to start. Of the you see a very disorientated? No, I kind of stagger past. You pick up, pick up her her abandoned Wakazashi And how how, like absolutely mold. There's a mod for Koya. There is an explosion of blood and Winter will begins consuming her That's fine.

03:41:13

Oh, gee is gonna walk up to no way and grab her by the shirt collar and shove her up against the wall. What in the flying? Fuck is wrong with you?

03:41:28

Oh, hang on ochi shoulder. It's enchantment. Magic. Like what I do. She wasn't in control of herself. That's actually I can't do that because of Kim and Nazi's body. It won't let me move up to. Nobody can't do that but we get the visual and no. Again, it's not resisting and the the coating of blood at least across your face in the symbols that have been crawling up for her necklac, was back that we can't be around societal that, by the way, seven 7, We can't actually see anybody's facial expressions or like, anything like that, because no way is covered in her own blood Kim, and Dotsu's blood, probably a little bit of coya's blood and I am similarly covered like head to toe in blood, so I just want to paint that visually.

03:42:25

It's more crimson than black at this pleasant moment. It also got cooked earlier but so he takes into account like a sort of against his will. What shoko is saying? And he says, is that true? All she did was speak to you and you immediately almost killed Koya. Was that of your own doing?

03:42:52

No. Yes. No, I think We trusted you. You said it was in your interest. You said you wanted to kill them? Hi, still do their lives and it seems like you want some of them walking out here with their lives and taps, but I letting some of them live as not the same as killing each other.

03:43:23

Isn't this smarter people in our grappled with these? Oh, you and show. Go will put himself in between the two. You know, Actually Ochi goes and like, stomps off for a second to like, chill out. He's very puffy right now. All of his feathers are standing up. We don't have time to fight and argue each other.

03:43:50

We need to find on the code.

03:43:56

He points at you and he says, we'll have more questions for you later but you walk in front of me wherever we're going.

03:44:06

I will then step up to. Well, I'll look to the wolf. Is he still eating? Yes, Are you okay? Corya.

03:44:20

Coil looks including Kim, and datsu's it because he kind of just ribs her armor off of her. He doesn't seem to have any interest in it through. At least made me our head. He peels are like a pistachio B does and he kind of growls at you a little bit and jumped down harder over her, but doesn't say no.

03:44:49

And I have that one to play marrow. Yeah, koi. Are you alright and find childhood?

03:45:04

You certainly getting that adventure? I've always wanted. Yeah, I I'm really happy that you're getting to experience this sense of wonder that you've always been seeking, but I think maybe we're gonna have you take a day or two off. You have almost died like every single day for three days in a row.

03:45:24

My boy, I have felt more alive in the last few days than I have in many years and she pokes you in the beak with her wand.

03:45:39

I'll respect your wishes. If everybody in this world was 10% as strong as you. We wouldn't have any troubles that break and Ashoka will approach the wolf and say and we have you to thank for. Saving us. You have a name there. Big guy type A, Can you spell it?

03:46:12

Okay, why G? And I guide me, he kind of licks some Kim and Dutsu out of this space. So, what's your story? She had your truck back there and showco will appear over her shoulder at the broken. Wall phone right here. We tried to taint me.

03:46:45

We can clearly see that. That was a mistake. These only of the five storms think that can troll the storms of the north, their fools,

03:47:01

It seems. So what we have our sincerest things we I think we may have lost some people had you not escaped and showed up when you did is you who must be thanked. I heard your battle with Kim and Dotsu. And knew it was my chance to be.

03:47:23

We searched this keep up and down and We'd never saw you. Where did they have you health captive over here? Kind of not sorts the wall? He broke through. That's just like a bunch of metal shards of ice. Now, I don't suppose they were keeping a few humans back there with you.

03:47:47

I smelled the man with a female. Do you know, where they're being kept? She said something. I assumed she was lying about having them up on a cliff or some such, We're looking for our friend to Mako.

03:48:06

She's very important to us. Choco will just call into the darkness Ahne. You back there. You don't hear anything coming from that direction, but The passage beyond the secret door, that's no longer there or grid carries a noticeable. Chill around the corner, stands two pairs of heavy. Wooden doors.

03:48:26

Both secured by large locks. One of those doors, is a bunch of ice shards of wood. Now.

03:48:35

I'm going to go back here. That would be this door. That's been destroyed the way. No way you think you could pull yourself together enough to put up on the sub for us? Do I need to take your weapons? We are not going to hurt you but can we trust you to act correctly?

03:48:54

Tile Be more compassionate. No, it is simply ignoring you because right now, she has the head of Finland about to in her hands and she walks over to the fountain and looks a bit for a bit sees that it's frozen over and smashes through the ice with a foot.

03:49:16

And then don't the head in the water rinses. It back and forth a bit. Pulls it out reaches into our bag. Pulls out some sort of cloth and then just wraps the head in it and puts it back into her bag without saying a single word. Oh yeah, yields.

03:49:34

You, We'll take that as an act of neutrality for now. Whatever over here. Don't let it happen again. Oh yeah. The general very high on your spelled crap. Jack know, what happened reaches out to touch noise shoulder. When you are questioning your identity and being misleading, you have nothing to feel bad for.

03:50:03

And no, I just flinch, but the protection. Then once she's done recruiting business, with with the with the head and putting it, and in a bag, she goes up to collect her to dropped. Um, the funding sword, the brushes that offer against the leg, and she used it. And then take some for glasses and look like looks a bit on the before she does this.

03:50:37

And then outright, They're on genuflex to Korean is like on my honor as a descendants of the Naruto plan, I am sorry. Those blows are not Thor. Honorable sorts truly. I am. Sorry.

03:51:07

May accept your apology no way. Thank you. I cannot promise that it will not happen again. You realize I fear, I have much to learn of my own mind. I can promise it'll never happen again.

03:51:27

We think 100 yourself alive bird.

03:51:34

Probably not further than the scent. Now, her mind was manipulated. He was taken advantage of.

03:51:47

But if it plays you and that no, I will actually hold out one of her luck of Ashes, specifically her on eBay. One, Thank you. It makes you feel better. This gesture means a great deal as well as your words. Exchange with Cohen. You can understand how I could be alarmed.

03:52:12

But I appreciate the Goodwill. Yeah. When you say like, how it could be alarmed. No, I just snowed to you and says, you Imagine what? I feel like this dark cult cell is cold enough to cause breath to fog. And he'll have about two owns animal waste and toughs of white bird.

03:52:32

Littered the floor, Just the fact that you had it into a, he ends it back to you. No, and keep hold of it for now at least. And she looks like a hand to you guys. Like like a like a stop there and then he takes the the door handle and jostles it and tries to open it and bangs on the door a bit.

03:52:55

Is he held up a hand to stop and then Zio walks up. Anyways. Okay, no traps go off. No. Traps go up. You don't hear anyone replying?

03:53:12

All right, it doesn't seem trucked but maybe when we open it as well.

03:53:25

Plus that Coco will stand back a little bit.

03:53:32

Not too. Did have a key on her. Oh honestly, Nobody would be Grayson. Who got her key. Yeah grace. And I know it goes, stripping body.

03:53:49

He tosses it down the hallway TV, all right.

03:54:01

Hey, guess what? The key. It also well unlocking, the door turns off her plane check traps

03:54:12

It's wonderful. Let me not wolf a flame strike as it burst out to help us. No, no. It does not. Okay.

03:54:31

Lady Mako. Welcome. This room antique darkness fills the chamber. Fills the inside of this chamber along with a stale fishy smell mixed with the stench of unwatched bodies. The sound of dripping water and a low moan echo through the still air. And you find two people beaten and unconscious one.

03:55:02

You know, well Islamico. Now, there is this gentleman, though. He is currently this robed. Of this gear.

03:55:37

I'm Koya.

03:55:44

Or they, all right.

03:55:49

Does Koya have spells left because I'll use some of our cure light inventory. That I think we still have left to get them up. Oh, she's still got her one. Oh, that's right. I'll delete them off my sheet. Then for now, and I may go awaykins

03:56:09

He is still bound to hand and foot and kind of laying there. That's the one. Who's untied them. Yeah, we're gonna cut them loose, let's get you out of here, kiddo.

03:56:28

Puck my life.

03:56:33

Getting really sick of being kidnapped. Get used to a princess. Maybe if you weren't sleeping on the job,

03:56:45

We're sorry. Comic. That is a joke I'm sorry. It's Really. Did you have any way to expect that a bunch of ninjas were going to appear out of the darkness on a boat? And pull me off the side on a funeral boat. That was lit. On fire, the the danger that we face every moment that you're alive and they are also alive.

03:57:09

Yes. Sorry, I shouldn't speak to you. Such waste. The story Shoko, should have been more prepared.

03:57:21

We just

03:57:29

No. No, I don't think so. Hmm. And you must be like a check just to make sure no injections, no sights. No untoward or, you know, those those eye checks, right? She doesn't seem to be poisoned just like she was beaten to with an inch for life with what looked like.

03:57:52

Probably outbreaker. Mmm. Yeah, that thing will do it. If they do anything to you, any they have a wizard here. I don't know what, like like can they look into minds or something? I'd look at Zeo stuff that doesn't know much. That's what that powerful spellcraft casters. Certainly can.

03:58:16

Yeah, very well or not whether or not most workout. One up is unlikely. If they were you get to be would be dead? Yeah, if they were we would be dead.

03:58:34

And you must be off. I am both your mentor. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Your you've got to find student there. Old, she really struggled to find people to find you. She's waiting upstairs, got up in a bit hard early on in our delve down here, but She'll be happy to see you.

03:59:01

We had hope to meet you in a nice warm in somewhere rather than here. Normally that is where I prefer to take my rest during the winter months. I did not know why. Big kidnapped me until this woman was brought in. So you understand some of the situation then have you two spoken?

03:59:26

No, like human datsu, Right? Much. She was very dumb. She did try and take a nine-on-one.

03:59:43

In my opinion, that's not to wrestled with bears.

03:59:52

I am a little was why did she because he's others going north. I would have thought. Yeah, he's like the only skeleton cows guard. That would here.

04:00:13

She was trying to hold all the chess pieces so to speak. You know why? She didn't just kill you two, you know, Have you not? She never spoke to this.

04:00:33

Well, I think it's best if we get to U2 out of here. Yeah and quick my running theories that she kept you alive because she meant to turn you over to someone. And if that's someone is on their way know you want to be as far away from here as possible.

04:00:50

I would theorize that she kept them alive to draw you here Scions of the Amitabhi.

04:01:02

She did choose her ground very well. This was not easy. Also, some of you are marked as Scion where the last cyan of their house hill. Their bloodline ended. We better within us the power to mark you, as the next ruler of income All who have been marked as a scion.

04:01:29

We kind of inherent. I know that information, right? You knew the marked as a scion parts? Wait, I'm marked to inherit Minkai. Coco drops a fireballs for a long null because everyone. No, Only. If I'm Miko dies, he is still though. Only blood relative left of the Amitats you find, but it was in is within my power to name.

04:01:58

Another air is amigo saying this No Ed, no Sueus. Okay, I thought it was olf talking the whole time. I was like, how this olf know all of this that's sword. Yeah. Where is Rob going, on view didn't hear a thing. Yeah, I'm carrying Tano suey. It's in my belt.

04:02:21

And speaking of which, as he starts to talk about all this, I actually pull potato sui out. And I know a Maaco can hear him, but I was like, well, I say yeah, she's kind of staring wide-eyed at the store. Yeah, I think there's someone just reads. It's real.

04:02:39

This means it's real. I think there's someone that you should meet a mako. I'd like to present this to you and he pulls out the sword and said that Grayson looks at the four of us that are marked and under his breath, he's just like, oh, if it makeup dies mean guys screwed.

04:02:59

But Ochi genuflex. Oh, gee genuflex and hands the sword up to her with both hands.

04:03:11

She very gingerly takes the sword and drugs, 10, those suing and the blade glows bright gold and births into golden flames, as she pulled in.

04:03:33

Buy Shizuru.

04:03:39

Now, that is a site that I love to see.

04:03:48

Let's get you out of here. Your guys Olaf in the mako. Your gear is upstairs. Yeah, yeah. Time to leave sounds about, right. Let's she's dead. No silly with us and then moves to start like he's gonna leave and realize she gives me where I view best. Follow us.

04:04:11

Come on.

04:04:16

And we can just, can we percept on the way out? Make sure we didn't miss anything like just you absolutely miss nothing. You actually got every nooking place. Like and then the blood guy is leaves Jorgen. Who was like two floors up from you What?

04:04:41

Well yeah, we should probably go check on that. Jordan, pillow. Oh, we need to address my best friend. Just offering a job. I turned to. But what the wolf and I'm like, So what are you gonna do now? Hold on, Grayson's. Got the idea. We need to address. Oh, geez, mistakes.

04:04:57

As a person real quick, I will travel into the north. It is my homeland and my sovereign domain. I guess that makes sense. We're probably going to be fighting those. Well, you call them the only of the four storms. Again, five is one up. Eat more only flush. I'm talking pauses.

04:05:35

You talking to the wolf or the bear, the wolf.

04:05:43

Positive because I need to look at the development section.

04:05:54

If I could convince this cool wolf to join our caravan, I will be so happy.

04:06:02

Do you want to have people eating wolf on the caravan? And then probably and the party helps him in killing human pastu. He offers to travel with you across. Roof from the world. Travel. The world crown roof. Same thing, We need to talk about it. Grayson, maybe the wolf will just eat him right now and save me the trouble of this moral blender, because I'm not gonna stop that.

04:06:39

Crazy wolf that could kill me. Although Skech me is evil of the PCs managed to treat with him completely and a useful, ally to them. As they cross the crown of the world in the form, You can serve either as a guard or a scalp for the PC's Caravan.

04:06:54

But as a guard, his presence in parts, a minus two penalty. Took care of its morale score for as long as he a company because he's scary guide, the caravan as soon as it reaches. Yeah, that's sick. Scout seems really useful. Hell. Yeah, that's a chance to kill more of these.

04:07:16

Only I will go with you across the crown.

04:07:24

We would be in your deck. Absolutely appreciate It. Is payment of the debt of my freedom. What's you're there? Our slate is clean. So can I get a TLDR on wear gill and what will happen to this? Dude, if I turn them into the authorities, he is a troll.

04:07:44

The ultimate will just

04:07:49

What are the chances? There's a development section on the troll sorcerer, there's not. Okay, So let me I'll carry him up to where at least as far as dude that he poisoned a bunch is and we'll talk to him and see what he wants to do. Yeah, that you never know.

04:08:11

Maybe he'll be Maybe he'll want something different. Yeah. Why are you bringing that? Is that what he says? Yes, the wolf or the guy the wolf he did offer to surrender and I think he should pay for his crimes. We're going to ask the guy upstairs who need tortured what to do with them.

04:08:38

Yeah. Similar to how you wanted to kill Kevin Dotsu. I think this gentleman may have some words or actions to take with his capture and torture.

04:08:50

I think you can relate.

04:08:56

Few humanoids of strange. This is a lot of efforts fair on an enemy. If everybody's gonna tell me you just kill this dude we could just kill this dude. I'm just neutral evil. Okay, so yeah. He his advice is not the greatest. I'm just gonna say, Well, if you looks like, well, if he's gonna die anyway, I'll just go.

04:09:20

Don't goes gonna ask the local here. The Olfenman, the guide. Do you know what? Abby.

04:09:32

Abby, are you here? You were really out or behind that trip. Nice. I was paying attention, just like yeah I mean it's kind of interactive noise of the days that the moment and paying the listening but not really true of are you familiar with this one going to ask him?

04:09:52

Why does he look like that? I didn't think trolls got that small. Is that like a thing around here? I think there's probably just nothing in the book about it. They're just assumed you would totally kill this guy. No, heat does have a little bit of a backstory. I wake him up and ask him to tell us about his childhood.

04:10:16

Just kidding. Don't do that.

04:10:24

I was born in the first world. No, no. Oh, we're gonna ask all, what do they, what will they do with him? And, like, does he know why he's small? And did he torture them at all? Did he hear about what he did to other people? Maybe.

04:10:46

I am going to remember he would test poisons on most of us. He never touched her.

04:11:02

What would happen to him? If I were to turn him over to whatever the law is, in cows guard in the troll, they eat humans, they will execute him for that crime alone.

04:11:21

That's the thing. Shokos like he deserves to die for what he's done, probably but not for who he is. Let's But I guess in the end, it doesn't matter. Either way, OG's gonna go up and do something really painful for him.

04:11:41

He's gonna he's gonna wake him up. Oh,

04:11:54

Okay, kind of curious because like he said something about Kim and Datsu was right? You humans are all the same and that makes me think that she's been keeping him here like his entire life humanoids. They're humans humans. He's a humans.

04:12:16

You find yourself still alive, you should answer for your crimes but everyone tells me that if I try and do this through the correct legal channels, you will simply be killed. Anyways, tonight while that may be fair justice, it doesn't feel right to just hand you over to die.

04:12:38

Do you have anything to say? Because these may be your last words and if someone has to do it, I kept you here and I should be the one to send you to the next life.

04:12:59

And do not even know how to begin to defend myself against your kinds. You didn't catch me poisoning, prisoners.

04:13:14

It was humans that hunted me and my mother day and night hounding us no matter where we went. It's spits on the floor and instead of white witches, he says white bitches.

04:13:37

So the white witches did stuff to it like the witches of the north. Yep. So humans though, human witches hunted his family. Yep. You and turned him into this.

04:13:55

So let's say I was in a forgiving mood and I decided to let you go. Are you going to return to killing and eat a humans? And poisoning, prisoners and all sorts of evil things upon other unwilling. And unwitting humans going about their lives and you promise humans will.

04:14:14

Stop hunting me. I cannot. Then why would I offer you the same promise?

04:14:27

Oh, she's gonna put him on his knees and he's gonna let him try and say his last piece before he cuts his head off.

04:14:35

He just looks at you in contempt. He is so far, gone. Okay, Here is this report dude story? I'm just gonna post it for you guys. It's actually really gnarly. They rode up a lot for him.

04:14:57

They wrote all, they wrote a lot for him but they don't write like a development for him. That's weird. He is super, super evil, man. And most parties don't really try to talk to akelek. Evil troll. Well, that's how you don't have ochy. That's true. Why we're special That is why we're not spell casts aren't sorcerers aren't non-regenerating sorcerer medium-sized sad backstory characters.

04:15:33

Yeah, so he's actually have spriggin. He was born in the first world.

04:15:41

Is adopted mother was a white witch that you're cutting out. Oops. Sorry, She was a white witch. The found him as a baby. This, this is so much. Oh my god. I know before the white witches of Ericin found out about them.

04:16:04

If you're talking again, we can't hear you, I'm not.

04:16:11

Okay, Ochi cuts his head off.

04:16:21

There's still more to his backstory, like they wrote a lot.

04:16:35

Completely.

04:16:39

So if you're not picking up, what I'm putting down. If you promise him that humans will stop attacking him. I don't know, aka maybe invite him to join your caravan. He could have development. Yeah I would start a redemption are. I'm not gonna make you do that. This is OG's.

04:17:02

Fault that we've dragged this out for so long. I'm gonna cut his head off and then that's gonna be OG's character, develop it, I will accept that as well. Yeah, he his best friend was a talking Raven So you also murdered. He doesn't know. That's great.

04:17:24

We murdered instrument that roads would not be here if goatee wasn't. Yeah, I hope he was not here for him and Dotsu. I hope that you find happiness and peace in the next life and then he's gonna cut his head off for real. These cutting his head off coup de graph.

04:17:48

Oh, I like that last line in his little bioin for that. Where he's the one who acquired the swarm of health loss. Yeah, that's the kind of shade. He's gonna go around and do an OG starting to understand that if he lets people like this go, they're gonna do shit like that because the Pathfinder world is insanely fucked up.

04:18:06

Sometimes it really is. Wait, did no way There you are? No, I want it off. No, well, you guys have been discussing morality again. She's just like continued to stagger off. When you guys probably find her out, I'm a balcony. Looking out. It like the fresh air thinking? Well, that's that.

04:18:29

I guess a bomb. Congratulations. You guys have finished book. Two level up. You knit one? I don't know. Or who knows really? Let me scroll back to the beginning of the book. The Ochi you should look at the party lootless the cell value. Now. Well, we're trapped, holy heck, and turns on your final track.

04:18:59

The final trick. The stairs put us in the wall. We are staircased to nowhere is something we really need to fix. So are you guys okay with me taking the wandera? I don't see a problem with it. There's not just you don't mind me. Taking those lesser bracelets of archery, the work now.

04:19:23

Oh hell yeah, that's sick. Congrats. I mean, you're the only one that can use them, you know? Yeah. Make sure at some point before next time that you go through there and dibs anything that you want and so we can discuss it next time. The pressure on Meltics out on top of the walls, apparently I'm writing the on.

04:19:45

I'm writing our new friend out. I'm simply I think that's probably. Yeah.

04:19:57

But maybe if I take like a level and capital year, you can be my friend forever, winter wolf? Yeah, happened more of the beast is a thing. Nobody recommend it, it really is and Winter. Wolves are just words who are more powerful like their landing can be shifted.

04:20:26

But we are going to come with here because it is almost six five minute day. Excellent work. Everyone. That fight was scary. I was scared for a while. Yeah, that was It wasn't as scary ones from out back. That definitely makes sense a lot more manageable. Um, yeah, I added him getting out.

04:20:51

Okay? Like you planned it or or he gets released by Kim and datsu, he will try to murder you guys and But if bitches invisible and just lets the winter. Will he goes for you guys instead it?

04:21:12
