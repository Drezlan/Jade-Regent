# Introductions

The party meet for the first time in the [[Rusty Dragon]] in [[Sandpoint]]. Either local themselves or with ties to locals they are drawn by the call for goblin heads and the promise of bounty for each one presented to the sheriff [[Belor Hemlock]]. There have been increasing reports of goblin attacks on the locals when travelling past or through [[Brinestump marsh]]. As they learn this news from [[Ameiko Kaijitsu]] she asks them to keep an eye out for her missing shipment of fireworks, having ordered them for the upcoming festival and not recieved them yet, She offers an extra payment for any returned to her. The group asks her if there is any person of expertise on the marsh they may contact to help them locate the goblins. She recommends they speak to a halfling [[Walthus Proudstump]] who lives on the coastal portion of the marsh and to make sure and try his fish stew. Upon entering the swamp the take the northern most road heading west to speak to this halfling. They quickly encounter three goblins playing with fireworks. [[Ochisuite Arashi]] calls out to them to lay down their arms. The Goblins take advantage of the warning and attack one of them blinding Ochi with fireworks. The goblins are dispatched quickly. The bounty hunters continue to the halfing's home [[Walthus' Home]]. On the way they are shadowed by a [[Pale Figure]] who always seems to  be travelling away from them back into the swamp. They continue on and encounter [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons]] bearing the weapons of decidedly foreign origin bearing marks of the dragon empires including wakizashis. They dispatch them. Believing them to be holdouts from prior undead related events from years past they take some of these items and continue on. Arriving at [[Walthus' Home]] they find his behavior on meeting them very strange. After being invited in they are wary but inquire of his famous stew and to sit and ask him some questions about [[Brinestump marsh]] and the [[Licktoad Goblins]] activities. Seeming to not know his own home and finally slurping down a rat in front of them the party decides something is definitely amiss. The [[Walthus Impersonator]] is slain and [[Walthus Proudstump]] is rescued from his refuge in a panic room in the back of his home. Though injured, shaken, and hungry, he will live. As thanks [[Walthus Proudstump]] gifts the heros some potions, treats their wounds, and sits with them to answer their questions. The information given includes the origin of his imposter the strange nature of it's being so far north in the marsh, The location of a witches hut further south and west along the coast. With darkness falling the companions return to the rusty dragon to regroup and collect the bounty for the fireworks and few goblin heads they've aquired. 

### Rest

Returning to [[Brinestump marsh]] with more accurate information they decide they want to investigate this [[Pale Figure]]. Retracting their steps to the point on the path to [[Walthus' Home]] where they saw the creature they set out in the direction it travelled. Finding it to be the [[Soggy Swamp Monster]] and the source of many a missing person from [[Sandpoint]]. They dispatch the creature with [[Ochisuite Arashi]] nearly being felled. They investigate the bodies and bring the information back to town so that the victims families may know peace. They share what they have learned with the sheriff [[Belor Hemlock]] first who rewards them for the good deed.

### Rest

They return to [[Brinestump marsh]] again and head towards the [[Goblin Camp]] to the best of their knowledge. Upon arrival at [[Licktoad Village]] the adventerers find much of it in ruins and possibly exploded. After some investigation they discover the goblins holed up in one of the still standing buildings with the entry boarded up. The group pries the way open and is immediately assualted by seemingly terrified goblins including the [[goblin chief]] on his salamander steed. The Chief won't be reasoned with. They dispatch most of them fairly easily and take one alive with several escaping after the heros understanding that they wish to flee. Ochi insists that they will be of little danger with no chief and their number reduced but [[Grayson]] is very upset by with this sharing his mentor [[Shelalu Andosana]]'s attitude towards [[Sparing the Goblins]]. The captive is very forthcoming about the events leading to their fortification inside the building  informing the party that [[Clak-claks]] came from the south in numbers to collect a chest the goblins had looted from either a [[Shipwreck]] in the area or a [[Cave]]. They seemed disinterested in the goblins once they had it in their possession and returned south towards the cave. The party takes this information, what remains of the goods the goblins recovered (including the separate stolen fireworks), and more goblin ears back to Sandpoint to regroup and rest.

### Rest

Following up on the goblin's information about the [[Clak-claks]] incursion into [[Licktoad Village]] the party travels back to the village and follows the clear path the [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons]] cut back to the [[Cave]] through the swampy undergrowth. On arrival at the cave [[Ochi]] cuts down the vines covering the entrance. They enter and find it fairly normal until they reach pooling water as deep as their shoulders in some places. This is compounded by lack of vision in the darkness. Wading through the water they find the bottom of the body to be slick and difficult to cross. When making their way to the second disconnected exposed landing the [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons]] emerge and attack them. The heros stay close together to call out approaching enemies in the dark. They finish dispatching these skeletons and find another more [[Regal Skeleton]] in the furthest chamber in the back. This skeleton watches them but makes no move until they get close. It lowers it's sword to point it at them as a challenge. [[Ochi]] and [[Grayson]] understand the gesture and [[Grayson]] does not interfere. [[Ochi]] is outmatched and surrenders. The skeleton accepts his surrender and lowers his weapon and turns to dust in front of them leaving [[Tsutamu's Chest]] to the party as well as his weapon the [[Whispering Shrike]]. Inside the chest they find [[Rokuro's letter]] from [[Rokuro Kaijitsu]] to his son [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu]] that mentioned some secret that would be revealed at a later date but never was. The rest of it informs the party that they may find more at the old Kaijitsu settlement of [[Brinewall VIllage]]. They also find inside the chest a richly made fan with a map drawn on one side that marks the shipwrecks in the area [[Kaijitsu Fan map]]. They gather the chest to return to town. On the way out they attempt to take a different route stumbling in to a lair of giant spiders who don't spot them. [[Ochi]] insists that they are hurting no one as they have heard no reports of spiders attacking anyone. [[Grayson]] wants to clear them out for the safety of Sandpoint and the inhabitants of the marsh Ultimately [[Ochi]] wins out arguing they are too wounded to face them and they end up [[Sparing the Spiders]]. They return the way they came and depart towards the [[Brinestump Marsh Witch]]es hut on recommendation from the sheriff that they perform a wellness check. They arrive and knock and call out for her but she does not appear. They enter anyways apologizing and discover that she seems to have been a casualty of her own experiments. While searching the house [[Ochi]] discovers her [[Ratling Familiar]] who screeches at him to leave. Not wanting to be rude he asks the creatures relation to the witch and understands that she was it's mistress. Backing out and apologizing he informs the others and they exit. As they all reach the front and wonder at what will become of the place the Ratling cracks the door and throws out a bag of goods and tells them to leave. The party does.

### Rest

Having returned to [[Sandpoint]] and relaying their discovery to [[Ameiko]], the remaining [[Kaijitsus]], they prepare to depart for [[Brinewall VIllage]] with [[Sandru's Caravan]] including [[Koya]] and [[Shelalu]]. They see it as an adventure. With many having no other reason to stay they all join up. Waiting on certain preparations they spend some time at the [[Rusty Dragon]] mingling and asking and answering questions. [[The Caravan]] sets out. As they near [[Brinewall]] [[Ameiko]] starts appear weak and not herself. They come to a point where the caravan can no longer continue up the path. The party travels the rest of the way on foot. They come on the remains of the place and survey the area. They first check the [[Brinewall Lighthouse]] and find a skeleton key as well as some valuables in a waterproof chest. They bring the chest back to [[Sandru]] and [[The Caravan]]. It's at this point that they realize Ameiko is extremely unwell. Koya determines that she is being possessed by a Kami which is most unusual. While Ameiko is weak it doesn't appear to be doing any harm to her. Through her it keeps repeating a cryptic message. [[Ameiko's Possesion]]

“One treasure beyond two seals in the third vault...”“Beware the birds who wish to fly but cannot...”“A key you seek lies in the grip of the ten-handed one—his fear is your greatest ally...” “Beware the cuckolded cuckoo—it is in his shattered silent love you should seek aid...” “Grandfather waits in the dark, but he knows not who he was...”

 Lacking the ability to help her they return to [[Brinewall VIllage]] believing the possessor is telling them something in [[Brinewall Keep]] is related. They check the [[graveyard]] when they get back and find no familiar names but encounter a fey creature called [[Spivey]] who has been keeping watch against the evil infesting the keep and maintaining the altar to [[Desna]] and the graves. Our Traveller's ask them about the evil. Spivey tells them they saw and felt much, Corbies, Ogres and other worse things. After hearing [[Spivey]]'s information the caravaneers promise to clear the keep so they can be free to travel again. The fey thanks them and blesses the party. They begin investigating the rest of [[Brinewall VIllage]] and come on the corpse of a wyrm ( [[Sea Drake]] ) rotting on the beach slain by manufactured weapons. They approach to get a better look and are beset by Reefclaws. They dispatch the creatures and continue on to [[Brinewall Keep]]. After some careful reconnaissance they spot some Corbie guards who don't notice them. Upon further probing of the perimeter they find purchase through one of the towers. Making their way in they climb the ladder hoping to find a good vantage to gather more information before engaging but are spotted immediately. They engage the Corbies who meet them first. Two retreat across the keep yard and up a wall to the main structure and man a catapult. While they begin eliminating the corbies close to them the others on the catapult open fire but miss. At the same time a grotesque pincered beast [[Flatbelly]] and a giant spider appear and engage the party as well. Beset on two fronts the party begin to panic. Luckily after the firing of their first shot the now obviously dilapidated catapult explodes into splinters and the Corbie operators reengage without it. The party prevails in the melee. Just when they think they are done battling however a giant bat [[Mobat]] like creatures swoops around from the other side of the keep and charges them. They shake off it's piercing howl and strike it as it attempts to swoop down on them. The creature in it's wounded state tries to flee but can't escape [[Grayson]]'s aim who ends it with a final pursuing shot.
The party returns to [[The Caravan]]

### Rest
---

[[Shoko]] Comes looking for [[Koya]] realizing she had departed [[Sandpoint]] and finds the party regrouping at [[The Caravan]]. He joins the party after playing a bit of catch up and hearing of [[Ameiko's Possesion]]. He recalls that [[Brinewall Keep]] is a [[Kaijitsus]] holding from 30 years ago. They set out for the keep again. Arriving at the keep they decide to enter through the front gate this time. Believing they cleared most of the Corbies and other evils from the outer defenses the travelers still proceed cautiously. Inside the gatehouse they find two dead Corbies that the party had no hand in killing which raises some suspicions. In the interest of surprise they peek out windows as they pass them and see some large creatures to the east where they have not been yet. Entering the courtyard again they encounter two wrestling Ogrekin which [[Grayson]] had spotted from the gatehouse. [[Shoko]] casts sleep on them and the party dispatches them while they're unconscious. [[Ochi]] abstains [[Refusing to kill the helpless]]. Shortly after they enter the nearest and most southern room of the keep. Inside they find [[Muthilduh]] who is angry we have killed her harem and strikes [[Ochi]] who is unaware yet of her presence. The party dispatches her also. [[Koya]] heals the not insignificant damage [[Ochi]] took in the engagement. Continuing on into the keep entering the main hall (west) they find several Corbies performing a play for a long-nosed red masked humanoid [[Kokinu]]. They sneak closer and [[Shoko]] tries to put them to sleep as well. He only gets one on the first attempt but gets more on the second. Ochi moves in a strikes the only conscious Corbie and then runs up to the [[Oni]] who has transformed into a winged Tengu form and retreats a little. Trogolodytes pour in from another room off of the hall to the Northeast and engage [[Shoko]] and [[Grayson]] filling the room with a powerful stench. A monitor lizard joins in from the same door also. The party sleeps or kills all the enemies, fighting on two fronts, except the [[Oni]] [[Kokinu]] who retreats by disappearing magically (Dimension Door). The party enters the ballroom off of the main hall (Southwest) and spots him on the balcony a floor up and they pursue. Looking out the arrow slits in their chase they spot some giant insectoid creature dwelling in a small body of water (chillin). The [[Oni]] flees again as more Corbies enter from a series of rooms to the northeast lead by a Corby priest of Pazuzu [[Nevakali]]. The travellers dispatch them all.
Ascending further they find themselves in the living quarters. Checking all the rooms one by one they encounter an [[Attic Whisperer]] and It steals Ochi's voice and is vanquished by the party thanks to [[Koya]] On the walls they discover drawings depicting Oni and Ninja storming the keep and mudering it's inhabitants. They believe the bookcase fell on the boy in the commotion. The other ghostly inhabitant in the halls outside the living quarter is the remnants of the souls of the [[Murdered Brinewallers]]. Koya puts them to rest temporarily and believes that they will find peace when the evil that took their lives and this castle is ousted. Finding much of the rest of the living quarters/ kitchen on the second floor empty with signs of Corbie habitation they also find a defaced shrine to [[Desna]] seeming to be altered to some winged creature the party failed to identify. Koya and the others attempt to clean it up. Afterwards they continue on and up.
At the top of the tower they come across a Harpy. She does not speak to the party verbally but instead they take measure of each other and she gestures for them to come closer. [[Ochi]] does and she touches him and communicates telepathically with him. She tells him she is [[Zaiobe]] and she has lost love for the [[Oni]] who they learn is called [[Kokinu]]. [[Kokinu]] serves something called the [[Ten-handed one]]. [[Zaiobe]] and [[Kokinu]] used to date. She volunteers to aid us in killing [[Kokinu]]. She has lived in [[Brinewall Keep]] for a long time. She tells that there is a [[Vault]] no one has been able to enter thus far. [[Ochi]] tries to communicate this all to his companions through a really terrible game of charades for what is far too long before [[Shoko]] makes him step aside to speed up the process. With Zaiobe in tow they all journey to the dungeon and clear a southern room containing [[Rotscale]] and two other Trogolodytes fighting for his amusement as well as a mostly scoured armory. After which they also discover strange spores in an antechamber off the kitchen to the west and after following that to it's source they find a slime creature (Phycomid) they dispatch from range. Even deeper still they find a proper dungeon containing [[Sluwort]] and some prison cells. Having the jump on him and the aid of some Alchemist's fire via [[Shoko]] and Zaiobe he is quickly ended. Inside one of the Cells the Murder Machine ™ finds one [[Kelda Oxgutter]]. [[Sluwort]] was threatening to eat her. She didn't trust us right away but after a little coaxing her story is revealed. She and her very late party were responsible for the mysterious end of the [[Sea drake]] back in [[Brinewall VIllage]]. She was weak after the ordeal and was captured by the Corbies and Co and brought into [[Brinewall Keep]]. She offered aid and also mentioned that she needs to return home at some point and if we help her back to her home of [[Kalsgard]] her family will reward us. Attempting to continue deeper the caravaneers are confroned with a series of what seem impossibly well locked doors into a cave-like chamber we unlock one of the second lock after jamming the first one and get stopped by the third. Returning and trying another route they spot [[Nindinzego]] and [[Kokinu]] in the cavernous room off the dungeon and attempt to sneak up on them. There is a large drop in the path and in crossing it [[Shoko]] stumbles climbing down and the noise of [[Koya]]'s casting of feather fall alerts the enemies ending their ploy for surprise. Long and grueling fight ensues. There's flying. [[Zaiobe]] and [[Grayson]] carry us. [[Koya]] spends the entire time keeping [[Ochi]] alive. [[Kokinu]] is pretty much out of spells at this point and employs [[Dancing Wasp]] while [[Nindinzego]] flies high above casting down with a wand and nastier things. The party prevails. 

---

[[Zaiobe]] makes it clear that she currently means no harm to the party but considers [[Brinewall Keep]] to be her home and with no further common goal gives them 24 hours to conclude their business there before she will consider them tresspassers and slay them. The party thanks her and goes about just that.
After confirming the death of [[Nindinzego]] and [[Kokinu]] the party climbs up the two sheer drop offs constituting the way from the other dungeon related entrance. Faced with an Iron gate with a woman on it and funerary alcoves branching from the way in perpendicular fashion. Part of the room is collapsed and contains flowing motes of light. Knowledge these Alcoves contain the previous commanders of [[Brinewall]]
Still not having found anything they believe will help [[Ameiko]] they make sure they have searched the entire cavern system and dungeon under [[Brinewall Keep]]. They discover a secret sea cliff walk path that leads straight into the chamber that housed [[Nindinzego]]. 
Making their way back up to make sure they have cleared the ground floor they encounter [[Noe Icemark]], a short [[Varki]] woman with two shortswords at her sides, poking the dead bodies of the trogolodytes the party had killed in the "throne room". [[Noe]] Accompanies us after hearing our business because she loves a mystery. 
Proceeding to the back of the throne room they encounter the only door they had not yet explored due to chasing after [[Kokinu]] earlier. Using a skeleton key they aquired at some point they find It contains a hallway leading to stairs both down and up. As they enter soldiers of blood coagulate into being and instead of attacking thank the adventurers for the death of [[Kokinu]]. One of the next rooms greets them with a decrepit body opening the door which approaches [[Ochi]] and [[Grayson]] and attacks. After dispatching the [[wight]] they enter the room he came from and find it to be an officers quarters in disarray as if raided or attacked. On the desk they find letters addressed to and from [[Andril Kortun]] the commander of [[Brinewall]]. The last of the letters is hastily scribbled and describing the attack on the keep by Ninja and [[Oni]].
The party returns the way it came and then takes the stairs leading downward. There are empty raided vaults here. An Ominous shadowy tian man confronts them. "I know this name" he says and screams in anguish. Weeping he begs them to "Take the seal away from here. Take it to my child." and disappears. Behind him is a Hidden door through which the party find 3 darkwood chests the left and right of which are locked. Opening the middle chest they find a complex and beautiful red and gold filigreed box radiating magic. it is a [[Warding Box]]. Once opened it blinds [[Ochi]] temporarily and the party detects something even more powerful inside. The source is a disc, The [[Amatatsu Seal]]. A vision overtakes the group.

### *Visions of Jade*
*An [[Oni]] army with burning skin, glaring eyes, and sharp tusks, wearing strange armor and wielding exotic weapons—emerge in a storm from a vast forest, then descend upon [[Minkai]]. This vision is swiftly followed by another: [[Emperor Shigure]] dressed in royal robes stands over a simple well, a friend at his side. Suddenly, the friend grows nearly three times in size and is sheathed in a frightening suit of jade armor. The [[Jade Warrior]] draws a sword and strikes down his royal friend, then holds the bloody sword aloft in triumph. A third vision follows, this time of [[Tsutoku Amatatsu]] a.k.a. [[Rokuro Kaijitsu]] handing the legendary sentient sword [[Te No Sui]] to a richly dressed [[Ulfen]] man, [[Fynn Snaevald]], in exchange for a bag of gold to fund his families flight. Finally, this vision fades, and we see [[Ameiko Amatatsu]] waking from [[Ameiko's Possesion]] as the [[Kami]] possesing her flys back into the seal, but she is dressed in the finery of an empress. She rises from sleep not in [[The Caravan]], but from a resting spot within the arms of a jade throne.*

These visions pass in the span of a few heartbeats, and after they do, the [[Amatatsu Scions]] are left with the knowledge that they are just that, That [[Te No Sui]] may have even more knowledge of the [[Amatatsu]]'s legacy, That [[Ameiko Amatatsu]] is the heir to the [[Amatatsu]] royal family and rightful heir of the [[Jade Throne]] of [[Minkai]], and that the [[Warding Box]] has protected the [[Amatatsu Seal]] from detection by the [[Oni of the Five Storms]] for this long and having the opened it they have revealed themselves to great danger.
With this knowledge the party opens the other chests finding more treasures that appear tailored to their strengths and quickly gather up those items and the [[Warding Box]] to make haste back to [[The Caravan]] and [[Ameiko]]. They discover quite quickly that she is waiting for them back in the throne room. She confirms she also shared in the vision. [[Ochi]] swears himself to her service and in gratitude and her newfound right grants him the title of [[Samurai]]. [[Shoko]] Warns her that she can throw the [[Warding Box]] into the sea and forget it all. [[Ameiko]] says she cannot stand by and allow the suffering under the [[Jade Regent]]. [[Noe]] asks what she will do. She believes her responsibility to the [[Minkai]]an people too great in spite of no wish to rule.
With all of these thoughts weighing on the party they make their way back to [[The Caravan]] where they determine they will head north to [[Kalsgard]] to inquire after the sword [[Te No Sui]] and the way further north to [[The Crown of the World]] and the northern passage to [[Minkai]]. After that is determined they ask more of [[Noe]]'s reasons for being at [[Brinewall]]. She says she is from very far north. Went south for "Mother's interest in chronicalling knowledge". Mother sent her to "learn about her own culture." With all the sharing going around and various bits of [[Minkai]]an spoken [[Ochi]] notices [[Shoko]] speaks the tongue as well and asks how he came to be in [[Varisia]] being from [[Minkai]] himself. [[Shoko]] says he "came here a long time ago after altercation back in [[Minkai]] and was saved by [[Koya]] when in troubles here." All the while [[Grayson]] shares hot food and strong drink with [[Kelda Oxgutter]] once again keeping up the groups hospitality. With that the party retires and rests with a long journey ahead of them.

### Rest

Those on watch hear the scrape of wood on sandy gravel as a longship beaches on the shores near [[The Caravan]]. Having been detected the [[Ulfen]] Raider's let loose cries and set upon the camp. The Scions rouse and arm themselves to take up the defense as well as [[Ameiko]], [[Sandru]], [[Koya]], and [[Kelda]]. [[Ochi]] rushes to aid [[Koya]] in her caravan after seeing several raiders enter as he does he spies a large peculiar [[Raven]] with a red feather on it's breast which flies off into the night when spotted. The fight ends with the capture of one of the [[Ulfen]]. The party determines to interrogate him. When he is less than forthcoming [[Ochi]] threatens to tie stones to the mans feet and send him into the river he came from. The man begins bleeding from his eyes and ears and quickly dies. Confused the party see if the man lives and search his body. They discover a symbol branded on his chest and identify it as a [[Blood Geas]], A mark left by the weapon [[Oathtaker]] a Tetsubo. After discussing they also determine that the longship bearing their attackers is the [[Arl's Hammer]] belonging to [[Asvig Longthews]]. Some in the party share that he is the husband of [[Helva]] who is the real power between the two and a powerful witch. Pondering the thought of a powerful necromancer against them and the mysterious [[Raven]] as well as the social and politcal implications of this attack they make a plan to split their forces to enter [[Kalsgard]] in a way to be both less and more conspicuous to draw danger away from [[Ameiko]].
Come morning with their plan in action they draw near to the city aboard the [[Arl's Hammer]] when a strange golden [[Flying Monkey]] lands upon the bow of the boat. Calmly smoking a pipe, He is unresponsive to their questions or actions at first. Soon however the [[xiao]] communicates to them that he is named [[Wei Yan]] and that he is an emissary of [[Shizuru]] come to watch over [[Ameiko]]. With this new addition they seek out a place to stay and gather information. Over a mix of [[Tian]] and [[Ulfen]] food and drink they as the tavern keep if there is anyone who could guide them north. They are recommended [[Ulf Gormunder]] or his apprentice [[Ukshaka]]. They also inquire about [[Fynn Snaevald]] and where he can be found. They determine to speak to [[Fynn]] first and set out for his house.
Before reaching their destination the come to a bridge with two statues on the siderails. Upon crossing the statues come to life and attack them. They dispatch them fairly easily. Afterwards they find the traces of the sigils that constituted a trap that must have been laid for them.
Continuing on to the ex-trader's house they are greeted by his house servant and welcomed in. They introduce themselves and their reason for visiting. [[Fynn]] tells them he no longer has [[Te No Sui]]. He kept it all this time and had always planned to return it to [[Rokuro]] but he never returned. He had housed and fed [[Rokuro]] during his families flight and wished them well. About two weeks past thugs in all black dress broke in and stole it leaving only a black [[Raven]] feather behind. [[Noe]] thinks these are the signs of the [[Frozen Shadows]]. [[Ochi]] shows [[Fynn]] the swords he got from the secret third [[Vault]], [[Fynn]] admires them and thanks him. At this time a page arrives bearing a scroll for [[Fynn]]. It contains a declaration of a blood feud between [[Fynn]] and [[Asvig Longthews]] over unpaid wereguilt. At this point the party decides they need to pay [[Asvig]] a visit.
Sharing all knowledge they have or have gathered on him they focus on the news that they are feasting in celebration of a funeral. [[Snorri Stoneye]] the mad reaver has just passed. He was a very powerful raider who plundered the [[Sotlands]] to the south financed by the [[Rimerunners]]. He fell ill on a recent journey and died very quickly. His assets were sold back to the [[Rimerunners]] before he was even fully dead.
They arrive at the [[Asvig]]'s hall and opt for stealth and reconaissance. Listening at different points of entry and examining the area they determine there are a large number of [[Ulfen]] raiders present and return to town to gather more fighters from [[The Caravan]]. Returning in greater force [[The Caravan]]eers debate points of entry and whether or not to burn their enemies out finally deciding on storming the rear entrance in force. Making their way in they dispatch a few who are harrassing the kitchen help whom they detain and question. Not finding much information they continue into the long hall where they come upon the scene of [[Helva]] bedding raiders in celebration with many drunken others passed out about the place. [[Asvig]] and those coherent charge and the [[Witch]] starts working magics. Beating down the sober, slaying [[Asvig]], and holding [[Helva]] at swordpoint they question her. 

---

She tells them that they stole the sword and an older/middle aged tian woman who walked like a figher paid them well for it. They hid the sword in a place no one will ever find it again. inferring the worst the scions belive they have put the sword aboard [[Snorri's Funeral Ship]]. the scions press [[Helva]] further and she relays that they did not kill [[Snorri Stoneye]] nor were they the ones who left a feather after stealing [[Te No Sui]]. [[Helva]] having shared this information attempts to kill [[Noe]] and [[Ochi]] intervenes preventing a 1 on 1 fight. As [[Helva]] passes strange and ominous flames forming a death's head rise from her corpse in the mark of [[Urgathoa]]. The remaing living raiders are offered work with the caravan and head back to join up. Determined to find [[Snorri's Funeral Ship]] the party quickly heads south and find [[Ukshaka]], [[Ulf Gormunder]]'s apprentice asking us to find him and if we can to bring him to [[Yin Po]] at the shrine of [[Shelyn]] in the [[Fire Quarter]]. [[Ukshaka]] tells the party the location of spear shatter harbor. After finding the location of the ship and with the notion that the missing [[Ulf Gormunder]] may be aboard along with the sword they make haste. As they approach those with knowledge of the procedure of these cultural funeral ships share it. Taking three small boats out to ferry they party they close on the funeral ship but are interrupted by a giant crab intent on feasting on them. They dispatch it and board.
[[Ochi]] quickly disables the time released fire starting method. The pass up the body on the pyre and head below decks finding it piled high with treasures but hearing the sounds of movement and chains rattling in the dark. Chained on a long lead is the dead [[Snorri Stoneye]] who is now a draugr. As they discover this there is a commotion above decks and peering back up they find [[Wei Yan]] unconscious and [[Ameiko]] missing and several figures garbed in black poised to attack as lightining unexpectedly strikes the ship setting it ablaze. Most of the party scrambles to get back above decks to recover [[Ameiko]] and [[Grayson]] fells the unliving [[Snorri]] below and quickly searches for [[Te No Sui]] and [[Ulf]]. Those above dispatch the [[Frozen Shadows]] assaulting them and [[Grayson]] find neither objects of his search but instead finds [[Zio]] bound and gagged and a strange [[Talking Helmet]]. Releasing him and making haste back up and off the ship the fire is staunched and they turn to questioning the one ninja they had not killed who quickly chooses death by leaping into the deep over betrayal.
Finding [[Ameiko]] nowhere in sight and none of what they came for the scions regroup sailing back to shor. Introducing himself [[Helgarval]] shares that he is was a familiar to a wizard who died and is now stranded on the material plane. He has spent a great deal of time following the movements of the [[Frozen Shadows]] since. On the way back to [[Kalsgard]] they discuss the [[Frozen Shadows]] hunting them and their knowledge of the group with [[Helgarval]] sharing that they have been using the [[Rimerunners]] as a front for the last few years.
With few leads the scions make way to the [[Kalsgard Shelyn Temple]] which they find crumbling and burning on their approach with screams coming from inside. Entering they see an Earth elemental standing over the body of an injured priest and hear "Leave the priest, Kill them" screeched from somwhere in the dark. The party engages the earthen behemoth while the voice from the dark urges it to kill them. During the fight it is identified as the [[Red Feather Raven]] that has been ahead of them at every turn. [[Grayson]] gifts several arrows to it before it flees as the group reduces the earth elemental to dust.

Noe identifies it as being dosed with blue winnis poison
Wei yan was also poked with this probably on the funeral ship when Ameiko was taken
Shoko calls down to see if anyone is trapped in the cellar
No one responds
Noe "The Shadows have three individuals of interest"
Grayson "Why would they take the guide and the assistant"
GM from koya maybe? "My theory is that they are trying to hamper our progress on every avenue. Even if we rescue Ameiko we won't get far without Ulf or Ukshaka."
"Especially in winter"
"Good news is if they are using winnis do you know how hard it is to grow. The rarity makes it easily linkable to the shadows. Wherever we find this we will probably find the shadow"
Ochi "do where know where the rime runners base is?"
Noe "Jade quarter but Idk exactly"
Helgarval "I know where it is"
Ochi "lets go digging in the rime runners spot then"
Noe "They wont have ameiko at the guild or anything so easily tracible"
Helgarval "I hoped the location of the base would be there"
Shoko "It's practically our only lead"
H: "Its been very active these last few months"
Ochi "Seems like a trap"
Noe "name drop can't keep the whole clan equipped without some kind of legistlation"
H: "Im too conspicuous"
Caravan is in bone quarter
Party has rooms at the inn
Discussion about wearing the helmet or backpacking him whether his eyes glow. Stash or bring
Discuss gather information and staking out the rime runners decide to go to the inn and gather info.
Shelyn Xin Po priest offers healing and to come back if we ever need more.

Ochi "can we storm the rime runners?"
Noe "If you want us all to die. They know everything about us. I know how they work. Let me stake it out. We've been picking them off maybe they're getting weak. Perhaps I can kidnap one and Ochi can tie rocks to their feet"
Ochi " I can come with you"
They discuss if Ochi can keep up on the stakeout climbing, stealth, noe says I'm boss at this shit bruv you'll hold me back
Ochi insists

As we approach the tavern
Perception
Koya takes an arrow through the shoulder and screams (crit nearly to death)
We all see on the tavern balcony a viking archer woman badass heckya
Zio pulls out a potion and gives it to koya
Shoko illusions the door away so she can't escape the balcony
Ochi zooms up hoping to climb up and get stabby with her
Grayson shoots the bowwoman a few times
She takes several shots at ochi from the balcony missing
Noe makes a handsign runs up to ochi and jumps off him right onto the balcony infront of the bowwoman
Heckya "shit they didn't say anything about one of you being in the group" Skald
Noe "yeah they don’t tell you lots of things these days I've realized" Skald
Zio whiffs with crossbow
Shoko misses with something not specified audibly
Koya hits with probably a starknife attack
Hekya gets wounded enough to run and heads for the alley but noe and ochi catch up
With Noe grappling and Ochi holding a sword to her throat Ochi urges her to lay down her arms
Hekya "They're not paying enough for this" Skald
Noe "you said you were paid to do this, come on then details"
Ochi "who hired you?"
He "I was hired to kill at least one of you"
Ochi "anyone specific?"
He "No just reduce your number by 1"
He "I was paid by a large ulfen man, some call him jorgun the axe"
Knowledge local but Noe already knows
Werebear that is bound by a blood geas
Werebears are usually lawful good
N "jorgun paid you where and when"
He "a few blocks from here. I met him because I am one of the better trackers and snipers in kalsgard"
N "quality has gone down but that was a good shot"
Word around town is he works for the frozen shadows
Shoko " we should find him and tail him"
O "tell us about the frozen shadows"
He "what everyone else knows they're a ghost story to scare children"
Shoko " these are real"
We can turn her over to the law
N "if you want her dead in a cell by morning"
G "what if we hire her""shes a good shot and a good tracker""idk about trusting her"
S "def not she was about to kill in cold blood for money"
He "what if I just give you the money I was paid and we go our separate ways"
Ochi "youre no threat you can be on your way"
He "no job is worth my life, thank you for that, if you look for jorgun he left the city, I trail all of my contracts as a habit he left town going north"
Knowledge local snorri stoneyes fortress ravenscragg naturally and artificially fortified, 80ft cliff location. Only one way in mountain pass. Close enough to foray from.
N "Raven's cragg? Might be big enough" 
N "you've been a delight what did you say your name was? Well Hekya you can keep both of your hands, I was going to take one to teach you to never do this shit again. Consider that my mercy"
Ochi "You should probably leave town quickly it is no longer safe for you here" *offers to shake hands and intimidates with a strong grip* success
Out of nothing a ninja woman appears and eviscerates Hekya with her bare hand through her throat
N "That's about what I was expecting"
W "you dissapoint me student"
N "Sensei"
N "The master must be running thin if they're sending you out"
W "you have made so much noise"

N "that is omeyani she probably can"
G "is this someone we shouldn't be attacking?"
N "you want her dead… sorry sensei"
W "I would be dissappointed if you did otherwise"
Very long and grueling combat
Zio boneshakers her everyone else keeps chasing around this invisible woman zio casts see invisibility. The others rely on seeing where she last disappeared to try and attack where they believed her to be. Grayson gets off a good flurry of arrows early putting two arrows in her as she catches the third. Noe attempts to use the same tricks against her disappearing as well waiting for a good moment to strike. Eventually the party gets enough hits to cause her to flee. 
W "we will meet again and next time I will be ready for you
She runs up the side of the building onto the roof and dashes off. Noe leaps up after her but she has disappeared again. As her invisibility melts off she rejoins the party in the alley
Grayson and Ochi check on Hekya to see if she is still alive. She is very dead
N "you may want to be careful will that, standard protocol is to poison"
We find a horse around the corner
Craft poisons Not a poison Noe has used before
Shoko "friend of yours?" directed at Noe
N "not exactly no"
S "I was being facetious, that was your sensei?"
O "so that’s where you learned all these tricks"
N "ah yes you do know that word don’t you i forgot about that, bit slow on the uptake aren't you?"
N "if you'd like a full conversation about this can we not do it next to a dead body in an alley? I'd hate for the law to be involved. It's not good for business"
S "we cant go to the inn we have assassins after us"
O "can we noe? Are we safe"
N "my professional opinion? Oh now we're listening to me. That woman was my teacher Omeyani I haven't been in kalsgard in a decade but its good to know shes got a handle on things. If they're sending her after us they're really low on manpower or they're really actually trying to kill us im guessing the latter. Given that it didn't work we probably have 24 hours before they can put together another attempt."

N "hopefully we can keep picking them off"
O "cool you guys want a drink? Sake? Sake? Sake?"
G "never had it"
S "do you suppose the old trader man is okay? They tried to kill us"
N "I don’t think they’ll waste time on him. Not with how many we've killed"
O "Koya how are you feeling?"
K "I'm healed but ill be feeling the weather in that one for a while"

recap
came back from the [[funeral ship]] and aquired [[zio]] and [[helgarval]] and made our way to the [[shrine or temple of shelyn]] and saved the priest xin po or [[yin po]] from the [[redfeather raven]] and the [[earth elemental]] and found out that [[~~ulf~~]] [[Ukshaka]] wasnt there they had broken into the [[safe house]] to get him and found a tengu feather and a blowgun dart on the ground. With [[Ameiko]] missing still and the [[Frozen Shadows]] several step ahead of them they regrouped at the tavern when on approach [[Koya]] was nearly killed by [[Heckja]] in an ambush. Closing on her swiftly and intimidating her into surrender we were getting lots of great info from her like that [[Jorgun the Axe]] the [[Werebear]] hired her and that he was under a [[Blood Geas]] and came from the north with [[Hatsuyuki no Naoto]] inferring from that that the [[Frozen Shadows]] were probably operating out of [[Snorri Stoneye]]'s old fortress of [[Ravens Cragg]] as it was one of the only places from that direction that could house their forces with close access to [[Kalsgard]] all before [[omeyani]] appeared out of thin air eviscerating her throat from behind with her bare hands. The party struggled to fight her with her ability to disappear and reappear only to snatch [[Grayson]]'s arrows out of the air and [[Zio]] was the only one with the ability to see her. She disappeared after a time leaving them with only a poisoned shuriken stuck in the alley wall, a dead failed assassin, and more questions. What we did learn though was [[Noe]]'s secrets as we questioned her after [[omeyani]] addressed her as student and [[Noe]] addressed her as sensei. They sat at the tavern and discussed the danger they were in. Between [[Helgarval]] and [[Hatsuyuki no Naoto]] we learned of [[Kimmendatsu]], [[omeyani]], more about their front the [[Rimerunners]] guild. 
To illustrate how bad the danger was [[Noe]] also demonstrated a poison over drinks and [[Grayson]] showed his fortitude and fearlessness by drinking it in front of everyone. She further elaborates by impressing that others, but not all, within the [[Frozen Shadows]] share the abilities [[omeyani]] and [[Noe]] demonstrated such as enhanced speed and strength and the ability to vanish. She also pointed out that the [[redfeather raven]] was known to her as a friend or associate of [[omeyani]] but she believed it to be a tengu and not an actual raven.
Having learned all that the party determines they need rest before they act and that they will take watches and recuperate at an inn in the [[Ivory Quarter]] while [[Noe]] does some reconaissance on the [[Rimerunners]]. In the morning the party does some shopping on the way to prepare for some of the tricks that they've seen from the [[Frozen Shadows]] so far.
While this is going [[Noe]] is carefully watching the [[Rimerunners]] building noting the points of egress and the guards number and shift changes. Only one windows is boarded up and barred. With careful prodding she finds an easy way in and finds herself in an empty office. FInding nothing of interest she continues on to more rooms peering through a keyhole she passes on a room with two lounging guards for a different locked one and picks the lock. It appears to be a storage closet at first but after careful searching she finds a secret door behind a panel. Inside she finds a trapdoor in the floor to another storage location, this one containing a heavy iron lockbox against the north wall. After bypassing the lock on that as well she finds it contains two thousand gold pieces as well as some very importnat looking ledgers and paperwork. Gathering these pilfered treasures up and peering through another portal she decides she's risked enough on her own and makes a mental note of the secret rooms location and carefully covers her tracks and makes her exit. Returning to the others flipping some of her spoils she, [[Ochi]], and [[Shoko]] gather everyone to go over [[Noe]]'s findings.
The [[Stolen Documents]] confirm that the [[Arl's Hammer]] was rented to [[Asvig Longthews]] on the night of the attack at [[Skalsbridge]] and also that he was contracted by the [[Rimerunners]] to aquire a [[Tian]] artifact from a specific address recognizable as [[Fynn Snaevald]]'s home. They also detail financial transactions of large sums over the last few years to [[Ravens Cragg]] including the artifact which is likely [[Te No Sui]]. All of these orders were approved by someone called [[Thorborg Silverskorr]] who is apparently the owner of the [[Rimerunners]]. Also included is the purchase of [[Ravens Cragg]] from [[Snorri]] several years ago.
While the group is pondering these revelations and confirmations [[Shoko]] raises the idea of using some of this information as a bargaining chip, taking these damning documents and meeting with the [[Rimerunners]] and using them to barter to get [[Ukshaka]] back, assuming that if they don't outright have her there then they'll know her location and we can liberate her without any bloodshed. The others are amenable to this idea 

The caravan is in the bone quarter we are in the ivory quarter
rimerunners is in the jade quarter
