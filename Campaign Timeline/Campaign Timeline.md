 # Introductions

The party meet for the first time in the [[Rusty Dragon]] in [[Sandpoint]]. Either local themselves or with ties to locals they are drawn by the call for goblin heads and the promise of bounty for each one presented to [[Belor Hemlock|the sheriff]] [[Belor Hemlock]]. There have been increasing reports of goblin attacks on the locals when travelling past or through [[Brinestump marsh]]. As they learn this news from [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko Kaijitsu]] she asks them to keep an eye out for her missing shipment of fireworks. Having ordered them for the upcoming festival and not recieved them yet, she offers an extra payment for any returned to her. The group asks her if there is any person of expertise on the marsh they may contact to help them locate the goblins. She recommends they speak to a halfling [[Walthus Proudstump]] who lives on the coastal portion of the marsh and to make sure and try his fish stew. Upon entering the swamp they take the northern-most road heading west to speak to this halfling. They quickly encounter three goblins playing with fireworks. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] calls out to them to lay down their arms. The Goblins take advantage of the warning and attack one of them blinding [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] with fireworks. The goblins are dispatched quickly. The bounty hunters continue to the halfing's home [[Walthus' Home]]. On the way they are shadowed by a [[Sinspawn|Pale Figure]] who always seems to be travelling away from them back into the swamp. They continue on and encounter [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons|Skeletons]] bearing the weapons of decidedly foreign origin bearing marks of the [[Tian Xia|Dragon Empires]] including wakizashis. They dispatch them. Believing them to be holdouts from prior undead related events from years past they take some of these items and continue on. Arriving at [[Walthus' Home]] they find his behavior on meeting them very strange. After being invited in they are wary but inquire of his famous stew and to sit and ask him some questions about [[Brinestump marsh]] and the [[Licktoad Goblins]] activities. Seeming to not know his own home and finally slurping down a rat in front of them the party decides something is definitely amiss. The [[Faceless Stalker]] is slain and [[Walthus Proudstump]] is rescued from his refuge in a panic room in the back of his home. Though injured, shaken, and hungry, he will live. As thanks [[Walthus Proudstump]] gifts the heros some potions, treats their wounds, and sits with them to answer their questions. The information given includes the origin of his imposter the strange nature of it's being so far north in the marsh, The location of a witches hut further south and west along the coast. With darkness falling the companions return to the [[Rusty Dragon]] to regroup and collect the bounty for the fireworks and few goblin heads they've aquired.

# The [[Sinspawn|Pale Figure]] and The Village

Returning to [[Brinestump marsh]] with more accurate information they decide they want to investigate this [[Sinspawn|Pale Figure]]. Retracting their steps to the point on the path to [[Walthus' Home]] where they saw the creature they set out in the direction it travelled. Finding it to be the [[Sinspawn]] and the source of many a missing person from [[Sandpoint]]. They dispatch the creature with [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] nearly being felled. They investigate the bodies and bring the information back to town so that the victims families may know peace. They share what they have learned with the sheriff [[Belor Hemlock]] first who rewards them for the good deed.

They return to [[Brinestump marsh]] again and head towards the [[Licktoad Village|Goblin Camp]] to the best of their knowledge. Upon arrival at [[Licktoad Village]] the adventerers find much of it in ruins and possibly exploded. After some investigation they discover the goblins holed up in one of the still standing buildings with the entry boarded up. The group pries the way open and is immediately assualted by seemingly terrified goblins including the [[Randwattle Gutwad|Goblin Chief]] on his salamander steed. [[Randwattle Gutwad|The Chief]] won't be reasoned with. They dispatch most of them fairly easily and take one alive with several escaping after the heros understanding that they wish to flee. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] insists that they will be of little danger with no chief and their number reduced but [[Grayson]] is very upset by with this sharing his mentor [[Shelalu Andosana]]'s attitude towards [[Sparing the Goblins|sparing Goblins]]. The captive is very forthcoming about the events leading to their fortification inside the building Â informing the party that [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons|Clak-Claks]] came from the south in numbers to collect [[Tsutamu's Chest|a chest]] the goblins had looted from either a [[Shipwreck]] in the area or a [[Tsutamu's Cave|Cave]]. They seemed disinterested in the goblins once they had it in their possession and returned south towards [[Tsutamu's Cave|The Cave]]. The party takes this information, what remains of the goods the goblins recovered (including the separate stolen fireworks), and more goblin ears back to [[Sandpoint]] to regroup and rest.

# [[Tsutamu's Cave|The Cave]] and The Letter
Following up on the goblin's information about the [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons|Clak-Claks]] incursion into [[Licktoad Village]] the party travels back to the village and follows the clear path the [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons|Skeletons]] cut back to [[Tsutamu's Cave|The Cave]] through the swampy undergrowth. On arrival at the [[Tsutamu's Cave|Cave]] [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] cuts down the vines covering the entrance. They enter and find it fairly normal until they reach pooling water as deep as their shoulders in some places. This is compounded by lack of vision in the darkness. Wading through the water they find the bottom of the body to be slick and difficult to cross. When making their way to the second disconnected exposed landing the [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons|Skeletons]] emerge and attack them. The heros stay close together to call out approaching enemies in the dark. They finish dispatching these [[Kaitjitsu Clan Skeletons|skeletons]] and find another more [[Tsutamu|Regal Skeleton]] in the furthest chamber in the back. This skeleton watches them but makes no move until they get close. It lowers it's sword to point it at them as a challenge. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and [[Grayson]] understand the gesture and [[Grayson]] does not interfere. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] is outmatched and surrenders. The skeleton accepts his surrender and lowers his weapon and turns to dust in front of them leaving [[Tsutamu's Chest|a chest]] to the party as well as his weapon the [[Whispering Shrike]]. Inside the [[Tsutamu's Chest|chest]] they find [[Rokuro's letter|a letter]] from [[Tsutoku Amatatsu|Rokuro Kaijitsu]] to his son [[Lonjiku Kaijitsu]] that mentioned some secret that would be revealed at a later date but never was. The rest of it informs the party that they may find more at the old [[The Amatatsu|Kaijitsu]] settlement of [[Brinewall Village]]. They also find inside the [[Tsutamu's Chest|chest]] a richly made [[Kaijitsu Fan map|Fan]] with a map drawn on one side that marks the shipwrecks in the area. They gather the [[Tsutamu's Chest|chest]] to return to town. On the way out they attempt to take a different route stumbling in to a lair of giant spiders who don't spot them. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] insists that they are hurting no one as they have heard no reports of spiders attacking anyone. [[Grayson]] wants to clear them out for the safety of [[Sandpoint]] and the inhabitants of the marsh Ultimately [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] wins out arguing they are too wounded to face them and they end up avoiding the spiders. They return the way they came and depart towards the [[Brinestump Marsh Witch]]es hut on recommendation from [[Belor Hemlock|The Sheriff]] that they perform a wellness check. They arrive and knock and call out for her but she does not appear. They enter anyways apologizing and discover that she seems to have been a casualty of her own experiments. While searching the house [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] discovers her [[Ratling Familiar]] who screeches at him to leave. Not wanting to be rude he asks the creatures relation to the [[Brinestump Marsh Witch]] and understands that she was it's mistress. Backing out and apologizing he informs the others and they exit. As they all reach the front and wonder at what will become of the place the Ratling cracks the door and throws out a bag of goods and tells them to leave. The party does.

# The Possession and The Keep
Having returned to [[Sandpoint]] and relaying their discovery to [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]], the remaining [[The Amatatsu|Kaijitsus]], they prepare to depart for [[Brinewall Village]] with [[Caravan|Sandru's caravan]] including [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] and [[Shelalu Andosana|Shelalu]]. They see it as an adventure. With many having no other reason to stay they all join up. Waiting on certain preparations they spend some time at the [[Rusty Dragon]] mingling and asking and answering questions. [[Caravan|The Caravan]] sets out. As they near [[Brinewall Village]] [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] starts appear weak and not herself. They come to a point where [[Caravan|The Caravan]] can no longer continue up the path. The party travels the rest of the way on foot. They come on the remains of the place and survey the area. They first check the [[Brinewall Lighthouse]] and find a skeleton key as well as some valuables in a waterproof chest. They bring the chest back to [[Sandru Vhiski|Sandru]] and [[Caravan|The Caravan]]. It's at this point that they realize [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] is extremely unwell. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] determines that she is being possessed by a [[Kami]] which is most unusual. While [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] is weak it doesn't appear to be doing any harm to her. Through her it keeps repeating a cryptic message. [[Ameiko's Possession]]

>*âOne treasure beyond two seals in the [[Third Vault]]...â 
>âBeware the birds who wish to fly but cannot...â
>âA key you seek lies in the grip of the [[Nindinzego|Ten-Handed One]]âhis fear is your greatest ally...â
>âBeware the cuckolded cuckooâit is in his shattered silent love you should seek aid...â
>âGrandfather waits in the dark, but he knows not who he was...â*

Lacking the ability to help her they return to [[Brinewall Village]] believing the possessor is telling them something in [[Brinewall keep]] is related. They check [[Brinewall Graveyard|The Graveyard]] when they get back and find no familiar names but encounter a fey creature called [[Spivey]] who has been keeping watch against the evil infesting the keep and maintaining the altar to [[Desna]] and the graves. Our Traveller's ask them about the evil. [[Spivey]] tells them they saw and felt much, [[Corby]]s, Ogres and other worse things. After hearing [[Spivey]]'s information the caravaneers promise to clear the keep so they can be free to travel again. The fey thanks them and blesses the party. They begin investigating the rest of [[Brinewall Village]] and come on the corpse of a [[Sea Drake|Wyrm]] rotting on the beach slain by manufactured weapons. They approach to get a better look and are beset by Reefclaws. They dispatch the creatures and continue on to [[Brinewall keep]]. After some careful reconnaissance they spot some [[Corby]] guards who don't notice them. Upon further probing of the perimeter they find purchase through one of the towers. Making their way in they climb the ladder hoping to find a good vantage to gather more information before engaging but are spotted immediately. They engage the [[Corby]]s who meet them first. Two retreat across the keep yard and up a wall to the main structure and man a catapult. While they begin eliminating the corbies close to them the others on the catapult open fire but miss. At the same time a grotesque pincered beast [[Flatbelly]] and a giant spider appear and engage the party as well. Beset on two fronts the party begin to panic. Luckily after the firing of their first shot the now obviously dilapidated catapult explodes into splinters and the [[Corby]] operators reengage without it. The party prevails in the melee. Just when they think they are done battling however a giant bat [[Mobat]] like creatures swoops around from the other side of the keep and charges them. They shake off it's piercing howl and strike it as it attempts to swoop down on them. The creature in it's wounded state tries to flee but can't escape [[Grayson]]'s aim who ends it with a final pursuing shot.
The party returns to [[Caravan|The Caravan]]

# [[Kikonu|The Oni]] and The Harpy
[[Shoko]] Comes looking for [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] realizing she had departed [[Sandpoint]] and finds the party regrouping at [[Caravan|The Caravan]]. He joins the party after playing a bit of catch up and hearing of [[Ameiko's Possession]]. He recalls that [[Brinewall keep]] is a [[The Amatatsu|Kaijitsu]] holding from 30 years ago. They set out for the keep again. Arriving at the keep they decide to enter through the front gate this time. Believing they cleared most of the [[Corby]]s and other evils from the outer defenses the travelers still proceed cautiously. Inside the gatehouse they find two dead [[Corby]]s that the party had no hand in killing which raises some suspicions. In the interest of surprise they peek out windows as they pass them and see some large creatures to the east where they have not been yet. Entering the courtyard again they encounter two wrestling Ogrekin which [[Grayson]] had spotted from the gatehouse. [[Shoko]] casts sleep on them and the party dispatches them while they're unconscious. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] abstains [[Refusing to kill the helpless]]. Shortly after they enter the nearest and most southern room of the keep. Inside they find [[Muthilduh]] who is angry we have killed her harem and strikes [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] who is unaware yet of her presence. The party dispatches her also. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] heals the not insignificant damage [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] took in the engagement. Continuing on into the keep entering the main hall (west) they find several [[Corby]]s performing a play for a long-nosed red masked humanoid [[Kikonu]]. They sneak closer and [[Shoko]] tries to put them to sleep as well. He only gets one on the first attempt but gets more on the second. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] moves in a strikes the only conscious [[Corby]] and then runs up to [[Kikonu|the Oni]] who has transformed into a winged [[Tengu]] form and retreats a little. [[Trogolodytes]] pour in from another room off of the hall to the Northeast and engage [[Shoko]] and [[Grayson]] filling the room with a powerful stench. A monitor lizard joins in from the same door also. The party sleeps or kills all the enemies, fighting on two fronts, except the Oni [[Kikonu]] who retreats by disappearing magically [^2] . The party enters the ballroom off of the main hall (Southwest) and spots him on the balcony a floor up and they pursue. Looking out the arrow slits in their chase they spot some giant insectoid creature dwelling in a small body of water (chillin). The [[Kikonu|Oni]] flees again as more [[Corby]]s enter from a series of rooms to the northeast lead by a [[Corby]] priest of [[Pazuzu]] [[Nevakali]]. The travellers dispatch them all.
Ascending further they find themselves in the living quarters. Checking all the rooms one by one they encounter an [[Attic Whisperer]] and It steals [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]'s voice and is vanquished by the party thanks to [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] On the walls they discover drawings depicting [[Oni]] and Ninja storming the keep and mudering it's inhabitants. They believe the bookcase fell on the boy in the commotion. The other ghostly inhabitant in the halls outside the living quarter is the remnants of the souls of the [[Murdered Brinewallers]]. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] puts them to rest temporarily and believes that they will find peace when the evil that took their lives and this castle is ousted. Finding much of the rest of the living quarters/ kitchen on the second floor empty with signs of [[Corby]] habitation they also find a defaced shrine to [[Desna]] seeming to be altered to some winged creature the party failed to identify. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] and the others attempt to clean it up. Afterwards they continue on and up.
At the top of the tower they come across a [[Harpy]]. She does not speak to the party verbally but instead they take measure of each other and she gestures for them to come closer. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] does and she touches him and communicates telepathically with him. She tells him she is [[Zaiobe]] and she has lost love for the [[Kikonu|Oni]] who they learn is called [[Kikonu]]. [[Kikonu]] serves something called the [[Nindinzego|Ten-Handed One]]. [[Zaiobe]] and [[Kikonu]] used to date. She volunteers to aid us in killing [[Kikonu]]. She has lived in [[Brinewall Village|Brinewall]] for a long time. She tells that there is a[[Third Vault|Vault]] no one has been able to enter thus far. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] tries to communicate this all to his companions through a really terrible game of charades for what is far too long before [[Shoko]] makes him step aside to speed up the process. With [[Zaiobe]] in tow they all journey to the dungeon and clear a southern room containing [[Rotscale]] and two other [[Trogolodytes]] fighting for his amusement as well as a mostly scoured armory. After which they also discover strange spores in an antechamber off the kitchen to the west and after following that to it's source they find a slime creature[^4] they dispatch from range. Even deeper still they find a proper dungeon containing [[Slugwort]] and some prison cells. Having the jump on him and the aid of some Alchemist's fire via [[Shoko]] and [[Zaiobe]] he is quickly ended. Inside one of the cells [[Grayson]] finds one [[Kelda Oxgutter]]. [[Slugwort]] was threatening to eat her. She didn't trust us right away but after a little coaxing her story is revealed. She and her very late party were responsible for the mysterious end of the [[Sea Drake]] back in [[Brinewall Village]]. She was weak after the ordeal and was captured by the [[Corby]]s and Co and brought into [[Brinewall keep]]. She offered aid and also mentioned that she needs to return home at some point and if we help her back to her home of [[Kalsgard]] her family will reward us. Attempting to continue deeper the caravaneers are confroned with a series of what seem impossibly well locked doors into a cave-like chamber we unlock one of the second locks after jamming the first one and get stopped by the third. Returning and trying another route they spot [[Nindinzego]] and [[Kikonu]] in the cavernous room off the dungeon and attempt to sneak up on them. There is a large drop in the path and in crossing it [[Shoko]] stumbles climbing down and the noise of [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]]'s casting of feather fall alerts the enemies ending their ploy for surprise. Long and grueling fight ensues. There's flying. [[Zaiobe]] and [[Grayson]] carry us. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] spends the entire time keeping [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] alive. [[Kikonu]] is pretty much out of spells at this point and employs [[Dancing Wasp]] while [[Nindinzego]] flies high above casting down with a wand and nastier things. The party prevails.

# The Legacy and The Seal
[[Zaiobe]] makes it clear that she currently means no harm to the party but considers [[Brinewall keep]] to be her home and with no further common goal gives them 24 hours to conclude their business there before she will consider them tresspassers and slay them. The party thanks her and goes about just that.
After confirming the death of [[Nindinzego]] and [[Kikonu]] the party climbs up the two sheer drop offs constituting the way from the other dungeon related entrance. Faced with an Iron gate with a woman on it and funerary alcoves branching from the way in perpendicular fashion. Part of the room is collapsed and contains flowing motes of light. Knowledge these Alcoves contain the previous commanders of [[Brinewall Village|Brinewall]]
Still not having found anything they believe will help [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] they make sure they have searched the entire cavern system and dungeon under [[Brinewall keep]]. They discover a secret sea cliff walk path that leads straight into the chamber that housed [[Nindinzego]]. 
Making their way back up to make sure they have cleared the ground floor they encounter [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe Icemark]], a short [[Varki]] woman with two shortswords at her sides, poking the dead bodies of the [[Trogolodytes]] the party had killed in the 'throne room'. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] Accompanies us after hearing our business because she loves a mystery. 
Proceeding to the back of the throne room they encounter the only door they had not yet explored due to chasing after [[Kikonu]] earlier. Using a skeleton key they aquired at some point they find It contains a hallway leading to stairs both down and up. As they enter soldiers of blood coagulate into being and instead of attacking thank the adventurers for the death of [[Kikonu]]. One of the next rooms greets them with a decrepit body opening the door which approaches [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and [[Grayson]] and attacks. After dispatching the [[Andril Kortun|Wight]] they enter the room he came from and find it to be an officers quarters in disarray as if raided or attacked. On the desk they find letters addressed to and from [[Andril Kortun]] the commander of [[Brinewall keep]]. The last of the letters is hastily scribbled and describing the attack on the keep by Ninja and [[Oni]].
The party returns the way it came and then takes the stairs leading downward. There are empty raided vaults here. An Ominous shadowy [[Tian]] man confronts them. 

>"I know this name"

he says and screams in anguish. Weeping he begs them to 
>"Take the [[Amatatsu Seal|seal]] away from here. Take it to my child." 

and disappears. 

Behind him is a Hidden door through which the party find 3 darkwood chests the left and right of which are locked. Opening the middle chest they find a complex and beautiful red and gold filigreed [[Warding Box|Box]] radiating magic. it is a [[Warding Box]]. Once opened it blinds [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] temporarily and the party detects something even more powerful inside. The source is a [[Amatatsu Seal|Stone Statuette of a Dragon]]. Upon beholding it a vision overtakes the group.

### *Visions of Jade* 
[^5]
>__*An [[Oni]] army with burning skin, glaring eyes, and sharp tusks, wearing strange armor and wielding exotic weaponsâemerge in a storm from a vast forest, then descend upon [[Minkai]]. This vision is swiftly followed by another: [[Higashiyama Shigure]] dressed in royal robes stands over a simple well, a friend at his side. Suddenly, the friend grows nearly three times in size and is sheathed in a frightening suit of jade armor. The [[Jade Regent|Jade Warrior]] draws a sword and strikes down his royal friend, then holds the bloody sword aloft in triumph. A third vision follows, this time of [[Tsutoku Amatatsu|Tsutoku]] (now known to be the true name of [[Tsutoku Amatatsu|Rokuro Kaijitsu]] handing the legendary sentient sword [[Te No Sui]] to a richly dressed [[Fynn Snaevald|Ulfen Man]] man, [[Fynn Snaevald]], in exchange for a bag of gold to fund his families flight. Finally, this vision fades, and we see [[Ameiko Amatatsu]] waking from  her [[Ameiko's Possession|Possession]] as the [[Kami]] inhabiting her flys back into the [[Amatatsu Seal|Seal]], but she is dressed in the finery of an empress. She rises from sleep not in [[Caravan|The Caravan]], but from a resting spot within the arms of a [[jade throne]].*__

[^5]: [[Visions of Jade]]

These visions pass in the span of a few heartbeats, and after they do, the [[Amatatsu Scions]] are left with the knowledge that they are just that, That [[Te No Sui]] may have even more knowledge of the [[The Amatatsu|Amatatsu]]'s legacy, That [[Ameiko Amatatsu]] is the heir to the [[The Amatatsu|Amatatsu]] royal family and rightful heir of the [[Jade Throne]] of [[Minkai]], and that the [[Warding Box]] has protected the [[Amatatsu Seal]] from detection by the [[Oni of the Five Storms]] for this long and having the opened it they have revealed themselves to great danger.
With this knowledge the party opens the other chests finding more treasures that appear tailored to their strengths and quickly gather up those items and the [[Warding Box]] to make haste back to [[Caravan|The Caravan]] and [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]]. They discover quite quickly that she is waiting for them back in the throne room. She confirms she also shared in the vision. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] swears himself to her service and in gratitude and her newfound right grants him the title of [[Samurai]]. [[Shoko]] warns her that she can throw the [[Warding Box]] into the sea and forget it all. [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] says she cannot stand by and allow the suffering under the [[Jade Regent]]. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] asks what she will do. She believes her responsibility to the [[Minkai]]an people too great in spite of no wish to rule.
With all of these thoughts weighing on the party they make their way back to [[Caravan|The Caravan]] where they determine they will head north to [[Kalsgard]] to inquire after [[Te No Sui|the sword]] and the way further north to [[The Crown of the World]] and the northern passage[^1] to [[Minkai]]. After that is determined they ask more of [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]'s reasons for being at [[Brinewall keep]]. She says she is from very far north. Went south for '[[Kireama Icemark|Mother]]'s interest in chronicalling knowledge'. [[Kireama Icemark|Mother]] sent her to 'learn about her own culture.' With all the sharing going around and various bits of [[Minkai]]an spoken [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] notices [[Shoko]] speaks the tongue as well and asks how he came to be in [[Varisia]] being from [[Minkai]] himself. [[Shoko]] says he 'came here a long time ago after altercation back in [[Minkai]] and was saved by [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] when in trouble here.' All the while [[Grayson]] shares hot food and strong drink with [[Kelda Oxgutter]] once again keeping up the groups hospitality. With that the party retires and rests with a long journey ahead of them.

# [[Fynn Snaevald|The Merchant]] and The Raid

Those on watch hear the scrape of wood on sandy gravel as a longship beaches on the shores near [[Caravan|The Caravan]]. Having been detected the [[Ulfen]] Raider's let loose cries and set upon the camp. The [[Amatatsu Scions|Scions]] rouse and arm themselves to take up the defense as well as [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]], [[Sandru Vhiski|Sandru]], [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]], and [[Kelda Oxgutter|Kelda]]. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] rushes to aid [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] in her caravan after seeing several raiders enter as he does he spies a large peculiar [[Wodes|Raven]] with a red feather on it's breast which flies off into the night when spotted. The fight ends with the capture of one of the [[Ulfen Raiders]]. The party determines to interrogate him. When he is less than forthcoming [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] threatens to tie stones to the mans feet and send him into the river he came from. The man begins bleeding from his eyes and ears and quickly dies. Confused the party see if the man lives and search his body. They discover a symbol branded on his chest and identify it as a [[Blood Geas]], A mark left by the weapon [[Oathtaker]] a Tetsubo. After discussing they also determine that the longship bearing their attackers is the [[Arl's Hammer]] belonging to [[Asvig Longthews]]. Some in the party share that he is the husband of [[Helva]] who is the real power between the two and a powerful witch. Pondering the thought of a powerful necromancer against them and the mysterious [[Wodes|Raven]] as well as the social and politcal implications of this attack they make a plan to split their forces to enter [[Kalsgard]] in a way to be both less and more conspicuous to draw danger away from [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]].
Come morning with their plan in action they draw near to the city aboard the [[Arl's Hammer]] when a strange golden [[Wei Yan|Flying Monkey]] lands upon the bow of the boat. Calmly smoking a pipe, He is unresponsive to their questions or actions at first. Soon however the [[Xiao]] communicates to them that he is named [[Wei Yan]] and that he is an emissary of [[Shizuru]] come to watch over [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]]. With this new addition they seek out a place to stay and gather information. Over a mix of [[Tian]] and [[Ulfen]] food and drink they as the tavern keep if there is anyone who could guide them north. They are recommended [[Ulf Gormundr]] or his apprentice [[Uksahkka]]. They also inquire about [[Fynn Snaevald]] and where he can be found. They determine to speak to [[Fynn Snaevald|Fynn]] first and set out for his house.
Before reaching their destination the come to a bridge with two statues on the siderails. Upon crossing the statues come to life and attack them. They dispatch them fairly easily. Afterwards they find the traces of the sigils that constituted a trap that must have been laid for them.
Continuing on to the ex-trader's house they are greeted by his house servant and welcomed in. They introduce themselves and their reason for visiting. [[Fynn Snaevald|Fynn]] tells them he no longer has [[Te No Sui]]. He kept it all this time and had always planned to return it to [[Tsutoku Amatatsu|Rokuro]] but he never returned. He had housed and fed [[Tsutoku Amatatsu|Rokuro]] during his families flight and wished them well. About two weeks past thugs in all black dress broke in and stole it leaving only a black [[Wodes]] feather behind. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] thinks these are the signs of the [[Frozen Shadows]]. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] shows [[Fynn Snaevald|Fynn]] the swords he got from the secret [[Third Vault]], [[Fynn Snaevald|Fynn]] admires them and thanks him. At this time a page arrives bearing a scroll for [[Fynn Snaevald|Fynn]]. It contains a declaration of a blood feud between [[Fynn Snaevald|Fynn]] and [[Asvig Longthews]] over unpaid wereguilt. At this point the party decides they need to pay [[Asvig Longthews|Asvig]] a visit.
Sharing all knowledge they have or have gathered on him they focus on the news that they are feasting in celebration of a funeral. [[Snorri Stone-eye]] the mad reaver has just passed. He was a very powerful raider who plundered the [[Sotlands]] to the south financed by the [[Rimerunners]]. He fell ill on a recent journey and died very quickly. His assets were sold back to the [[Rimerunners]] before he was even fully dead.
They arrive at the [[Asvig Longthews|Asvig]]'s hall and opt for stealth and reconaissance. Listening at different points of entry and examining the area they determine there are a large number of [[Ulfen]] raiders present and return to town to gather more fighters from [[Caravan|The Caravan]]. Returning in greater force [[Caravan|The Caravan]]eers debate points of entry and whether or not to burn their enemies out finally deciding on storming the rear entrance in force. Making their way in they dispatch a few who are harrassing the kitchen help whom they detain and question. Not finding much information they continue into the long hall where they come upon the scene of [[Helva]] bedding raiders in celebration with many drunken others passed out about the place. [[Asvig Longthews|Asvig]] and those coherent charge and the [[Helva|Witch]] starts working magics. Beating down the sober, slaying [[Asvig Longthews|Asvig]], and holding [[Helva]] at swordpoint they question her. 


---
# The Witch and The Teacher

She tells them that they stole [[Te No Sui|the sword]] and an older/middle aged [[Tian]] woman who walked like a figher paid them well for it. They hid [[Te No Sui|the sword]] in a place no one will ever find it again. inferring the worst the [[Amatatsu Scions|Scions]] believe they have put [[Te No Sui|the sword]] aboard [[Snorri's Funeral Ship]]. the [[Amatatsu Scions|Scions]] press [[Helva]] further and she relays that they did not kill [[Snorri Stone-eye]] nor were they the ones who left a feather after stealing [[Te No Sui]]. [[Helva]] having shared this information attempts to kill [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] and [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] intervenes preventing a one on one fight. As [[Helva]] passes strange and ominous flames forming a death's head rise from her corpse in the mark of [[Urgathoa]]. The remaing living raiders are offered work with [[Caravan|The Caravan]] and head back to join up. Determined to find [[Snorri's Funeral Ship]] the party quickly heads south and find [[Uksahkka]], [[Ulf Gormundr]]'s apprentice, asking us to find him and if we can to bring him to [[Yin Po]] at the shrine of [[Shelyn]] in the [[Fire Quarter]]. [[Uksahkka]] tells the party the location of [[spear shatter harbor]]. After finding the location of the ship and with the notion that the missing [[Ulf Gormundr]] may be aboard along with [[Te No Sui|the sword]] they make haste. As they approach those with knowledge of the procedure of these cultural funeral ships share it. Taking three small boats out to ferry they party they close on the [[funeral ship]] but are interrupted by a [[giant crab]] intent on feasting on them. They dispatch it and board.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] quickly disables the time released fire starting method. They pass up the body on the pyre and head below decks finding it piled high with treasures but hearing the sounds of movement and chains rattling in the dark. Chained on a long lead is the dead [[Snorri Stone-eye]] who is now a [[draugr]]. As they discover this there is a commotion above decks and peering back up they find [[Wei Yan]] unconscious and [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] missing and several figures garbed in black poised to attack as lightning unexpectedly strikes the ship setting it ablaze. Most of the party scrambles to get back above decks to recover [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] and [[Grayson]] fells the unliving [[Snorri Stone-eye|Snorri]] below and quickly searches for [[Te No Sui]] and [[Ulf Gormundr|Ulf]]. Those above dispatch the [[Frozen Shadows]] assaulting them and [[Grayson]] find neither objects of his search but instead finds a [[Zio|Mage]] bound and gagged and a strange [[Helgarval|Talking Helmet]]. Releasing him and making haste back up and off the ship the fire is staunched and they turn to questioning the one ninja they had not killed who quickly chooses death by leaping into the deep over betrayal.
Finding [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] nowhere in sight and none of what they came for the [[Scions]] regroup sailing back to shor. Introducing himself [[Helgarval]] shares that he is was a familiar to a wizard who died and is now stranded on the material plane. He has spent a great deal of time following the movements of the [[Frozen Shadows]] since. On the way back to [[Kalsgard]] they discuss the [[Frozen Shadows]] hunting them and their knowledge of the group with [[Helgarval]] sharing that they have been using the [[Rimerunners]] as a front for the last few years.
With few leads the [[Scions]] make way to the [[Kalsgard Shelyn Temple]] which they find crumbling and burning on their approach with screams coming from inside. Entering they see an Earth elemental standing over the body of an injured priest and hear

> "Leave [[Yin Po|the priest]], Kill them."

screeched from somwhere in the dark. 

The party engages the earthen behemoth while the voice from the dark urges it to kill them. During the fight it is identified as the [[Wodes|Red Feather Raven]] that has been ahead of them at every turn. [[Grayson]] gifts several arrows to it before it flees as the group reduces the earth elemental to dust.
[[Shoko]] asks [[Yin Po|the priest]] what happened and he says it was basically all a blur. 
The [[Wodes|Raven]] appeared and suddenly the earth elemental was there and destroying the place. He doesn't think it was a normal [[Wodes|raven]]. [[Grayson]] agrees pointing out that he put two arrows into it and it didn't even slow it down. We make sure that priest is alright and then show him the token [[Uksahkka]] told us to present to him. 
[[Yin Po]] says 

>"I see. Of course. Come with me" >

and shows them to the safehouse in the garden shed. On the way [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] expresses they've been looking for [[Ulf Gormundr|Ulf]] but have been unable to locate him. Arriving [[Yin Po]] shows them a secret door inside the shed revealing the [[Shelyn Temple Safehouse]]. The door is currently destroyed. The party notices a large black feather on the floor they believe could only come from a [[Tengu]] as well as a dart from a blowgun. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] examines it and determines it is dosed with blue winnis poison she describes it as standard protocol for the [[Frozen Shadows]] any targets they don't want to kill and draw suspicion to lower profile targets they'll dose with this and this is likely what knocked out [[Wei Yan]] on the [[Funeral Ship]]. Further searching the cellar they find no other trace of [[Uksahkka]]. Discussing the state of their mission they lament the fact that their enemies now hold [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] as well as both of their possible guides for the northern passage. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] points out that Blue Winnis is very hard to cultivate and should make very easy ties to their foes once they can locate a source. Left with only the [[Rimerunners]] guild as a possible lead they determine they desperately need to investigate.

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] shares that it is located in the [[Jade Quarter]]. [[Helgarval]] adds that they have been extremely active recently. The party heads toward the [[Ivory Quarter]] to find accomodation and further plan their reconnaisance. Upon approach [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] is nearly killed in an ambush from an [[Ulfen]] archer on the tavern balcony. Closing quickly and chasing her down when she flees [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] corner [[Hekja|The assassin]] in the alley and intimidate her into surrendering. Finding no amount of pay worth her life she begins sharing what she knows. She was hired by [[Jorgun the Axe]] a [[Werebear]] to kill at least one of the [[Caravan|The Caravan]] to reduce our number. After accepting the contract [[Hekja]] tailed him, a good habit in her profession, as he traveled north away from the city. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] infers from this that the only suitable location to the north that the [[Frozen Shadows]] could be operating out of is [[Ravenscraeg]], a naturally and artificially fortified fortress that belonged to [[Snorri Stone-eye]] north of [[Kalsgard]]. Before she can share much more information however a hand sprouts from [[Hekja]]'s throat spraying gore out just as [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] were offering her freedom.

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Thats about what i was expecting"</mark> -[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]
><mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">"You dissapoint me student"</mark> -[[Omoyani|Ninja]]
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Sensei"</mark> -[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]

The party confused at first in the clash ask if this is someone they shouldn't be killing and [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] assures them that they want her dead. The woman is able to appear and disappear at will making for a very difficult fight which ends with the [[Scions]] still breathing and a retreating foe as well as dead assassin and a poisoned shuriken buried in the alley wall. The [[Omoyani|Ninja]] runs up the side of the building and disappears across the rooftops as [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] gives chase up the side of the building losing sight of her. The caravaneers take stock of the throwing star left behind as well as the orginal assassins horse. Understandably having many questions for her [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] urges the party not to do so in the open so they head inside the inn for some privacy. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] informs them of her history with the [[Frozen Shadows]] a la her parentage and her tutelage under [[Omoyani]], the one who addressed her as student a short time ago. She also tells them the mastermind behind this particular band of assassins is [[Kimandatsu]] who reports to the [[Oni of the Five Storms]]. With their foe's strength becoming clearer they also discuss [[Ravenscraeg]]. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] notes it is a likely locale for them as most in the area only travel north to take the northern passage, The [[Path of Agenhai]]. She also reveals her true name to be [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki]], that her father is the head of some even more serious and sinister operation he was called away from the [[Frozen Shadows]] for, and that her mother [[Kireama Icemark|Kireama]] took her away. [[Kireama Icemark|Kireama]] was the reason she was at [[Brinewall Village|Brinewall]], sent to gain an understanding of her own family history or legacy. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] decided then not to kill us and thus damned herself to be an enemy of her former organization. She shares some more nitty gritty on the [[Frozen Shadows]] combat abilities such as most of their number cannot perform ninjutsu like she or [[Omoyani]], and that the [[Wodes|Red Feather Raven]] is somehow associated and working on their behalf or at least for mutual benefit. She assures the group that the [[Rimerunners]] guild office will hold more information for them.

# The Guild and The [[Frozen Shadows]]

Having learned all that the party determines they need rest before they act and that they will take watches and recuperate at an inn in the [[Ivory Quarter]] while [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] does some reconaissance on the [[Rimerunners]]. In the morning the party does some shopping on the way to prepare for some of the tricks that they've seen from the [[Frozen Shadows]] so far.
While this is going [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] is carefully watching the [[Rimerunners]] building noting the points of egress and the guards number and shift changes. Only one windows is boarded up and barred. With careful prodding she finds an easy way in and finds herself in an empty office. FInding nothing of interest she continues on to more rooms peering through a keyhole she passes on a room with two lounging guards for a different locked one and picks the lock. It appears to be a storage closet at first but after careful searching she finds a secret door behind a panel. Inside she finds a trapdoor in the floor to another storage location, this one containing a heavy iron lockbox against the north wall. After bypassing the lock on that as well she finds it contains two thousand gold pieces as well as some very importnat looking ledgers and paperwork. Gathering these pilfered treasures up and peering through another portal she decides she's risked enough on her own and makes a mental note of the secret rooms location and carefully covers her tracks and makes her exit. Returning to the others flipping some of her spoils she, [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]], and [[Shoko]] gather everyone to go over [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]'s findings.
The [[Stolen Documents]] confirm that the [[Arl's Hammer]] was rented to [[Asvig Longthews]] on the night of the attack at [[Skalsbridge]] and also that he was contracted by the [[Rimerunners]] to aquire a [[Tian]] artifact from a specific address recognizable as [[Fynn Snaevald]]'s home. They also detail financial transactions of large sums over the last few years to [[Ravenscraeg]] including the artifact which is likely [[Te no Sui]]. All of these orders were approved by someone called [[Kimandatsu|Thorborg Silverskorr]] who is apparently the owner of the [[Rimerunners]]. Also included is the purchase of [[Ravenscraeg]] from [[Snorri Stone-eye|Snorri]] several years ago.
While the group is pondering these revelations and confirmations [[Shoko]] raises the idea of using some of this information as a bargaining chip, taking these damning documents and meeting with the [[Rimerunners]] and using them to barter to get [[Uksahkka]] back, assuming that if they don't outright have her there then they'll know her location and we can liberate her without any bloodshed. The others are amenable to this idea.
As they approach the [[Rimerunners]] guild office [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] Hangs back to watch for any deceit from the guild from a rooftop across the street. The rest of the group walks straight in not being stopped by the guard outside and after some strong words to the clerk from [[Shoko]] in spite of a failed 'appointment' ruse [[Kimandatsu|Silverskorr]] agrees to see them.
[[Kimandatsu|Thorborg Silverskorr]] is right through the office door and is apparently a beautiful [[Ulfen]] woman. She asks after the mysterious item we've brought her and [[Shoko]] goes into the notion of our exchange, [[Uksahkka]] for the [[Stolen Documents]]. [[Kimandatsu|Silverskorr]] plays dumb at first but when we mention the [[Shelyn Temple Safehouse]] and the probablilty of [[Uksahkka]] being brought here she says we might be correct. At this point [[Grayson]] passes the [[Stolen Documents]] forward and flashes them to her and repeats the terms of the exchange. 

>"So you're offering the documents that [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] -excuse me- [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Hatsuyuki]] (spoken in perfect Tien) stole in the night?" - [[Kimandatsu|Thorborg Silverskorr]]

Meanwhile [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] is across the street watching this conversation through the barred window to the office. [[Shoko]] feigns ignorance and calls out the womans feigned ignorance of the whereabouts of [[Ulf Gormundr|The Guide]]'s apprentice.

><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"We could both leave here with what we want"</mark> -[[Shoko]]
><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"We could.... but.... what makes you think you're going to be leaving here alive"</mark> - [[Kimandatsu|Thorborg Silverskorr]]

she emphasizes that we're in a building full of her guards.
The group attempts to diffuse with diplomacy while [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Hatsuyuki]] notices a rusted iron-bound massive club under the office desk. As [[Shoko]]'s speech ends [[Kimandatsu|Silverskorr]]'s appearance ripples and changes as she transforms.

As the battle begins [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] turns to [[Shoko]] and says

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"I'm so sorry you were right."</mark>

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] is able to immediately identify [[Kimandatsu|Silverskorr]]'s new appearance as an [[Oni]] and an [[Ogre]] at that. The party including [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] battles it out against the [[Ogre]], [[Omoyani]], and the [[Rimerunners]] guards. [[Grayson]] firing arrows left and right, [[Zio]] nearly freezing [[Omoyani]] in one shot right away. As [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] closes in having recognized the danger she also recognizes the transformed [[Kimandatsu|Silverskorr]] as [[Kimandatsu]] and says 

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Hi boss"</mark> 

and [[Kimandatsu]] grins back at her. Still smiling she attempts to obliterate [[Shoko]] who was left in the office alone with her but he skillfully dodges and deflects all her deadly blows. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] having challenged [[Kimandatsu]] but not wanting to engage in such close quarters yells for [[Shoko]] to retreat out of the room just as [[Zio]] is nearly cleaved in half by a guard's greatsword attack. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] having closed into the room in the fray and spotting her sensei [[Omoyani]] says 

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">''Where are you master."</mark>

and crushes a charm in her fist and spots her magically undetected behind a very wounded [[Zio]]. [[Zio]] having planned ahead for this appears to explode into glitter revealing [[Omoyani]]'s position and retreating to safety outside magically. [[Omoyani]] Recognizes she's been had and beings making several hand signs appearing to split in two which is just in time as [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] appears and takes several swings at her, evaporating her newly made twin. [[Omoyani]] greets her with a 

><mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">"Hello student"</mark> 

proving she can see [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] just as well as [[Omoyani]] can see her. Just when the odds are beginning to favor the [[Amatatsu Scions|Scions]] however [[Kimandatsu]] finally connects with [[Shoko]] powerfully on the backswing of another miss and he falls unconscious to the ground. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] sees this and tries to make his way to [[Shoko]] and fells another guard. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] attempts to return [[Omoyani]]'s poisoned shuriken from the encounter in the alley but she catches it in midair. [[Grayson]] sinks some more arrows into [[Omoyani]] before she can escape as [[Kimandatsu|Silverskorr]] shifts back into her smaller human form and tries to do the same.
[[Shoko]] having been revived by [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] is able to stand but not fast enough to chase down the retreating shapeshifter. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] hesitates temporarily over the multiple people bleeding out on the office floor but ultimately gives chase and strikes her another time with his blade and says 

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> "Where are you going? We're not done"</mark>
   <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"We are done for now."</mark> 

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] catches up as well in a graceful flash. [[Kimandatsu]] smiles at her seeming to be enjoying this. 

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Come on now, you haven't been put through the wrenches since what, last time my old man was around here? you'll be fine"</mark>-[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"It has been some time since i fought opponents who were worthy"</mark> -[[Kimandatsu]]
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"But you're still losing"</mark> -N 
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"Am i losing?"</mark> -K

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] brandishes her [[Oni]] bane wakizashi at [[Kimandatsu]] who promises all her new friends will die if she uses that on her as he hand coaleseces with ice. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] ponders for a long moment before sheathing the weapon and stepping aside. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] does not attempt to stop her either.

><mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">"Good Choice"</mark> -[[Kimandatsu]]

She takes literal flight and departs. The [[Wodes|Raven]] accompanies her from the railing
[[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] magically heals [[Shoko]]'s wounds and [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] starts checking on those not standing back in the front office primarily [[Omoyani]] as he begins to attempt to save her [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] approaches and stomps on her neck extinquishing her former masters life.

# The Eve and The Warning

Frowning Deeply

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Oh, Dear"</mark> - N
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Do you think the guards know anything?"</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I'm going to take it on faith that they didnt even know that their boss was, well, my boss."</mark> - N 

Waving her hand nonchalantly.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"I wanted to find out if Ameiko is still alive"</mark> - O 

Frowning still.

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Maybe she could have said something to you but frankly I don't know how much of it would have been useful unless you have ways of detecting people who can lie."</mark> - N 

as she pulls [[Omoyani]]'s clothes back to reveal a lack of a [[blood geas]].

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Is Everyone okay? Shoko you took quite a beating how are you feeling"</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"Augh, Like i just spent a night in the single worst bar in--- where are we again?, About that bad" </mark>- S
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Well you're still alive so if i may offer a personal insight i'd say you haven't been to the worst bar in Kalsguard Also, you took Oathtaker directly to the face and survived. So I am genuinely impressed"</mark> - N

[^7]

[^7]:  [[Oathtaker]]

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] passes [[Shoko]] a few potions of cure light.

The party then does inventory of the room and bodies finding on [[Omoyani]] Deathblade and Black Lotus extract, her dagger [[Deadly Kiss]], 4 shuriken they are sure are magical, a blowgun and darts, masterwork thieves tools, and her also Magical [[Shozoku]]. On the others they find fairly expected weapons and armor and not much else. 

Hearing the commotion downstairs but having been too slow to react several more guards from upstairs make their way the the ground floor and upon seeing what they find to be no longer their business quickly and politely depart. 

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] turns toward the others as this occurs
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Do we want to hire them?"</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Do you really want someone who's going to run away at the first sign of a massive violence" </mark>- N
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"That's fair. But we do have a habit of picking up people who used to work for those that we just fought and bringing them with us right Noe?"</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"What?"</mark> - S Simultaneously <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I Know it terrifies me"</mark> - N
><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"We did that once i wouldn't call that a habit"</mark> - S
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"No, we have the Raiders and we have Noe"</mark> - O Smiling

She puts up a single finger. 
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"To be fair, though You didn't exactly know that until fairly recently and you haven't kicked me out yet. So, I can only assume that you're either putting up with me or plotting to have me thrown in the river by the end of the evening, but I'm hoping for the first one."</mark> - N
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Your insider knowledge has been absolutely invaluable. Noe. That's is all I am saying"</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"It has to be. If I don't tell you, I'm gonna die with it."</mark> - N
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well, we have no one to ask any questions of and I think we know where we're headed."</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Not unless you know how to talk to the dead. I'm afraid."</mark> - N
><mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"Are we certain that Ushaka's not here."</mark> - G
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"That is an excellent point Grayson perhaps we should take a better look around."</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"Lets search the building."</mark> - S 

They find a clerk who is still in the building who shares Ukshakas location with them being the room with the boarded up windows. Inside they find her bound and gagged.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"We've been looking everywhere for you."</mark> - O.

She mumbles in response. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] frees her. 

>"You have my thanks for freeing me." - [[Uksahkka]]
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"No, thanks necessary. We desperately need your help."</mark> - O
>"Have you found any news of [[Ulf Gormundr|Ulf]]?" - [[Uksahkka]]
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"We found zero new of him and we've looked quite a few places, dangerous ones at that. Are you well, Did they harm you?"</mark> - O
>"Not beyond the beating they gave me to steal me... with many strange large bird men." - U
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Strange how?"</mark> - O
>"Well to be fair. They all looked like you, but they were all wearing these black pajamas." - U
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Please don't call them pajamas."</mark> - N
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Those are in fashion lately."</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"I need to get some of those too"</mark> - S
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Do you know how many years you need to study before you actually earn a Shozoku?"</mark> - N

[[Shoko]] just stares knowingly.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well Ukshaka I'm not sure how much you know but from things we found here, and various other interactions with our pajama friends, We believe that they're holding our friend and Ulf at Ravenscrag."</mark> -O

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"You would take us there? We could use your help"</mark> - O
>"If they have captured [[Ulf Gormundr|Ulf]] Of course." - U
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well then I think it settled. I think we should make our way there. Maybe we could do some reconnaissance again. These are very very dangerous enemies we are facing"</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"How, how long is the trip there?"</mark> - G
>"Two days walk south of [[Places/Golarion/Inner Sea/Saga Lands/Land of the Linnorm Kings/Kalsgard/Kalsgard|Kalsgard]] toward those grey hills there. One by horse. The way is boggy with shale hillocks. I will take you there and fight with you, for [[Ulf Gormundr|Ulf]]." - U

The party plans and shops.

During this time [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] attempts to get graysons blood to use as a basis for antitoxins against the poisons we've seen the [[Frozen Shadows]] use so far but he refuses
Later [[Shoko]] pulls [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] aside

><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"Um when we're doing this, when we're assaulting your former clan, are you sure? We might have to kill everyone in there."</mark> - S
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Oh, I'm very much counting on that you do."</mark> - N
><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"There's nobody want us to try and set aside. No one. You want us to try and spare?"</mark> - S

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] stops, takes off her glasses and ponders the question while cleaning them putting them back on
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I want you to kill them so thoroughly that Pharasma will not recognize their souls when they go for judgment. They're that kind of people. So, no, I don't want you to save anyone. Except the lady Ameiko of course that's kind of the whole point of this But the rest? they know what they signed up for"</mark> - N

[[Shoko]] nods.
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I appreciate that you ask though really."</mark> - N
><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"It's hard thing when we're about to do, but we must"</mark> - S

Reaching a defensible clearing the party decides they should rest to be better prepared for the dangers to come but not before an ocre jelly emerges from under the bridge they camp near and attacks them. [[Shoko]] recognizes the creature and relays to the party 
that cutting or stabbing the creature has little effect except to cause it to split into copies of itself creating more enemies.

## Jelly Assault
1.	
[[Zio]] attacks with sonic blast which seems effective
[[Shoko]] creates illusionary copies of himself and charges it.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] fires an arrow out of his sleeve which causes the ooze to duplicate.
[[Uksahkka]] charges it.
[[Grayson]] flying kicks his way in and decimates one of the oozes
ooze attacks [[shoko]] dispelling an image
2. 
[[Zio]] fires a blast of heat from his hands on the remaining ooze
[[Shoko]] adopts a defensive stance.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] closes the gap and strikes it with his staff.
##
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] wipes his weapon clean in the grass.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Nice Kick Grayson"</mark> - O 

Elbowing Noe 
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"What did i tell you look at those kicks"</mark>
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Fucking terrifying, Grayson remind me again, Where did you learn how to do that?"</mark> -N
><mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"No need to remind you. I never told you in the first place"</mark> - G
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Yeah, that was kind of the hint. I was gonna be, you know, like decent about it. But seriously, What school are you from?"</mark> - N
><mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"I learned it in my clan hold and then a lot of practicing with Shelalu"</mark> - G
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Interesting don't believe i've ever heard of Dwarven-based martial arts but it makes sense, you know? I just expected. It would be more..." </mark>

She makes a motion arounds graysons outline and then almost picks it up and throws it.
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I was expecting more of that from dwarven martial arts"</mark> - N

While this conversation was happening [[Shoko]] strokes his chin over the remains of the defeated jelly.
><mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">"I think I think that might have been a surprise left for us by the shadows. In which case, if this is their idea of a trap, then I don't think we have much to worry about from their trappings of the castle" </mark>- S

[[Uksahkka]] had made herself busy through this conversation as well readying a place for a fire and with help from [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] who had began gathering wood.

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] queiting surveyed the area noticing very large bird footprints alongside human prints.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] sees her staring once the fire is started and also gazes upon them ponderously 

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"That is a good number of them. We should definitely set watches tonight. I don't want to get any closer until we've had some rest."</mark>

[[Shoko]] takes notice and mutters some words under his breath and waving his hands lets out a bird call loud and clear.
As he does this hundreds and hundreds of ravens swirl towards them from out of the surrounding trees landing nearby. 
As they come to rest. One answers [[shoko]].

><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"Yes, You are being hunted."</mark>
><mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"You would be hunted now if our master knew you called us.</mark> *they know they know they know they know*"
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Your cousins are weird Ochi."</mark> - N
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"So are yours."</mark> - O

The party determines a watch order and sets to bed.

In the night on [[Grayson]]s watch he notices bird footprints appear in the snow one by one and hears a twig snap on the other side of camp.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] also notices footprints in another location.

## Ambush
---
1. 
[[Grayson]] reaches down and picks up a handful of snow and flings it at one of the sets of foot prints shouting "Ambush!" and follows the snowball with an arrow.  As the rest of the party begins waking from his call [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] dodges a stab from an invisible attacker whos illusion melts away into the visage of a somehow blurry [[Tengu]] ninja.
[[Shoko]] who was still sleeping is woken as another assailant sinks their blade into him.
The first one to alert [[Grayson]] closes on him but misses his strike. 
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] tries to grab the assassin closest to him so he can't lose track of him and fails.
Another bird ninja scores a vicious blow against [[zio]] before he can react.
2. 
[[Grayson]] fills the closest enemy with several arrows felling him.
[[Shoko]] counters his assailant but misses holding his deadly spell in his hand.
[[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] taps [[Zio]] with her want reviving him somewhat.
[[Uksahkka]] gets to her feet and readies her weapon.
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] being roused as well readies her weapons and steps into the darkness vanishing from sight.
The [[Tengu]] closest to her steps away from the place [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] melted into the darkness and pulls out a blowgun.
The [[Tengu]] who had already buried his wakizashi in [[Shoko]] once continues trying to eviscerate [[shoko]] and scores another devastating attack on him.
[[Zio]] gains his feet only to be struck by the shadow nearest him. [[Zio]] responds by drawing his mace and striking back.
[[Wei yan]] cannot connect with a [[Tengu]] he tries to attack.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] abandons his plan to grapple the [[Tengu]] drawing his weapons and slashes the [[Tengu]].
The [[Tengu]] nearest [[zio]] stabs him twice and zios health is drained.
[[Helgarval]] tries to strike a ninja and misses.
3. 
[[Grayson]] fires another blazing fast volley at the bird engaged with [[zio]].
[[Shoko]] finally connects with his spell and stands up while his opponent is distracted by his magic.
[[Uksahkka]] swings her sword and strikes the [[Tengu]] again.
A sword appears out of the chest of one of the [[Tengu]] and [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] appears behind him pulling it free and letting it fall to the ground.
The rattled recipient of [[Shoko]]s spell tries to back up but in his unpreparedness is struck by Wei-Yan and barely missed by [[Shoko]].
[[Zio]] pulls a wand out firing magical missiles at the fleeing avian.
Wei-Yan gives chase and strikes him again.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] cirlces around and cuts off his retreat but fails to connect.
[[Grayson]] refrains from ending the fleeing ninja with an arrow seeing [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] attempting to knock him unconcious.
[[Shoko]] catches up to the fray and strikes the [[Tengu]] in the back of the head felling him.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] picks him up and carries him back to the fire to be questioned.
##
[[Zio]] is coughing during this. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] notices and checks the dart in the snow confirming it is poisoned and pulls a vial from her haori and doses [[Zio]] with it who seems to recover.
	
While the poison seems to have run it's course [[Zio]] seems worse for the wear. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] digs in her pack and pulls out a scroll and performs a divine ritual quickly beseeching [[Desna]] and restoring [[Zio]]s vigor.

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] says a prayer to Hei Feng over the deceased [[Tengu]] lying in the snow and he and [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] begin moving the bodies away from camp searching them in the process. After which [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] helps [[Shoko]] back to the [[Caravan]] to finish resting. Looking at the weapons they carried they realize just how much danger they were in. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] pockets the remaining doses. [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] takes a sip of vodka by the fire before shuffling off the administer to [[Shoko]].

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Just to avoid that happening so badly again"</mark> - N 

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] tosses him one of the charms she is wearing about her neck.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] recognizes it as the charm she crushed when they fought [[Omoyani]].
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] explains how it works and how to activate it to him.
He thanks her and the party beds down for the night.

```
Rest
```

# The Storming and The Craeg 

In the morning the caravaneers make their way the rest of the way to [[Ravenscraeg]]. They come upon the structure towering up on a cliff consisting of a large hall and tower silent except for the caw of the mass of ravens adorning the roofs, eaves and railings. The way up is a narrow wooden stairway winding up the cliff 90 feet in switchback fashion. In some places the stair is anchored directly into the rock face and others they are suspended upon supports and buttresses driven into the rock. Lichen and moss cover the stairs and rocks with pale vines roots and blooms of Nightshade, Willow herb, and Bog Tea sprouting from the occasional crevice in the stone.

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"We should be wary of traps"</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"I think this is one of the rare times i agree with Noe"</mark> - G
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well, there's nowhere to go but up. Do you want to look around? See if there's another way. I have a feeling this is gonna be our only method of egress."</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I can go and take a look from the top if you'd prefer and see if there's anything on the way down."</mark> - N
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Information would be good. There's not many ways to retreat here."</mark> - O
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Yeah don't get yourself too badly harmed."</mark> - N

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] takes a few steps forward and dissapears instantly from sight. They party cannot see her but she climbs straight up the cliff using her supernatural abilities and circumvents much of the stairway. She scouts the landing and sees a place where the rock creates a landing upon wich a small hollow is plastered over with what appears to be a huge wasps nest. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] makes a mental note of that.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"How's it looking up there?"</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"How much do you like wasps?"</mark> - N
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"They can be really tasty actually, Kind of Spicy"</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"... "</mark> - N

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] continues her survey of the area as she makes her way back down the stair looking for traps. Upon returning to the party she puts a hand on [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and [[Uksahkka]]'s Shoulders.

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"It's more or less fine with exception of teh creepy looking wasp nest that looks big enough for me to walk into."</mark> - N
" *Son of a bitch* " - [[Uksahkka]] in [[Varki]] whos hand is on her sword
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Sorry she just kind of does that"</mark> - O
"You should not do that when we hunt those of your kind." - [[Uksahkka]]
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"No, but you probably should have seen me coming"</mark> - N
"I do not have a way to see that which is unseen." [[Uksahkka]]
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Well lets march on shall we."</mark> - O

And they make their way up the stairs finding no traps on their way and arriving at the rock landing and the strange insectoid mass. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] steps closer to try to examine it while still tens of feet away but before he can infer anything a spider eater with a pincered face, pincered hands and a stinger emerges from the mass. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] recognizes the beast and relays to the party the dangers it poses including a poison that paralyzes unhale victims for weeks at a time and the reproductive method of implanting it's young inside those it paralyzes.

## The Watchdog

1. 
It lunges before anyone can react baring pincers and stinger scoring multiple hits on [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] who is unprepared. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] stealing himself against this onlaught and though he has clearly been stung by the creature he doesn't seem overly hurt.
[[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] attempted to strike it and missed.
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] does the same and strikes true flaying the creature then vanishes.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] having recuperated somewhat also attempts to stab him adopting a defensive stance and strikes true on the slightly weakened spider eater.
[[Grayson]] from the rear fires a flurry of arrows ending the spider eaters existence.
##
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"I don't feel great Koya. Could you help me?"</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Given the color of these that's coming out of your sting hole there might I suggest chugging these anti-toxins."</mark> - N 

*tinking as small bottles hit the wooden walkway they stand on*

After having seen the first of the defenses of Ravenscragg [[Grayson]] Focuses his inner energies for a moment and his skin darkens.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"We should be very careful. If this was the front guard, they these things can paralyze you. I don't know how I fought it off but these are very dangerous defensive measures."</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"I bet they don't get lots of solicitors."</mark> - G
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Thank you for healing me by the way Koya" </mark>- O
>"Of course darling. Thank you for never... being boring." - [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]]
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"See Koya gets it."</mark> - N

The adventurers make their way further up the walkway and come upon a wide porch surmounting the rickety conglomeration of stairs and landings below providing a panoramic view of the boggy plains that extend to the hazy horizon. The looming green-grey stone hall of the fortress blocks further progress. Inset arrow slits with heavy wooden shutters flank a bronze banded portal that leads within above three more arrow slits look out over the precipice. Upon this fortress porch more of the avian assassins await the rescuers.

## The Shadow's Defenses
1. 
[[Grayson]], more than prepared, sinks several arrows into the foremost frosty shadow who slumps to the planks. 

><mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"I don't think they are here to welcome us."</mark> - G

[[Wei yan]] quickly pounces along the railing to close on another.
[[Uksahkka]] draws her sword and shield and steps into the fray.
The feathered defenders step forward and vanish.
One of them appears and strikes at [[Uksahkka]] and connects but [[Uksahkka]] seems to have weathered the attack well.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] charges another screaming "Where is [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Lady Ameiko]]?!" and attempt to feint and strike making a pitiful show in his emotional state.
[[Helgarval]] spouts a gout of flame from his visor onto one of the [[Tengu]].
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] slashes at the [[Tengu]] nearest her and cuts it down and vanishes from sight again.
2. 
[[Grayson]] sends another volley felling the last of the feathered foes.
##

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] continues on rushed in his fervor to find [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] 
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Let's go!"</mark> - O

Rows of pillars support the 40-foot high roof of this long hall torches set into pillars sconces and two fire pits set with iron spits in the center of the rust strewn floor give the room a ruddy glow. Several doors open into rooms on either side beneath 10 foot high balconies lined with feasting tables. At the far end of the hall a 15-foot high balcony with the master's high table looks out over all. Smoke holes cut into the roof high above allow in more light, and the croaking of the many ravens that roost on the roofs ridge pole.

><mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">"That's a lot of options on where to go."</mark> - G
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Check em all."</mark> - N
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"We may as well start searching."</mark> - O

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] walks up to the first door on the right and looks back at [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] and turns back to the door and looks it over for signs of traps. He sees nothing suspicious and opens it. Inside he finds a guard room empty save for rocks and piles of broken rubble. 

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Nothing in here."</mark> - O

[[Grayson]] opens the opposing door across the hall and sees a very similar guard room in a similar state.
The party continues down the long hall. When they arrive near the center the ravens in the roof and rafters take wing closing in on the invaders.
"So this is where [[Shoko]] summoned them from." - G *readying his bow*

## Battle in the long hall

#### Part 1

1. 

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] draws one of her blades and slashes and punches at the assailing murder immediately knocking some of them out of the air.
[[Zio]] recites an incantation and performs some arcane movements with his hands.
A frozen shadow steps out from a doorway further down the long hall.
One of the flocks of ravens descends on [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] pecking and clawing to little effect due to his agility.
Another mass swarms around his head attempting to peck out his eyes and fails in it's efforts.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] slashes out with both blades in retaliation ending several more birds.
[[Uksahkka]] screams in pain as another of the flocks manages to gouge at her eyes blinding her.
[[Wei yan]] scurries past [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and spits out a gout of flame roasting one of the whirlwinds of ravens.
[[Uksahkka]] swings blindly in a panic at her assailants and misses.
A door bursts open next to [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] surprising him and revealing another [[Tengu]] who looks equally surprised at the scene before him.
Another tengu appears and stabs [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]].
[[Grayson]] takes note of more [[Tengu]] appearing to the south from doors further down the long hall and attempts to keep them from joining the fray with surpressing fire stepping between shots toward his targets.
[[Helgarval]] mimics [[Wei Yan]] and roasts the unprepared ravens.
Someone fires an arrow [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] but narrowly misses. 
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] is blocking a doorway still stemming the flow of Ninja from one of the rooms. 
	
2. 
	
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] strikes out with more of her martial arts devastating more of the circling ravens and then vanishes.
[[Zio]] disappears in one place and appears in another performing more arcane incantations and movements and fires a blast of heat at the last of the frenzied ravens.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] reaches into his belt pouch and pulls out a handful of caltrops which he scatters across the floor in front of the crowded doorway.
[[Wei yan]] continues spitting fire upon the enemi[[Ukshaka|es.
Uks]]haka still blinded remains in place unsure of what to do.
One of the freshly singed ninja passes across the caltrops and leaps back favoring an injured foot.
[[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] touches [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] with a want rejuvenating him.
Another ninja attempts to pass through the caltrop filled portal also gaining a limp but continues on to strike at [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and misses.
[[Grayson]] continues to stem the tide of ninja attempting to reinforce from further south in the hall with a hail of arrows stepping further towards them.
[[Helgarval]] continues adding to the flames started by [[Wei Yan]].
One of the ninja fires his own bow at [[Grayson]] who is unharmed as 
Another swings past [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]].
	
3. 
	
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] narrowly misses a ninja with her own blades in return.
[[Zio]] sprays a contained blizzard from his hands at the foes and two more of the ninja slump.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] closes on the ninja too cautious to traverse the caltrops going the the door into one of the rooms off of the long hall. 

### Down the chute
Inside ten sleeping pallets lay neatly arranged about this room. At the foot of each is a small locker for personal belongings and an open iron trapdoor sits in the floor and near the east wall.

#### Part 2

Inside [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]s blade meets with the flesh of his targetand finishes it.
[[Wei Yan]] joins [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] in the room running along the wall to leap at the last remaining foe slashing as he does.
[[Uksahkka]] continues to hold position blinded.
[[Grayson]] finishes [[Wei Yan]]s work with a few more arrows.
The remaining human shadow sprints to the trap door and throws itself down and out of sight.
	
4. 

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] gives chase and after a moment of confused sounds from below the rest of the caravaneers just hear 
"Trolls!" Called louldy back up.

### The Furnace Room
The room below is a furnace room sweltering from the effort. The coals in the rooms namesake roar opposite the chute [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] just entered from. A heap of coal is stacked against the east wall and an iron door opens in the ceiling above the coal pit. Three crude beds made of poorly cured bear skins and wolf pelts have been thrown on the floor before the fire. A Hog's head, rests between them next to the bloody bones of someone unfortunate creature.
	
The two Troll occupants look up from the boar they were enjoying at their two unexpected guests.

#### Part 3

[[Zio]] with a word and a flourish creates several copies of himself and enters the room past the caltrops.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] darts down the trap door after [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] arriving next to her and the fleeing ninja. Seeing that [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] is up to her shinobi tricks again and the ninja is stunned face down on the floor in the face of the trolls [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] buries a sword in his back ending his life.
	
It is at this point that the rooms occupants begin to react the faster of the two commenting.

>"Look what we got 'ere, Tasty li'il bird."

And he strikes [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]].
[[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] also arrives down the chute gracefully on her feet.
>"Oh... You're just right there."

The other Troll steps up and also attemps to sink his claws into [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]].
[[Grayson]] hesitates to follow his companions and leave Ukshaka defenseless and alone watches her feel her way to a curtain and duck behind it and gives chase. Landing just as gracefully as [[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] he looses an arrow before even fully coming to rest at the bottom of the chute finding the flesh of one of the disturbed diners.
	
5. 
	
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] carves a piece off of one of the Trolls with a deft blade who promptly begins bleeding profusely.
[[Zio]] joins the fray clambering down the chute himself and upon view the scene in the furnace room applies extra heat to the situation firing a cone of searing flames from his hands onto the trolls.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] zeroes in on the weakness of the more ailing of the two trolls that [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] had carved up and levies a few strikes at it very nearly felling it.
[[Wei Yan]] makes his way to the fray clambering over [[Zio]] to fire his own cone of flames at the trolls.
The visibly flagging troll falls with a boom to the floor after this onslaught.
Koya puts a hand on [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]'s shoulder filling him with healing energies.
The still standing furnace denizen lashes out at [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] wildly missing on all counts.
[[Grayson]] sends several more arrows into the flesh of the troll in response.
[[Helgarval]] spews yet more fire from his mouth on both trolls
	
6. 
	
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] steps up to the remaining troll drawing out her second blade and scores vicious blows sending him to the floor to join his roomate.
[[Zio]] draws out his mace and brains the helpless foe ending the danger.

##
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] mutters a prayer under his breath for the life lost.

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"You keep praying like that and the gods might actually listen"</mark> - N

Surveying the room they find a poorly hidden stash, presumably belonginging to the trolls, under a very thin layer of coals. Inside are gold armbands and a small sack of amethysts.

Now out of the clamor of combat they are able to look around and see another hallyway out of the other side of the furnace room [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] leading the pack steps forward to get a closer look. It is a flooded passage. A deep channel of flowing water crosses. The hall here on the opposite side lies, a heavy timber plank a brass bell, and Clapper hanging from the wall on this side of the stream. 

>"Scion of Amatatsu you have come to retrieve me from this place of darkness. You are close now. They have cast me into some sort of dark pit. Seek me out." - T
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Do they have a Ameiko? Have you seen her? Is she alive?!"</mark> - O
>"I assume this is the Amatatsu you serve?" - T
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"Yes!"</mark> - O
>"I have not touched her mind in this place." - T
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"They've captured her and I hope they're holding her here... We will need your help."</mark> - O

Seeing everyone else's looks as he has this mental dialouge [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] turns to them.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"I hear... the voice of the sword... I think the sword is here and it's speaking to me."</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"How hard did you get hit by the troll?"</mark> - N 

looking at [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] quizically.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] grabs her arm and pulls her closer to the underground stream. 

>"Ah, There are multiple scions." - T
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Oh, okay. That's unnerving."</mark> - N
>"It is good to see the rise of the Amatatsus once more" - T

Now closer and with the others stepping forward as well they party deliberates the way forward. North, South, or the door across the hall.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"The sword. I believe is this way. I think it would be very helpful."</mark> - O

Nodding forwards.
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Certainly so long as we're not going to get jumped by any further surprises this time around"</mark> - N

She steps forward examining the door to the south carefuly for traps and finding none. The door is locked however but [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] expertly applies some mechanical trickery and the door clicks and cedes ingress.

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Now what do you have locked up."</mark> - N 

easing the door open.

The ceiling of this Grand Chamber rises 20 feet overhead. It's heavy beam serving as both Raftors and supports for the great hall above. Teak paneling covers the walls and the floors of polished wood. Along the walls wooden columns rise to the ceiling above bearing banners and emblazoned with pictograms from far off [[Tian Xia]]. Above these hang small oil lamps that give up a dim glow. A small, porcelain bowl rests before the center column to the south and four reed mats are arranged before it.

><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"I think we go this way."</mark> - O
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"I suspect this might be their equivalent of a Dojo."</mark> - N

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] steps in to the room and after nothing unexpected happens his fellows follow him.
The caravaneers spread out across the dojo noting the numerous doors leading from the large main room.
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] quietly edges one open to peek into the interior.
Inside she appraises and shirtless and loose pant clad muscled human meditating with his back turned. He does not notice [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]'s presence. She edges into the room without a sound drawing one of her blades as she does. 

## The Dojo
### The First

0. 
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] attempts to eviscerate him but at the last second he gracefully leaps out of the way.
1. 
Before he can fully recover [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] presses her advantage levying another swing at him which he again narrowly dodges but cannot manage it on the second blade. He slumps to the floor silently.
###

With the enemy neutralized [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] takes stock of the contents of the room and finds Inside are three beautiful jade raven statuettes, a short spear of master quality, and an amulet made of beast scales. [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] examines and then stows these items then emerges from wherever she had vanished to covered in a great deal of blood.

The others unaware of this creep up to various other doors. [[Grayson]] similarly to [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] quietly edges open another door. He is not as successful in supressing his presence from the occupant.

### The Rest of the Class

0. 	
Before he can fully react to [[Grayson]]'s Intrusion an arrow sprouts from his chest and he cries out alerting any other enemies who may be nearby.
1. 	
[[Zio]] who is still in the larger hall produces a wand from his belt readying himself for trouble at the cry.
[[Grayson]] finishes the bleak work he started and snuffs out his target before he can do anymore.
One of the doors bursts open and [[Zio]], prepared for this, fires off several bolts of magical energy from his wand at the new enemy a similarly garbed human.
Still standing after the magical barrage the dojo dweller returns a missile in kind in the form of a spear hurled just past [[Zio]].
[[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] who was lingering near the door into the large room hurries forward to assist.
Another human bursts forth from yet another door. Their eyes settle on [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] and they launch a spear just past her.
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] having casually dodged that 

><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"What was sensei doing with you."</mark> - N

Another student clamours out of their room adds to the spears on the floor of the room with another miss.
2. 
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] closes quickly on one of the students forcing them to dodge her slashes.
in return one of the students reinforces their peer and strikes [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] with a spinning kick.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] evens the odds for [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] bringing his blades to bear on the pair flanking [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] scoring a hit.
[[Zio]] unleashes a boulder of snow and Ice impacting one of the trained fists.
[[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] whips her starknife across the room only to have it deflected in the same manner Omeyani had done previously. To the students surprise though the star knife flies back to Koyas hand.
[[Grayson]] seeing the technique again takes advantage of their distraction to dispatch them with two arrows. His third is sent at another only to have them deflect it in the same fashion.
The surrounded [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] continues to be beset with fists and feet taking another blow from her masters students.
3. 
She returns strikes in kind.
[[Wei Yan]] and [[Helgarval]] do fire stuff but their foes are too quick.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] circles around to even the odds. Attempting to cut him off his quarry scores a stab with a spear across his shoulder. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] weathers it and levels his sword before swinging at one of the encirclers.

>"Why don't you try me instead." - O

His blow while full of intent still misses.
[[Zio]] narrowly misses clubbing another student with his mace.
[[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] closes the distance to [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] and with a touch uses [[Desna]]'s Grace to mend some of her copious wounds.
4. 
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] still spewing blood

>"I appreciate you trying."

[[Grayson]] fires at the unarmed attacker next to [[Zio]] with such a strong draw and precision that their inevitable maneuver to deflect missiles does not stop the shaft.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] continues harrying [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]'s Outflankers but can't connect.
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]]'s assailants continue pressing their advantage landing even more blows.	
5. 	
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] deftly steps around her opponent to change the battlefield to her advantage pressing her attackers back but not connecting with any strikes.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] continues to not be able to cause any real damage to their enemies.
[[Zio]] returns to his wand tactic pinpointing magical energies to fell one of the remaining students.

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] says a prayer for the dead.
[[Grayson]] collects belongings from the students and their rooms including the quality crafted spears.

The room the battle left the [[Amatatsu Scions|Scions]] in contains a meditation screen of obviously Tian Ming style. Behind the screen is a small leather trunk. 
inside they find a washer woman's clothes and other possessions, including a disguise kit, an ornate decorative blowgun fashioned from Jade and lapis lazuli, gold pieces in [[Tian]] coins, and a writ signed by [[Sveinn Blood-Eagle]] that gives the bearer the authority to commandeer any of the Linnorm Kings housecarls within two miles of [[Places/Golarion/Inner Sea/Saga Lands/Land of the Linnorm Kings/Kalsgard/Kalsgard|Kalsgard]] for up to 12 hours.

> <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Do what you want with this? Take it. Burn it. i don't care."</mark> - N

[[Grayson]] takes extra care searching what was clearly [[Omoyani]]'s room after finding those items but nothing else is found.
With that the group heads back east towards the water and places the plank across the gap.
After crossing [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] notices the sound of even more water coming from one of the doors in the hallway.
When she mentions this [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] moves to the door and inspects it for traps and not noticing anything he opens the door.
Inside is revealed a natural cavern 30 feet across and 15 feet high. A waterfall pours in through a small aperture high on the south wall filling a turbulent pool in the floor and sending a cold spray throughout the room. A smooth ledge extends outward from the door and two large barrels have been set to the right of it. Another ledge sits on the far side of the pool. A smaller cask sits on this ledge next to a heavy wooden door.

After the group surveys the water for danger [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] begins undressing to swim across
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] seeing this sprints across the water supernaturally light on her feet.
When reaching the other side she finds the barrels empty but the cask whole and full containing sake and an aspergillum resting on top.

Once the others have crossed [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] steps up to the door on the far side and asks [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] to look at it.
She removes her glasses and wipes some of the blood from the earlier fight off of them and looks at the door after replacing them upon her face.
She finds nothing out of place only that it is locked which she makes short work of anyways and opens it.


The room inside is small and musty. Hewn from solid rock near the far wall stands a low well, it's opening only a foot in diameter. A winch and chain with a rusted steel bucket hang from the wall above it. In the far corners sits a pile of old wooden buckets and other debris, rotten and broken with several different kinds of fungi growing on their remnant.

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] being the first in looks down the well squinting. 
While the closer portion is very dim, far down at the bottom is much brighter as it contains a [[Te No Sui|Katana]] that is alight with orange and gold flames.
Peering through the only foot diameter hole
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"This would be very problematic if..."</mark> - N

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] clears her throat loudly and looks around searching for [[Wei Yan]] who has just made his way into the room at the back of the pack.

>"What... Who throws one of those down a well?! -W
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"Fancy retriving a relic for us?"</mark> - N

[[Wei Yan]] grumbles a bit but deftly makes his way into the well and down toward the blade.

>"I didn't sign up for this" - W

He grunts with effort to push the [[Te No Sui|Katana]] before him up the well.

As he makes it someway up from the bottom he feels a rope brush across his head as he is fully emperors new grooving it up the well shaft.

>"Why didn't we just do that in the first place." - W
><mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">"It was way, way funnier to do it this way."</mark> - N

Patiently waiting for him to fasten the rope to [[Te No Sui|the sword]]
>"I'm filing a complaint with the Heavenly Bureau." - W

As he tugs on the rope to let [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] know she can start bringing [[Te No Sui|the sword]] up.
>"That can wait till we have Ameiko back"

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] brings it up and over the edge and unties it.

So this beautiful blade made an ancient [[Tian]] style is almost beautiful in it's simplicity and still in perfect condition. It's scabbard is black and glossy and the wrapped handle appears to be made of some form of leather that you're not familiar with. The gold accoutrement are shining still. 

[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] Wrings a cloth out and wipes off whatever dust and debris managed to attach itself to the weapon in the well and holds it out toward [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] who accepts it gently.
><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"You're free my friend"</mark> - O
>"[[Amatatsu Scions|Scions]] of Amatatsu you have my thanks for the rescue. I am glad to see things finally unfolding as i have seen them. I was concerned when the [[Oni]] had me stolen before you arrived. I did not foresee that part." - T

##### left off here

So this might be a little bit of a fine detail. Does does [[Zio]] know anything about what we're talking about with scions and such because he wasn't there. When the the seal was opened and we were made into Scions, he does not We've just been and the seal has not been opened again. 

He's kind of like thinking what's what the hell they talking about. He also can't hear the sword. So, that whole conversation, you guys just was just us talking to a sword while he stands behind us, Though. He might think you're all crazy.

I think is a little late for thinking whether or not we are crazy. And potentially just receiving confirmation at this point.


Which won't be honest. I'm going this way. Think somewhere here, just organic sled me.

You didn't realize yeah, the answer is now though.
Let's drop is a lot. Is it anything? It is that and now it's scroll back all the way up there.

Do you want? Just love how OG? Just kidding me. 

Moving forward. Yep. Boom. The stairs to send into a plain room of mortared. Stone walls, drip, with convincation giving the air a cold claimy feel, but you were supposed to be coming down the stairs over here.

Looks head back up, shall we?

Is the laboratory This room has been hewn from the rock of the Crag and a wooden stare rises along the walls, able some workbenches filled with chamber, holding all matter of Olymp Olympic Crucibels, burners, and assorted tools, as well, as a large glass case, holding one appears via humanoid body. A variety of dried herbs and plants dingle and perfusion from hooks in the bottom of bears and sex and chests. Hold additional equipment and components and have been shoved underneath the stairs. A torch mounted on one of the stairs stair pose illuminates. The chamber with a flickering glow, 

is this where they made you no way.
She gives you a look as, if to contradict you and then goes.

perception check.
The body is wriggling. Not like the body is still alive. Like there's something in the body. Like, lots and lots of small things and they are eating it.

It doesn't actually say how it opens though, I'm assuming. One of the yeah, the top or bottom. Probably comes off, cool. Oh, she's gonna take out a rope. No, it doesn't. And then he's gonna tie the lid closed.


---

Of the alembics, crucibels, burners and assorted tools, as well as a large glass case holding what appears to be a humanoid body. A variety of dried herbs and plants tangle, and perfusion from hooks on the bottoms of the stairs and sax, and chest holding additional equipment components, have been shoved underneath the stairs, a torch mounted on one of the stairs post illuminates, the chamber with a flickering glow,

knowledge check

So terrifying only, let's not talk to them. Only infernal, though, I mind when hell wasps swarms together. They gain an intelligence of six and the ability to use skills and feats and can speak infernal with a voice made up of an amalgamation of their constant. Droning, I have more of a big curiosity to hear what that sounds like.

That would be super cool. I mean, I definitely don't have the vocal structure required to reproduce that, no, I get that. I'm just like, that's you know, what I mean? That's, that's really cool.
And so inside that knowledge check, do we know they're alignment as being like hecka, evil, definitely evil. Okay. They are bourbon from hell literally.
And so their prerogative is to like, go around and do more, horrible wasp stuff to people and make more wasps, they're gonna crawl inside your body, eat out all of your insights and then lay more hellwah, figs than you.
Not necessarily in that order. These are extreme. That's fun. Evil creatures. I say we open it and take them out at [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]'s. Gonna just put a hand on your shoulder. I don't, I don't think that's a very good idea. [[Grayson]]. I say we leave these where they are and just gonna concurrent poppy and paste their defensive line or you guys.
Swarms are serious business. Kind of insane. Yep. And this worm has improved initiative and toughness and the stealth of plus 24. That is insane. There's a reason they said to make sure that the players don't open this tube. You think were killing you. Wow. Okay, 

05:42

Yeah, I will say that seems like a pretty damn good deal. Yeah, It's pretty heavy amount of stuff. But that's what we brought way in, for he can totally carry that.
The monkey kind of just looks at you. Affronted A ringer counter spells, an empty ring of counter spells.
And we came up from here. So, we haven't actually come across this staircase yet here, which I'm good leads up.

You would be correct in this. Okay, let's can we unpause? So we can move around. I was going to. Yep. So sorry, visually see the staircase and just confirm that it goes up. In case we need to retreat to familiar territory. I can't collides with the wall.

Do we work? Are we going to try to take all the equipment and components? Just because it weighs so much since we don't have a bag of holding that that we have to put stuff in.

One bag of holding yet? No, no, he has one but she hasn't really shared it with the group. Yeah, we need to get our hands on one So perhaps we can just grab it on our way out. Instead of lugging it all around currently, I'm gonna call out, this doesn't look super familiar up here.

I think this goes somewhere else, I thought it went back to the main floor. I mean most I have a handy habitat but that's a handy hackersack.

OG's, gonna take some more steps forward.
The OG has ended up the stairs.
Yeah, this all doesn't look familiar. The shoot must have been longer than we thought.

There's a room over here. The Stonewalls turned to heavy timbers. As this tower climbs above the long haul, This landing is dark limited. Only by what little light spills from the room below a steep narrow stare lacking any railing rises through it. Opening in the ceiling. 20 feet above be honest.

Anyway, beyond the stairs, a door side room. Which is that door there? I'm gonna check and see if it's trapped question. Mark very well.
Just a cursory. Look at it before. We touch it.

Those sort of trappings about it. Nope, no. Trappings OT's. Gonna try the door handle to see if it's locked. It is also not lost. Okay, everybody with me. I'm gonna swing this bad boy open. Perhaps stealthily. 
I will attempt to follow stealthily. Oh, hell yeah, dude.

You see this wear bear sitting at a desk with a bottle of wine, this chamber, actually, reaps of stale wine, ring, sweat and wild animals for a rough bed. Sits at the far end in a pot belly stove, rests between the windows next to a cold bucket cross on the stove is a small table holding several empty wine skins and a small oaken statue wet where the werebear Jordan. The ax is currently sitting. 

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] closes the door and he's gonna turn to everyone in a really hush voice and say, the wear bears on the other side of the store. I don't necessarily want to cause any harm to him. He's being controlled. This none of the things that he's doing or to his normal attitude or will. I think we should maybe leave him be for the time being. There's no other rooms in there where I think a mako could be. It's just his bedroom.
No one has raised an alarm yet and he is perfectly content to drown his sorrows and wine for the moment. I think I'm really leaving him to his pain. I'm surprised that huge fight at the entrance wasn't having the alarm raised, 

So let's head back. Perhaps up the stairs further or down the stairs because we came from these stairs here. There were other doors down here. Yeah, down on the other level but I was trying to get back up to the main level. So we know how to get back. You should check the other doors down there. Oh gee. Here's the voice of God and they go back downstairs.

no way has just been sitting in here staring at the wasps making faces of them. I can't move stuck in a loop. I got you.

Well to get back down right now but I mean previously yeah to get here from the lower level, where the sword was we came up from those stairs and just now, we went Also up those stairs and checked all that stuff out. And then came back down the same stairs.
I'm just trying to orient myself. You are correct. Okay.

Oh, she's gonna step up to this one and just track. Try the handles. See if it's locked. It is not. So he cracks it open and then slowly opens it. And what do we see? 

This cramped, corridor runs from one side of the long haul to the other multiple doors open. At either end in all manner of boxes bags, chests and crates have been stacked against the walls. The Raptors hold hooks and nets from which hang additional supplies, a staff room, All the various tools equipment and non-perishable supplies necessary for the maintenance and up Ravens, cracker stored in this hallway, Nearly any sort of mundane tool can be found here, including a portable forage, and a set of masterworks Smith's tools. Yo Hmm. One in everyone is a room of stuff.

[[Grayson]]'s gonna go to this other door down here, and it's gonna try opening it really. It's just little. Listen at it first. Emiru 30 there. It sounds like there's someone in there. 
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] gonna. That sounds humanoid. I. Yeah, I mean, it sounds like a human breathing and  [[Grayson]] turns to [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] and just kind of given odd until Oh she's gonna draw his weapons. Eric Cousin all all open the door. Not stalkfully. That door is locked, Right? He points at no way and like Beckens her towards the door.

I am no way. Pushes glasses up nose immediately picks the lock immediately picks the lock and then steps to the side. I'll go through first [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] will do exactly what [[Grayson]] would have done and just open the door. Oh cool. There's a guy, there is a guy who is clearly emaciated and malnourished. Kind of pushed up against the back wall. As the light pours into his one stark room, he closes his eyes and pain of No, no. My name is loot,

guys. There's sick loot in here who are recent shoots an arrow at [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]'s. The back of his neck. I was looking at loose one. That did it. Oh, she's looking at looking at Lou. What does he look like? Is he like doing recognize like the color is he's wearing or it looks like he was once dressed and buying merchants guard. But the months that he spent in this room subsisting on the very meager food that they give him and likely whatever rats, he was able to catch has left him very weak from malnutrition and fever Though. He doesn't seem to have any major injuries on him.

Oh, she's gonna put his swords away. And take a knee in front of this guy and tell him, 
We mean you no harm. We're here looking for some of our friends. We're we're not here to hurt you. In any way? What is your name? I'm [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] Suite,
loot hackers sly. 
Hello Lou. Nice to meet you. 
Don't? I wish you don't work for silver score. 
No, I wish we were meeting under better circumstances. We are very much at odds with the deceptive. Silver score. Do you know? Silver scores? True nature.
Yes, she seems to be some sort of strange. Purplish. Red ogre. 
She is an only in a demon in that odds, with my liege, who they've captured, have you heard or seen them bring anyone in since you've been here? How long have you been here? 
I don't know. I lost count of the days. I was a member of the Reim Runner, Guild Board of shareholders. I voted against a measure that she proposed and I was taken in the night and brought here. 
Well, we can really have for you. You seem to be of good nature and upstanding nature. We're happy to help you get out of here. We just need to find our friends. First We are looking for the guide off Gormander as well as bookshaka the apprentice and our our dear friend Amico. 

[[Grayson]] sense motive, this guy. And what he has said, so far you are more than welcome to. He is completely and utterly telling the truth. 

Are you well enough to travel?
I will travel to get away from this terrible place. There's, There's another one like her. We don't is green with big tusks. He was the one that questioned me the most. 
It wasn't silver score. But another only you think like silverscore. 
He was green though, not like her. 
Hmm, that's very good to know. Thank you for sharing. Have you seen any other special dangers folk like that around.
We've seen many of the frozen shadows themselves. But no, no leaders. Like Kim and Dotsu so far silver score.
So even her name is false, 
you'd be correct.
I heard someone being dragged in a couple of days ago, She was putting up quite the fight. 
That's good to know that she was still alive when she was brought here. Like we said, we're more than happy to help you escape this place but we do have business to attend to first.
If you're well enough that you think you can go down, you're we won't stop you but it might be best to wait until we've maybe dealt with some more of and enforces that dwell here.
I am in no condition to make the truck all the way back to Kel's garden. If there's a place I may wait for you nearby. 
Yeah we could we this is room nearby or another companion of ours is waiting. You could join her there. 
Yes, we could put you with oakshaka and you could help watch over each other. I know Shaka and gold Goremenders names. They are good. People just very acceptable. 
Yes, she was blinded and we did not want to endanger her more. So, perhaps you can watch over each other. 
If anyone comes, I will tell her where to swing. 
That would be perfect.
So and he'll reach out a hand for him and kind of if he wants to put his arm over your shoulder and help him walk and then escort him over to where Okshaka is hanging out. 
We have a spare blade for this. Fine gentleman.
I got a dagger. I can give him.
I'm sure. I I may look a proud alphan but I have little skill in arms.
God, used the wrong answer. Like some protection still better than nothing though. 
At this point, I will fight to live. If you can spare weapon, I will take it. 
That is good. You like to hear that?
Why don't you tell us more about what what they've kept you here for? He said they've been asking you questions. What kind of questions? 
I don't know, really and I don't understand the goatee. The one that keeps questioning me. I don't know what he's after.
Can you give us an example of a question that he asked you?
He was the one that handled my food and he would ask me how I felt after I ate it. 
Oh,
show goes going to cast. Detect magic. There's there's nothing going on with them.
Koya Korea. I'll get poison, there's nothing currently afflicting him, but there's a bit of a lingering trace of poison like someone was testing poisons on him. Mmm.
Not an enviable position to be in. Let's get you off to Ushaka. You should be safer there. 

So we'll throw him over my shoulder a little bit and walk him towards the door. We were out before thinking.

Okay, wine and food stores. This room is dark and cold and numerous barrels, baskets and sacks are stacked about the room butchered carcasses primarily sheep, but a few hogs as well, along with bundles of roots, tubers and herbs. Hang from the wooden rappers overhead. And in one corner sits a clay pot filled with what looks like fresh honeycomb.

The food stuff room and keep in mind. I've got the tech magic up for six minutes. So tell me if that means anything it does not. It's mundane food stuffs in here
this room is Bart from the side. All you have to do is lift the bar up and it unlocks the door.

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] will ask [[Grayson]] or showco to come over and grab the other side of a bar? Because he's only got one arm right now. Kristen why He's helping the old man walk. Okay, we'll pop those bad boys off.

Stay. Well, friends we will come back When we have Mako in hand.

Is that the bird that I smell? 
Yes, we found one of the previous board members of the Rheim Runner's Guild that they took who defied Kim and Dotsu. He's very ill. We brought him here to help. Watch your back and keep both of you safe.

Come friends. You will be my eyes and I will make you a pulses to help with your Everything situation. 
yes. I also have some jerky here. Oh, hell yeah. 
Oh geez. Like kind of get something. We think them have been testing poisons on him, So these probably still got a bit of that, in this system.

OT now realizes, there's a door in this room that I don't know that we've been through before. You have not. He's gonna just try that handle real quick. It opens just fine. Let's see. Full moon. This is eight little boom. 

So after actually searching this room now, you do find all of this.
That's cool. A bunch of swag, a bunch of swag.

All right, watch over each other. We must continue on Be safe.

What do you guys think? Which way should we go? I guess back to all the humor they were like to the doors that we haven't been to.
Oh, we at night. There's one other don't we haven't meant to yet?
He'll check the door for traps.
It may perception. Check. What is this See? Denote. Does that denote anything that we can see in the feeling? There's a trapdoor. Oh, what is the ceiling? I'm pretty sure it's the ceiling. Yes, a trapdoor in the ceiling. That is not hidden. Oh, there's a door to the south here, too.

I didn't even see that if you don't find any traps and you hear the distinct sound of looking.
The real sex back.
He says I hate cooking. I hate clicking sounds. I don't know what it is, but it's looking. I'm gonna try the handles here. If it's locked. It's not locked. Stealthily crack the door open.

Wow. Okay, So you said four frozen shadow ninjas just going about their day cooking.

Stones. Roofed with steeply. Sloping thatch has been constructed against the walls of the main hall and adjacent cliff base. You massive ovens occupy, the south wall and a number of tables, and trestles have been set up about the room for food preparation.

OG's gonna leave the door, just slightly a jar so you can see through it and not touch it and turn around and just tell everybody. There's, there's several more than ninjas in here.
OG is then gonna kick the door open and charge in.

Theo, you're surprise around mover standard. It can be standard.
I'm gonna have, I'm gonna have to five foot step. Sadly. Now, I can cast it for more I'm at, and I don't have to worry about hitting a [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]].
Hey, how would you? Now I need the ninjas. All three of many way. No, all four of them.
No, that does miss this one. Oh and why is it show it on the on the thing because where you originally dropped it? It hit all of them. Okay, All right. So as you can also take free actions during the surprise round.

And choco.

I start  performance Yeah, that's my turn. 
All right, that is good. Do nothing. Okay. Then Consuming arrow and sure. Yep, racing test arrow.
kills the first ninja. 
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]]. Oh, gee is going to zoom up in between all of them and pull out his weapons.

Way young, I put steps.
On that close enough.
And boom. Yeah, no I said not close enough.

zio You will probably walk forward playing out his mace, I proceed to beat it with a beat the ninja in front of them.

hoka will just take out his sword and Run on in. lose the door behind him. I'll switch back to YouTube and take a swing at this guy. That here and staggers him

ninja Nice to attack you with butcher knife. He's holding.
And misses that does not hit. And he takes one damage because he was staggered. Yeah. Oh yeah. He drops.

noe
Oh, great thing. You not doing anything. He moved 10 foot and then opened a door. It's door got slammed in his face. He was gonna be like, oh, there's another door over here. I'll go open it. Who close the door behind them, you know? Okay. Yeah, well if that's the case then.

Oh, she's gonna do that.
And I will roll to avoid if I need to, you will need to. But remember the Acrobatic thing cuts your movement in half. That's true. So what am I at right now? Actually, maybe 25. I think yeah, it's a you were here. So Yeah, I wouldn't be able to do that.

58:16

Basically, You could get right up to him. That defeats the purpose of what I want to do. I'll just take the attack of opportunity. butcher knives. Yeah, he hit So I'll take that and then in retaliation, I'm going to balk him. I'm gonna do a bonk.
I forgot to target him. It's okay, open.
Anything else on your turn? I think that's it.
The door slowly creeks open with a monkey hanging from the handle.

I'm sorry. 
call. You was trying to target herself. She hates stabbing people in the back, but these are bad people. 

[[Grayson]]'s gonna go search, the room that he's in, because even though we killed the people in it earlier, we didn't actually search it. I don't think no, you did not see seven.

It doesn't bunk sand haphazardously about this room soon with rumpled bedding assorted clothing and personal items. And the discarded remains of food and empty plates. You have the north door. Sit, two stain foul smelling buckets that are apparently not empty frequently enough.


The hidden Dell, a pitched purest. Delle squeezes between the steeply sloping flanks of the nearby crabs that rise a hundred feet or more of overhead narrow waterfall rushes. The notorian down one of these slopes and collects and they catch pawn next to a batch roof lean-to with two large fieldstone chimneys, which is the kitchen a small torrent exist in this pond wending. Its way towards the Great Hall where it disappears into a metal great in the halls foundation apart from the lean to leads over a narrow. Bridge of rough sawn logs, arching over the stream and further down the defile until it is lost among the rocky outcroppings beyond Interdasking.

I like to thank you luck. Noah, and a room full of various little chemical stuff. And she's basically just being helping herself for the last few minutes while you guys were murdering stuff in the background. 

Numerous wooden bed frames. Look real mattresses occupy. This sparsely furnished room. It does not appear that. Anyone has used this room recently, but it could quarter as many as a dozen.

And he's gonna go up here and check the closet because we found a bunch of stuff in the other one. Nope, this room is empty. Dang. All right, folks, 

Do we want to go back to where we found? Are board member friend, and try and go back up those stairs up, the tower. Or should we try and go down the stairs off of the long haul. 
Let's go up to the second story of the long haul, okay? 
But I said what that what we said. 
Let's do it. 
I mean I think I like going up if I was a ninja overlord that's where I'd be.

What other Natalie? What. Yeah, what's the point of having a big castle? If you don't really enjoy the view to make people think that you would be in the big funny tower when you'd actually stick a wizard in there.

Well, Let's flip that coin.

So we check these oh yeah. Upper closets. Here's the trapdoor, by the way.

Oh, she's gonna try the handle on this one. It is locked.

And one of the other side. So over here is the height table and these are a bunch of other eating tables.

This is the trapdoor that leads directly to the hall beneath.

No. Wait, you just did you go past the high table over here?

Yeah, you would probably assume this as much because chart, but let's see some scald words, roughly carved into the table. With dagger point 

Time is the coin of fools rendered due onto the gods.

Beams carved in stable, where snoring stone? I would have said. Hmm. Oh cool. We've got mad Rambling in here, too. Fantastic. What was that again?

Was words [[Grayson]] since no ways on the other side.
You're pretty good at these sorts of lock things, right? Could you take a look at this? 

Before we do anything  shook us, gonna recast like magic because he's got a funny feeling. Do I get anything? Nope. No magic. Mmm. Well, the way because we can just talk across the hall. Is that one locked on the other side?

the cloakroom. This room holds cloaks and cold weather clothing to outfit the occupants of the hall through the long winters in addition valuable furs and males of raw wood appeared from the old super super here. 
Unique rifle through pockets, nobody happens to have anything in the might suggest wearing us, except things, you know, things being people that are vaguely important. 
perception. Check for those. Searching the room
over a 17 you discover several roles of leather covered in tiny cramps scalded runes stuffed into one chest appear to be the personal diaries of snoring, stone, eye and relates. Not only his vile past but also details of his apocalyptic revelation.

01:15:28

Apocalyptic. You say, Indeed Anyone that can read scald make me a linguistics check?

You find in the rantings. Something we're referring to a concealed cash in the upstairs, flu. I didn't away for the coming winter. Also, in that room is all displayed old snorty. Had a little holiday stash. I thought that sunk with him. Sudden apparently he did very well first until we go and find that stash doing a murder and stuff. There's a reason he was called the Mad River. Where would that flu be? i think you're kind of just hand waving that. But where would that at the end of the haul? It says in the upstairs flu. I don't even know what a flu is. It's a fireplace thing.

If someone could move me would be greatly appreciated. I can't quite be my computer right now, you

Say the stores locked. Good. It is 29. It's open 

wooden pegs on the walls of this chamber holds shields and scabbards wooden sands. Hold chainmail, hobler, Hallbergs and open chest sold arrows, and axes, a number of spheres have also been stacked together in one corner. This room is Raven crabs Armory and there is magic in here.

Oh, there is a single magical arrow in the 225 arrows. In the chest. Oh, Starcraft Fold story, really didn't spare any expense? 

Yes, smell crap. Please.

And the bum. Do they single greater magical beast? Slang arrow. No. I spend that around and hand it over to Greyson.

Well, I think we found everything. We're going to find up here. 

Oops. It never unlocked the door for you. It's all right. So long as a giant, spider thing doesn't creep out of it and try and eat me. Oh, that's absolutely going to happen. This is farm waiting for it.

But she just hear himself. Yeah, I'm just hoping the princess and decided to get herself into a bit of bother. I'll just be always there. A staggered low bat on the map.

And because I felt like it. Okay above. I didn't know, like it.

Oh we'll see too much fat. Would you preferred less fat as opposed to know that Just regular bat would have been acceptable? The boom and then with a screeching screaming sound. Oh, it's here. Several raven swarms drop from the openings in the ceiling.

initiative. Whatever. I don't want to fight the giant rear and swarms but they have eyeballs for you.

No. Okay. I guess I'm going to ready ready in action when they get caught within range then like I guess,
Here. I forget one of that more than that range. I will cast a spell. It'll be a  nowball okay. Hello.
Lose what you see important in reflex. Save.
All right. Play will technically be blind for one day.
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] They're too far away from me to really do anything. I will run all the way up into do some stab on this other one. Perhaps.
That hits.
zio casts snowball here and a bunch of frozen birds fall from the sky.
Koya heals
[[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] is gonna throw hands lands a strike

[[Grayson]]. pull out some blunt arrows, and we'll shoot at the swarm. killing them.
See, you don't need to be scared of all swarms. You guys can handle the ratings forms, just fine.

they look for the red feather raven and dont see it

Oh, close the cases. Now going to be smelling up, roasted bird for at least the next little while, but still no closer to finding what we're actually here for, I take it. Oh, and a frozenberg Township. Oh, I'm dessert. Wonderful.

So you guys have searched the entirely now of the first floor and second floor of the long novel. So the only places left are open to that tower or back down to the dungeon.

I think we're not towards the power for me to find that.
And if I don't know, here might as well Since we don't know whether she is up or down, triple up.

so we're heading for the tower, right?

This room off behind the staircase, is Jordan, the axis bedroom, where we left him alone to drink in his sorrows because he's level good and being forced to do.

How do you remove one of those? By the way that something we could remove from it. Well, then my case apparently you put it yourself into contact with an incredibly powerful artifact and it blats it off. But I get the suspicion that wouldn't work for him and more importantly you certain that he's so goodly intended.

It's true. Well, he seems sad so I didn't want to hurt him. He did, he was drowning in wine. It looked like I just sounds like something man, if you want to fight it you can go fight him. I'll stand right here and watch.

She now that you've laid some eggs and had them hatch, you've become very soft on us. 

I think you and I both know, I've been very soft the entire time. 
Yep, you're right. Oh excellent. Remember that one time? I spared some goblins. 
Oh boy, what just happened? He's just, 
Why would you do that?
That was what I say. All right, your backseat drivers. Get up here and die with me.

Above. There's about to be a lot of bird on bird violence right here. There's a super bird on bird violence going. Okay, I'm sorry. No, you you don't need to worry. They were waiting for someone to step up on the stairs before. This is against flat-footed as they popped out of invisibility, dang.

We've been thinking sneak attack. Hold on one second.

I don't think I have it yet. If you're looking for uncanny, you don't have it. Yeah, well I can take it from the flourishes for warrior poet too and I don't look, it doesn't look like I have. So yeah, that gets me. Yeah, you. Yeah. And it's back which is sick.

It is quick. So I took a stab and I took another stab, what you got too fast, but they're not get sneak attacks off on me. Oh, they do. Oh boy, I set up sneak attacks separately.

OG just goes of 23 points of damage outs.

And then the next encounter will be good.

Okay, koias right here.

The Tango like panic swings at helgarval.

The tower they are in has openings for windows that are open to the elements bringing in a chill from outside. A fireplace stands against one wall, it's ashes cold. next to a stack of firewood. A trapdoor with a wooden ladder leading to it opens in the ceiling to the southwest. Six light cots are spaced about this chamber with a small footlocker next to each

The chamber in the rear is empty of furnishings and the floor is splattered with bird droppings. The room's door has been removed but half open shutters bear many marks and scratches covering two arrow slits in the walls. A nest of ragged blankets and bits of thatch and straw lies against the center of this wall. Large black feathers are scattered about the room lying thickest around the nest and then the final one, This chamber holds this simple bed and a table.

The room next door holds a simple bed and table bearing a water pitcher and basin. A fireplace stands in the eastern wall.

shoko moves double move
No way. steps up and coup de grace tengu

zio tries to foil their invisibility with a cloud of glittery magic but they do not appear.
undetectable avian slashes Koya then appears.
Koya lashes out with her star knife in response knocking him out the window.

as everyone recovers from the fight the poison makes its way through koya

Does anyone have a way to deal with poison? - shoko

I didn't know better. I'd say you really want to die. - noe 

koya, is gonna cast spell on herself.

Koya resists the poison

Ochi puts his hand on koya's shoulder worried over her expression.
He continues worrying over her as Zio pulls out a potion
The group begins frantically feed Koya potions to restore her faster than the poison is killing her.

"Poisons don't do anything Noe. I'm making shit up says Grayson."

 Koya? Are you all right? Are you okay? Koya. Koya say something
 that was the most intense poison I've ever encountered.
 You are very, very strong my friend. I'm glad you're still with us.
 Pretty sure I saw stars there for a moment.
Tesla's not ready for you yet.
Here's my journey is not a defend.
You've got another 90 years in UI. Swear.
Ha, I hope not. 
So I think for today it's probably for the best that we get you back with the others - S
I would not want to leave you without your, I am. Alright, to go on
Only continue with us. If you can Kwaya, we dont' want to lose you
 [[Shoko]] shakes aside and says would you will be fine on our own for the rest of us? We don't
We will not, but you can say that
Koya casts another spell on herself restoring the rest of her health
See, that's not sure back. She's just little late,
Well trials and tribulations, young. Knowing that's not expect us to go through them. 
[[Grayson]], what were you doing over here? I nearly died,
 just enjoying the view. 
Ochi peers out of the window with him.
 Oh gee. Oh, hold this rope.

Noe rounds the corner as Grayson has one leg out the window. She looks at the pair of them, then the rope, then outside
"what are you trying to do."

Grayson finished clambering out and collects the remains of the bird only to start plucking it immediately. Also finding a scroll and a ring.
âWhat the actual fuck?â - O
âWhat, have you never killed and eaten a chicken before?â - G 
âI've never skinned a person who looks like you right next to you.â - O 
âYou don't look like him.â - G
Noe begins laughing hysterically.
âYour feathers may be blood red 'cause you're covered in blood all the time but you're not him.â - G
âMy own bloodâ - O 
"Can we get back to saving ameiko" 

The group then notices there's a trap door that goes through the ceiling.

Ochis murmurs a prayer to Hei Feng under his breath over all the dead Tengu and Ravens 
He sidles up to Shoko shortly after who is staring at the trap door
"Where does it go?"
As Shoko tests the ladder Ochi spots the fireplace. Remembering Snorri's writings he feels around and finds the mentioned stashed including Boots of Winterland.

Shoko by this time starts his way up the ladder opening the hatch. Above he finds the Rooks nest. A wooden platform has been built into the thatched roof of the tower. It is backed by wooden siding while the far edge is a sheer drop off to the veil below. The trap doors sits in the corner of the roof and a small wire coup with a wooden table next to it sits in the shelter formed by the roof's peak. The entire platform and joining roof are thick with bird droppings and numerous blackbirds flutter around and croak ominously.

Ochi takes the time to pull some food out and lure one of the ravens and snare it and stows it gently in his pack for later. That doesn't stop the raven from squawking angrily in a flurry of feathers.

Grayson spots something shiny among the bird droppings and recovers a diamond all the while watching Ochi's proceedings.

"Ochi are you able to talk to crows or Ravens?" - G
"No" - O
"See even more reason why you're not one of them." - G
"I'm going to follow Noe now." - O

The aforementioned is tapping her foot impatiently at the bottom of the tower.
Grayson shrugs rolling his eyes to Shoko and Zio.

Having found no sign of Ameiko or Kimmandatsu the party scours over the keep again mapping out as far as they have explored it searching for some passageway they may have missed. They find it when they retrace the Dojo downstairs in the storage closet. 

Inside the room is a brazier in the corner which glows faintly with red coals, it's smoke reminiscent of the stench of scorched flesh. A short bed with a headboard carved with the image of an open mouthed demon stands against one wall and a small table cluttered with books, scrolls, and a stuffed and mounted sturge sits across from it. A magic circle has been scribed in the center of the floor with chalk. Torn paper, bits of food and other debris are scattered about the room collecting in corners and under the bed and table. 

Ochi takes notice of the contents of the table.

The items on the table hold an assorted paraphernalia related to magic research including a partially scribed scroll of planar binding. The scroll is incomplete. The circle on the floor is an outline for a protective circle for use with the planar binding spell. Examination of the brazier confirms that strips of dried flesh have been burns in it to create the repellent odor.

"Horrifying." - O

"I do not know of any mantras that would involve stripping the flesh and wearing it on display like that." - N

As the group hovers over the circle to make sense of it a very large hand to crawls out from under the bed and leaps towards Ochi's face.

1.

Noe readies her blades to strike it out of the air but hears Koya yell out that bladed weapons will cause it to explode in a burst of sickness.
"It will wha--" - N
She quickly shifts her strike and punches it instead with her blade gripped in her fist.

"Why is so many things in here like this?" - N visibly annoyed.

Shoko reaches out to disrupt the undead hand but narrowly misses.

The hand retaliates but also fails to meet it's mark.

Ochi hearing Koya's warning plants a kick into the Giant Hand lacking the correct martial arts training though he leaves himself open and is stuck in kind by the creature.

Grayson rushes through the doorway and lands a kick of his own.

Koya also enters and places a hand on Ochi's shoulder mending him once again and then quickly lashes out with a glowing hand to cleanse the unliving hand.

Helgarval flies forward and charges past the hand missing.

2.

Noe lashes out unarmed again but does not connect.

Shoko tries again to disrupt the hand magically and connects with it.

Wei Yan cannot affect the hand so doesn't even try

The hand lunges at Ochi again but can't hit.

Ochi lashes back with fist but it's inneffective

Koya fills the hand with positive energy ending it's undeath

Looking around for an explanation for the strange goings on in here [[Grayson]] and [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] find a hidden compartment in the Demon's head's Mouth. [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] finds a secret trigger opening it right in front of the group. This reveals a staircase.

"I sense her. She is very angry" - T
"She's here!" - O

Ochi runs down the stairs.
Noe follows at a less frenetic pace.

This hallway widens into a small chamber with a door exiting through the south. The door is banded with white straps of iron and bears a large heavy lock. A single brazier provides dim lights to this area.
Ochi spots several shambling figures up ahead.

"There are people here." - O

Said figures turn to Ochi

"She said you would come." - Troll
"She was right." - O
"Are you ready to die." - Troll
"As ready as you are." - O

We killed the bandit horselords of the fort. 
After which Grayson reminds the group of the sword that Jiro wanted from the tomb under the shrine of shizuru. The party agrees and makes way to that part of the fort. 

Walking through without the haze of battle they notice how ancient the fortress is in spite of the additions made by the bandits. The stonework, in particular the hideouts carved into the mountain itself, are almost imperceptible. inluded in the amenities are a full sized bathhouse which the recent occupants had outfitted to function as a workshop, a well supplying clean drinking water, a full stable containing the very fine horses the plains bandits had aquired,  a common room able to accomadate a force of the size to utilize the fortification, a larger suite to suit a person in charge, a stocked armory, a room still filled with the cages where the slain had kept their slave holdings, and the forlon shrine to the dragon goddess previously mentioned. 

The walls of this room are covered and faded abstract decorations and riddled with cavities and cracks. Stone display tables stand along the north and south walls bare but for rusty metal shards and blackened splinters of wood. Numerous cartouches filled with inscriptions much of the symbology are carps. The statue once held the two-handed sword but the stone blade has been sheared off and many of the statues features have been defaced or destroyed.

Koya seeing the state of the statue murmurs some words and with a flourish of her hands restores the statue to it's former glory magically.

"That'll fix it I suppose." - N
"You're going to put all the masons out of business Koya." - S
"I think we are putting several industries out to dry single-handedly by virtue of existing." -N
"Then i am a true Varisian you know. We are Iconoclastic. I am doing my people proud." - K with a smile.

Upon closer inspection the tiny inscriptions inside the cartouches on the statue which are in Minkaian seem to be the names of samurai followed like expressions of thanks and prayers for good luck. Near the end there is a single inscription with no author's name, which reads

***
empress of heaven, touch me with your grace.
***
Ameiko removes the Amatatsu seal from the warding box and touches it to the statue. The cartouches flash with brilliant lights as a cylindrical pit opens in the center of the room revealing a repository of several weapons samurai would typically use including an adamantine katana the the tien characters for hirobashi engraved along the blade. The caravaneers recognize this as the sword of Hirobashi Akikaze that Jiro is searching for.

Having watched Ameiko open the warding box Noe makes it a point to be more wary at all times considering their recent actions in the House of withered blossoms and proximity to Kasai.

Touching the seal to the stone Shizuru once more after collecting the weapons causes the pit to close once more. With that bussiness concluded the Scions return to the courtyard to take inventory and address the now free Tos Kotun who has now morphed back into the more timid appearance of a young woman still caked in the viscera of her deceased abuser.

Shoko finding this to be distasteful removes the outer signs of battle with a wave of his hand.

"You have my thanks but never again without my permission." - Tos Kotun
"Good answer." -N
"I do not know if i will ever be able to repay you for what you have done but if there something within my power i will do my best to provide." -TK
"You don't have to repay us. It is what any decent person would have done." -Shoko
"How's Minkai? I've heard from that samurai i suppose but, it always this.. I don't know.... -- N
"-- some of us are new to these parts." - S
"Minkai is dying. The Jade regent has no connections with the other countries of Tian Xia and so trade has all but stopped coming through the borders. The other nations refused to accept theJade Regent as the ruler of Minkai so taxes are being raised across the country, many are losing their homes, their jobs and are turning the battery to survive." - TK
"What happened to you?" - S
"The Jade regent decided that my village no longer needed to exist and to wipe it from the annals of history. All the women were enslaved and the children and men killed. I was the gift from the local daimyo." - TK
She spits on the Corpse of Gangasan
"You've met the Daimyo?" - N
"Not personally. I know his name is Sikutsu Senaka." -TK
"Sorry if this to probing a question, Did he turn you into, well, what we saw back there, or where you always like that?" - S
"Have you always been able to turn into a fox? Oh wait you can't." - TK
"I like her." - N
"You're welcome to stay with us if you'd li---" - G
"Do you want to overthrow the government with us??" - O
"May I kill Senakka?" - TK
"I do not personally grant the license to kill that would be up to Lady Ameiko." - O

Ameiko gazes at Te No Sui Ponderously.

"Was slavery legal in this part of Minkai before?" - O
"A better question is will it be legal after we are finished." - N some what humurously.
"Absolutely not, and according to Minkaian law since you are directly wronged by Senakka the blow of his execution can fall to you legally if you wish it." - A
"They have weregilt here?" - N
"Samurai honor is not too different from it." - A
"So correct me if I am wrong but it sounds as if your Daimyo is not only aware of what is going on in this region but is letting it happen for monetary gain." - N
"He is a cruel and efficient and powerful, Daimyo anyone that gives voice to dissent in the province is ruthlessly persecuted If not outright killed, His guards have been given orders to execute anyone for sedition against the throne." - TK


And then no, i just goes up grabs, or would you buy the column is like, so what we're going to do here is that i need to be trained in inadutsu. You're gonna help me. And i'm gonna try and beat this idea out of your brain. Hold on, i have again.
Do you really want to practice swords though? Because like, we could practice, well, considering that it is apparently incredibly easy to identify what my skills are on site.
Hi. But one of those katanas myself and carry a dicho around just to make people get the wrong idea. I love living with incredibly wise, and high level ronin was able to look at you and see what you are. And now you just assume everyone can't. Yeah, you like take application is but it's like an inconvenience for the party. That's the problem. Oh, he absolutely made it sound like that. There's no what? I've yeah, that's the problem. It's not that he did. It's that he did in his first reaction was just, oh, fuck you. She's gonna carry around a die show, but instead of drawing or whatever, she's just gonna punch people through the chest.

57:50

Pull out their hearts. Do you know why i asked superintendent say here? Because someone got the wise idea to make it a lot more manageable and all of your swords way like i don't know, half a fucking country. It has enough.

Shoko turns to Grayson. 
"Let's give the place another once over make sure there are no surprises in case we need to defend this place." - S
After taking stock of the defenses and consulting with Noe and Ameiko they determine a method of trapping the secret entrance Noe used to infiltrate to slow down any possible ninja incursions with Koya's Magics.

As the caravan is moved in and preparations made to accomodate their now decent sized group Ochi takes the time to draw a large circle in the dirt just inside the gates and brings Noe over to work on her sword forms.

Shoko who is helping arrange things turns to Sandru who is directing much of the affair. 
"What's next for the Caravan?" - S
"I should probably go back to Varisia at some point. I mean you're in Minkai now do you really need the Caravan still." - Sandru
"Without your kind patronage where would a bird like me live?" - O ochi with a smirk
"You will always have room in my caravan Ochi but you are in the middle of a fight." - Sandru
"There's nothing keeping you here, If you want to get on with your life we won't ask you to fight this war for us." - S

Sandru turns his gaze to Ameiko who is busy watching Noe who has entered the circle with Ochi who is demonstrating the first stance of the sword forms and shakes his head.

"You don't really know me well enough to say that. I would not abandon her to this." - Sandru
"My apologies Sandru." - S nodding
"I have known Ameiko since she loved my younger brother before his death." - Sandru
"As long as everyone is on the same page i won't press anyone further and they are free to leave when they feel. We are at the point of no return." - S
"Are you just wandering around asking people if they want to jump ship?" - Sandru
"This is the last chance to do so." - S
"It just feels a little defeatist." - Sandru frowning quizzically
"Sandru my friend we are about to declare war. People should know what they're in for." - S
"I understand. But no i am not going anywhere." - Sandru Solemnly

Returning to the circle. Ochi has saved Noe the insult of treating her as a complete beginner and is demonstrating Kata with the goal of extending her current skills to utilize the longer reach and increased power of a full sized katana. they are side by side with Noe imitating Ochi's movements. Whenever correction is needed Ochi will have her move her foot or square her shoulder more. 

"It's been a few years." - N
"I have no doubt that you will take to it naturally but the basics are important." - O
"We'll see about that." - N
"I'm more concerned about what you will do once Ameiko is on the throne." - O

Noe freezes. 

"Would you like the optimistic answer or the actual one?" - N
"Just yours. I'm curious. I want.... I want to show my family what i've done." - O
"Oh yeah you are Minkaian aren't you." - N
"I'm very excited actually, I think they will be very proud of me." - O
"Hmm. Must be nice.... As for me... I'd like to stay, but, I have a thing I need to do first. I don't know how long that will take so..." - N
"That is good. It's good to have goals. That's why i ask. I'm not sure. i'm sure there will be some sort of place for me you know to be important and to do good works. But i don't know what will happen after." - O
"My brother in Tsukiyo you have recently been given the title of the lord of house Sugimoto." - N
"I am the son of a stablemaster from a fishing village. I don't know the first thing about being royalty." - O
"Well now you've got a bit more perspective on how she feels" amidst a puff of smoke from Wei Yan
"I sure do." - O
"Sorry to interrupt." - W
"Your input was welcome. I'm glad that you are here Wei yan." - O
"... So what's up with your rabbit friend. I still don't understand what that's all about. You should get a bird." - O
"I think all birds are obligated to hate me based on association with you." - N

Ochi Blinks

"However they are in good contention as I understand. As for the rabbit, the rabbit was a... hand... from one of your gods I assume. That is assuming Tsukiyo is included in your peoples god's I'm not really sure."
"All these mythical creatures serving the gods and I have Kentaro and a raven I stole from a bunch of viking Shinobi." - O
"I think you're looking at this the wrong way." - N

![[Ochi head tilt 1.jpg|400]]

"How should i look at it." - O
"The way you should probably look at it, if i'm honest, is that those of us that have had to be dropped proverbially in the correct direction have had help that you haven't needed, it is probably a token to how well you've managed to stay on your path, even if I do think it does backflips on occasion." - N

The whole time she is doing smooth downward swings with Te No Sui.

"I feel like you're telling me good job and that's how I'm choosing to take it. Thank you.." - O
"Good because you should." - N

"What." - N
"Nothing just move your feet a little closer together you are a little wide." - O
"It's hard to move the way I want with this." - N
"Things are different since your... return?" - O
"The Kami didn't exactly give me a manual. Adjusting has been... fun. Things are louder, things are brighter, lots of colors I didn't even know existed... really really deep oranges."
"That's very interesting. What does that roof over there look like to you?" - O

Ochi watches her squint and stare for a moment at the roof of one of the caravans. During this he notices that one of her eyes is a different color than the other and appears to be missing an iris. 

"I don't know. It's somewhere between like an indigo and a slate I guess." - N
"That's a very apt description of it actually are your eyes different?" - O
"What do you mean?" - N
"I don't think they were this color before. But I could be wrong. Has Ameiko noticed?" - O

And she had but it hasn't come up yet.

"Anyways do I hold my hands like this or like this for an upward swing?" - N
"There are two different techniques. We'll start with the more basic one, work on that one and that will be it for the day." - O showing her how to place her hand and demonstrating.

"You want to get just a couple of these basic moves down and then we'll move on to some fancier stuff you're doing really well though. This is not super different from the blades you're using currently. Just heavier and more cumbersome. You want to be able to take advantage of the better leverage you get out of the longer blade and the increased reach otherwise you might as well stick to the short blades. Good work Naoto. Let's see what Koya is cooking up." - O

"I've discovered water has a taste. That's a new thing and I hate it." - N

Upon return they discover Koya has made a shepherds pie sized for the entire caravan. Everyone enjoys the good food as well as mead and sake. After taking stock of the provisions of the fortress the spoils of the bandits proved to be extensive as far as food stuffs were concerned.

"This is why all the linnorm kings earned their throne through steel and blood. Once we go back I might become a linnorm king. We'll see how I feel." - K
"Won't we have to find a linnorm for you to kill first?" - G
"Sure." - G
"Actually that might no be a bad idea, Wait, does it have to be a linnorm or could it be something like some sort of foreign imperial dragon like here?" - G

1:26:07 ^

With the day winding to an end Jiro and Hatsue arrive at the head of their ronin band apparently victorious in battle against the outriders.

Noe gives clap at their arrival



i see you were successful. - Jiro


On a measure of success, aye N
Did you manage to open the vault? J 
Come join us by the fire. We'll tell you all about it. We did and we got your sword.

did you? J

 ShinobiAnd OG will pull it out of what i'm sure is the bag of holding and presented to it.

He kind of holds his hand out for a moments.

I will be honest. Well, i thought you capable of taking the fortress. I did not believe that you we're a true air of the imperial families. j
 
he removes the daikyo from his back,

This belonged to an imperial family, the higashiyama family, it is only right. It returns to the imperial family. - j

And he offers it in exchange for his family's katana uh trading it to you OG with reverence and respect. Oh, she does the same, he passes him, the sword. And he takes this really cool longbow. And then runs over really fast to grace him and answered and hands integration

Hold up there ochi. i don't i don't know if that's for me. g

And and why shouldn't it be grayson-san? o

Uh, don't i don't think, uh, lady make a really would want me as part of the families. 

We think of you as family, i'm just a birdman and now i'm the lord of the sigimadu. I've helped us immensely on this journey and i think you deserve it just as much as anyone of us. We're not asking you to rooming kai, just continue to do as you have done. - O

You could at least use it for now. It interests. You, it is a weapon and viewed with rail on our, it will hurt anamurumon - A

I could hold on to it for you. You will be, uh, the higashiyama lord in name and i'll just hold this bow for you, I guess.

Are you trying to steal my man kelda halfway up with her longsword half drawn. 

I've known him for approximately three days longer than you kelda watch the way you speak to me. - O

Is that a yes - K
No. It is not a yes, but i don't know. keep acting up and we'll see. - O
I will fight you. - K
I'll fight you too - O
then let's go. - K
Let's go, No, no weapons, okay? - O
No weapons. - K cracking her knuckles

Shoko grabs ochi by the collar and even with his noodle arms is able to carry him easily back to his seat. 

I seem to recall that my cousin wants nearly broke my wrist in an arm wrestling contest. - N

The ronin and their leaders all stare, eyebrows reaching the heavens, at these proceedings.

We thank you for bequeathing this to us, and we're most glad to be able to return your weapon to you. - O

You are a most interesting group - J

We get that a lot and i don't know why. So what's next and is there any way we can help the people before we move on? - O

My ronin are coming to occupy the fortress. - J


Safe and comfortable. We will begin repairing the damage. We were hoping to make it more defensible. We were we found it a little too easy to gain access. We would hate to be surprised. Maybe you have some thoughts and you can help us reinforce this place. - O

Yes, we will do this. - J

We know the Jade Regent is amassing troops to defend his claim to the jade throne in addition  The governor of kasai has been accused of treason leading many of the other nations of Tian Xia to cease trade with us - J

So we've heard = N

The new merchant caste of minkai different from the samurai caste and the civilian caste is centered in our western cities of akufuto and in enganoka and sakakabe to an extent. With the decline in the empire they are becoming restless. Many Daimyo are unhappy with the new bevy of taxes. The Jade Regent has purchased a foreign mercenary force known as the typhoon guard.

Shoko has never heard of the Typhoon Guard

I think stirring a rebellion here in the provinces of Enganoka Shinobi and Sakakabe merchant land is our most effective strategy but we will need more than my ragtag band of peasants and ronin.

First this freeing up the military from the Daimyo's control. Well, maybe not first. We would also benefit from winning the merchants to our side. There is also, of course,... the underground. It would be best to split this up into three objectives.

First, I would contact the ninja clans. While their aid may be distasteful to many imperial samurai, they will be useful to us. If nothing else getting them to remain neutral in the rebellion, would prevent them from being enemies once we tried to take Kasai.

How have the shinobi clans of Minkai generally responded to the Regent's rule? They generally followed him more somewhat remained distance from not from.

You guys talking, i can't hear you

i am not familiar with the ins and outs of shinobi politics, but that all three of the monkeys could be met upon the new moon. shoko asked when the new moon was and everyone was like yesterday. Uh, so you have a full month of time before the ninja can be gathered or you can go and see, whichever one of the representatives is there currently instead of seeing all three that is up to you.

Uh, the other people that we would need to speak with. Uh, enganoka which is 500 miles away. So at a 32 miles a day,

Yes. So by the time you get there you'll have like another 13 days till the new moon. So you could spend a couple of weeks in a big city if you wanted to where you could sell things.
After this, you will need to speak with the geisha.

You're gonna have to explain that one to me, the best way to get the support of the merchant is through the geisha of minkai. They know many secrets that can be used to manipulate the empire's, merchants and nobility. I would recommend the kinaro. Yo, my a tea house in sacabai.

01:51:31

It's like a bait, their entertainment district is second only to that of cosite. The owner of kiniro, the skill them respected, geisha named Okohaku and needs of the late governor of cosite and likely hates the jade region for killing her uncles.

01:51:58

That one should be an easy victory to bring to our side. Can we, can we have a map screen? I don't, i don't have a map currently in of the full thing. Hi, as i mentioned earlier, i did not get to do a lot of preparation for game because i could not look at a screen all week.

01:52:20

That's fair. But i can get a map of ring guide to put in discord and then you can just tell us like east west generally Ah, perfect. This one has everything on it. So, we need actually,

01:52:51

Boom. No, not in alphia, put it in jig region.

01:53:07

Moving.

01:53:21

Load, please.

01:53:40

Thank you. There we go.

01:53:52

So just so i can recap because i am trying to take some notes here, instead of go through my audio, it's 500 miles away is where we would talk to the ninja clans and it's in a month when they gather again because we just had the new moon. Yeah, so you are here right now.

01:54:14

Anganoka for the ninja claims are is here. The geisha are here. That's the best way to approach the geisha. As always is to letter them. I personally delivering an expensive gift to the tea house. Choko, you're up.

01:54:47

Zero. Kind of looks at you show, goes a ladies, fox, you know, he got that dog in him. I mean,

01:55:15

fortress [[Sainaru Heikiko]]
[[Hirobashi Jiro]]
emperor heron told us a shadow is following us
fought the bandits
opened the secret armory under the statue of [[Shizuru]]
found the [[Ancestral sword]] of the [[Hirobashi Jiro|Hirobashi]] family

7/15/23
[[Tos Kotun]] gave us information about the state of [[Minkai]]:
	Neighboring countries do not recognize the rule of the [[Jade Regent]] and so have refused to trade with [[Minkai]].
	The [[Jade Regent]] is ruling with an iron fist, wiping villages out entirely seemingly with abandon. Anyone who is deemed seditious is executed outright.
	The local Daimyo that gifted [[Tos Kotun]] to [[Gengasan]] is called [[Sikutsu Senaka]]
	[[Sikutsu Senaka]] is ruthless and efficient and the one who ordered her village to be wiped out.
	
we also learn she is a natural born lycanthrope
we ask her if she would like to join our little rebellion and she says yes after asking if she may be the one to kill [[Sikutsu Senaka]].

[[Koya Mvashti|Koya]] helps shore up the defenses of the fort with magic symbol traps
[[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] jokes about slavery
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] risks his life by talking while teaching [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] some katana moves
[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] asks [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] if her eyes are different so [[Ameiko Amatatsu|Ameiko]] and [[Naoto no Hatsuyuki|Noe]] decide to bring bdsm into the bedroom
[[Shoko]] and [[Sandru Vhiski|Sandru]] talk about what [[Sandru Vhiski|Sandru]] will do now that they've made the journey to [[Minkai]] and when [[Shoko]] suggests he can go home now [[Sandru Vhiski|Sandru]] says shut up old man

[[Hirobashi Jiro|Jiro]] and [[Hatsue]] arrive victorious over the outriders
he was not surprised that we were able to take the fortress but he was surprised to see us in possession of his [[Ancestral sword]] which proves us to be true heirs to the [[Five Imperial Families]].
after [[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] offers him the sword he gives us the [[Daikyo of commanding presence]] the ancestral weapon of the [[Higashiyama]] family in return.

[[Ochitsuite Arashi|Ochi]] tries to give it to [[Grayson]] and [[Kelda Oxgutter|Kelda]] accuses him of trying to steal her man.

[[The Ronin]] further elaborate on the state of [[Minkai]]
	The [[Governer]] of [[Kasai]] has been accused of treason which was probably one of the reasons the other nations aren't fucking with [[Minkai]] anymore


[[The Ronin]] outline all the steps to sensibly undermine the [[Jade Regent]] and take back the [[Jade Throne]]
	The [[Merchants]] of [[Akufuto]], [[Enganoka]] and to a lesser extent [[Sakakabe]] must be brought to empathize with the rebellion. Gaining the aid of the [[Geisha]] would be the most effective route to swaying them.
	The [[Daimyo]] still control the military forces of [[Minkai]] and winning the support of the common soldier to our cause will be easier than swaying each [[Daimyo]] individually especially since some are happy with the increased power.
	The [[Ninja Clan]]s [[Black Lotus]], [[Dragon Shadows]], and the [[Emerald Branch]] are all some where on the spectrum of neutral until they are paid to be otherwise and we should work to earn their aid or at least convince them to stay apathetic
	
The [[Jade Regent]] has purchased the aid of a foreign mercenary force known as the [[Typhoon Guard]] 
	
the daimyo 
left off meeting with the rep from the [[Dragon Shadows]] [[Hosukaiya Kazu]] 
paid him like 500g

Daikan tetsuku royal police
Noeâs sisterÂ  ambushed the party and beat ochi to death as well as koya before dying
evil coin made noe's sister do it
noe picked it up and it almost made her evil again too
then spirit koya cast atonement on her

noe's sister is [[tsubasa]]

two of the five storms are in kasai

The coin can only be destroyed by being eaten by a sovereign dragon (ancient?) 
harold is calling the dragon for us because going back to the caravan would take way too long with all the other things we're going to do try to do.

sovereign dragons are gingers
