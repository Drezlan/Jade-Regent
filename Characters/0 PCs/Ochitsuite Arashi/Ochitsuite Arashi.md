Born in Taeda in the Hiyosai province of Minkai, Ochitsuite Arashi was the younger of two sons. He faced discrimination rather quickly. When he was very young he would help his father in his work as a groom for the local lord and was wrongfully accused of stealing a saddlebag belonging to a visiting noble. A few years later bandits plague the village and the local lord calls for aid. Samurai are dispatched to Taeda. Ochitsuite sees the respect and admiration the people have for their saviors. He asks his father if he can be like that. His father tells him the truth, that no Minkain lord would accept the service of a Tengu because they are seen as untrustworthy. He still teaches Ochitsuite the blade.

Ochitsuite grows in his skill with a blade and the house guards comment on his progress and determination. The other children in the village grow jealous and make it a point to demonstrate how little his skill matters, ganging up to humble him.

Around this time His older brother Haruto begins cutting purses. After some time Haruto learns not to steal where he sleeps and travels to Hiyosai to make more money. His parents and Ochitsuite attempt to convince him to stop, but he believes he will bring them out of poverty and servitude with spoils from the pockets of the rich. He is quickly rounded up and forced into the service of a local crime lord who extorts increased levels of criminal activity out of Haruto. The heightened levels of crime are not directly linked back to Tengu in the area but they are suspected first.

Once Ochitsuite comes of age he attempts to swear his service to the local lord, He is refused. He leaves a note for his parents and takes ship, attempting to leave his dishonor and shame behind him. He is happily picked up by a captain who believes him to be good luck and is carried south and west to unknown lands. After many months and miles of bitter brooding on the waves Ochitsuite determines that he will prove his honor in these far away lands. Working his way as a hired blade he ends up in sandpoint guarding a caravan but thirsts for more.
