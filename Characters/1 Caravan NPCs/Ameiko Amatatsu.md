### One Page
Ameiko is a beautiful but somewhat irreverent woman of [[Tian-Min]] descent who runs [[Sandpoint]]’s [[Rusty Dragon]] tavern and happens to be a member of one of [[Sandpoint]]’s founding families. Her parents and older siblings have met unfortunate ends over the past several years, leaving the young woman as the sole remaining [[The Amatatsu|Kaijitsu]] in town. Ameiko may be among the town’s nobility, but she’s never really cared for the aristocracy—she’s always had an urge to explore, and loves hearing stories of adventures and daring deeds. She even spent a year or so as an adventurer herself, along with her friend [[Sandru Vhiski|Sandru]] Vhiski. Her short adventuring career earned her enough money to buy the [[Rusty Dragon]] outright, and she now serves as its sole proprietor in her “retirement.”

You get the feeling, though, that abandoning the adventuring life wasn’t entirely her choice—certainly she doesn’t talk much about what happened on her last adventure, or what happened to the others in her group though observant folks will often notice her touching or glancing at her tattoo when the subject is broached. And although she has a lot of friends and admirers in town, Ameiko has never accepted anyone as anything more than a friend; she dodges personal questions and diplomatically avoids proposals of romance, much to the frustration of several eager suitors here in Sandpoint. She’s a talented singer and samisen player, and if she wanted to, Ameiko could certainly lead a comfortable life here in [[Sandpoint]]. You know her fairly well, however, well enough to know that she is growing increasingly bored and impatient with having nothing more to look forward to than a “safe life” in a “safe town.” If the chance to go on an epic voyage or other grand adventure ever presents itself, you’re convinced that Ameiko would sell the [[Rusty Dragon]] and set out once more to seek her fortune in a heartbeat.

### Events:
#### Failed Reconciliation
 After a disastrous attempt to reconcile the bad blood between her [[half-brother]] and her father results in her brother striking her, Ameiko runs away from home shortly before the events of the “Late Unpleasantness” bring tragedy to [[Sandpoint]]. [[Atsuii Kaijitsu]] dies during these events of a mysterious fall from the sea cliff near her home.
#### Adventuring
**4705** Aged 16, Ameiko leaves home for the second time to take up life as an adventurer with several like-minded youths. Her adventuring career lasts just over a year.  
**4706** Rich from her adventuring success, Ameiko returns to [[Sandpoint]] to purchase an old tavern, “The [[Rusty Dragon]],” and scandalizes her father by becoming a bartender and tavern keeper.
#### Journey to the Throne
