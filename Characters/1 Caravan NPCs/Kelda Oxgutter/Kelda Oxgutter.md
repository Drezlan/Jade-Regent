Kelda was wounded but alive in the aftermath and was captured and transported to [[Brinewall Village|Brinewall]] by [[Corby]]s. There she was imprisoned and to be tortured and possibly eaten by [[Slugwort]]. The [[Amatatsu Scions|Scions]] happened upon her during their exploration of the keep and freed her. She asked to accompany them on her journey north to [[Places/Golarion/Inner Sea/Saga Lands/Land of the Linnorm Kings/Kalsgard/Kalsgard|Kalsgard]] that she might be returned to her family safely and assured them they would recieve a reward for aiding her. After Spending time with the group and because of the good company and Hospitality of [[Grayson]] she elected to continue on with [[Caravan|the Caravan]] and their quest.
