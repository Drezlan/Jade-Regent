Once free to wander [[Varisia]] like others of their kind the Lyrakien cleric came upon [[Brinewall Graveyard|the graveyard]] at [[Brinewall Village|Brinewall]] and, sensing the evil infesting the keep, took it upon themself to defend the sanctity of it and the shrine to [[Desna]] there. When the [[Caravan]]eers investigated [[Brinewall Village|Brinewall]] they encountered Spivey in their self appointed charge. Spivey aided them with information and asked if they would be vanquishing the evil in the keep. The party promised to do so so that Spivey could return to wandering and freedom. Once they finished with the keep they returned to Spivey with the good news and asked them to join the [[Caravan]]. Spivey agreed.
