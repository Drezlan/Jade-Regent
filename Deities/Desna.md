![[Desna.png|left|345]] 
[[Desna]] was one of the first dieties and she built the heavens. She and her followers delight in exploring the world. The goddess of freedom and luck worshipped around the world. She is described as a beautiful elven woman with butterfly wings containing all of the beauty of the night sky. [[Desna]] is opposed to the mother of monsters [[Lamashtu]] for the murder of her mentor and to reclaim the domain of beasts as well as [[Rovagug]] and [[Zon-Kuthon]] for control of the night. [[Cayden Cailean]] is known to be a suitor of hers but she remains aloof prefering a polyamorous relationship with [[Sarenrae]] and [[Shelyn]].

Desnans, when they do, recieve her wishes through dreams, images, feelings, or even prophecies that remain in the recipients mind after waking. If there is no time for a dream then she has sent swarms of butterflies, dragonflies, or sparrows. When displeased she will make sleep fitful or withold it or making walking unbearable.

Her faithful hold creatures that symbolize freedom and the night sky as holy. Butterflies have taken the foremost place among these. A swarm of butterlfies is seen as a  sign of [[Desna]]'s favor.

Once a clan of tundra nomads called the [[Uqtaal]] worshipped [[Desna]] as the Queen of the North Star at [[The Crown of the World]]. Believing the lady protected them during the long arctic night. They believed that when they died their souls would travel to the north star to join her. They bult the [[Uqtall Necropolis]] at the base of the [[Wall of Heaven]] and the [[Path of Spirits]] that lead souls through to the [[High Ice]] and on to the north pole, Guided by the north star where [[Desna]] would find them and guide their soul to it's resting place in the stars. Sadly the clans were corrupted into worship of [[Fumeiyoshi]] and forsook [[Desna]].
