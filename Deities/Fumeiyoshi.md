The [[Fumeiyoshi|Lord of Envy]] was once the god of night but he grew so jealous of his brother [[Tsukiyo]]'s relationship with [[Shizuru]] that he murdered [[Tsukiyo]]. After [[Shizuru]] recruited [[Qi-Zhong]] to resurrect [[Tsukiyo]] she also enlisted [[Yaezhing]] to banish [[Fumeiyoshi]] to his brother's tomb and stripped him of his position, forever damned to envy his betters as the undead envy the living.

Now considered the patron of undead and [[Oni]] his is the lord of dishonor, envy, graves, and undeath.
