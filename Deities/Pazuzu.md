[[Pazuzu]] is the self styled [[Pazuzu|King of the Wind]] and Demons, few dispute it. Once lover of [[Lamashtu]] he is covetous of her position as a goddess and seeks her dominion over the beasts. Rather than work his evil through intermediaries [[Pazuzu]] is fond of acting on his own behalf on the [[Material Plane]] through possession. Some say that just invoking his name is enough to invite his unfriendly attention. His hand can be seen through many terrible events on [[Golarion]] large and small.
