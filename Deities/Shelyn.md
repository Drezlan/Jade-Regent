The patron of art, beauty, love and music, [[Shelyn]] is half-sister to [[Zon-Kuthon]]. Starting as a minor god of these things the destruction of her mother, the former goddes of love, bequeathed these domains unto her. For a time she shared these aspects with her brother but at some point they argued and he left [[Golarion]] for the dark places between the planes. When her returned he had become [[Zon-Kuthon]]. When their father [[Thron]] the wolf spirit tried to welcome him home [[Zon-Kuthon]] captured and tortured him. For these crimes and other terrible acts against [[Shelyn]] and her works the gods of golarion banished him to the [[Shadow Plane]] for as long as the sun hung in the sky. [[Shelyn]] attempted to redeem her brother and stole his weapon the [[Whisperer of Souls]] but was unable to return him to the way he was before. She kept the weapon out of love for the brother she lost.

[[Shelyn]] exists as a beauty unparalled inside and out. Those who look upon her see their vision of perfect beauty. She is almost always a young wonman with silver or blue eyes and chestnut hair to her ankles containing strands of bright colors throughout.

Before her acension to [[Shelyn|Goddess of Love]] [[Shelyn]] was flighty and shallow. After seeing love expressed for the unbeautiful she now looks for beauty in everyone and everything. 

>"Beauty comes from within" 

is a saying she introduced to [[Golarion]] and requires the notion of her clerics and worshipers.
