Shizuru is the Tian-Min goddess of the sun, honor, ancestors, and swordplay. As she holds swordplay in her portfolio, Shizuru is also the patron of samurai and other noble and honourable swordsmen and women. Lover to [[Tsukiyo]], enemy of [[Fumeyoshi]], and sister to [[General Susumu]].

Her relationship with The Prince of the Moon is difficult as they can very rarely meet as the sun and moon except for times of eclipse.

She claims domion over the other gods of [[Tian Xia]] but does not press the issue and in turn they acknowledge her as their leader. As long as she does not interfere in their affairs the others obey her edicts, Including those with nefarious intent. Foreign gods are not treated this way however. Only civilized dieties are treated as other heads of state, not evil ones.

Her followers strive to lead virtuous lives and inspire others to do the same. The teaching also includes respecting your elders and honor is swordplay. Despite this Shizurans do not seek battle but pray for peaceful times.
