The [[Tsukiyo|Prince of the Moon]] is both brother to [[Fumeiyoshi]], who murdered him, and lover to [[Shizuru]] who had him resurrected. During his internment in his tomb a rat feasted on his corpse absorbing some of his diving power and became [[Lao Shu po]] usurping [[Fumeiyoshi]]'s place as god of the night in his absence and patron to rats and theives. The first stones of jade were said to be formed from the intermingling of [[Shizuru]]'s tears with [[Tsukiyo]]'s blood as she wept over his corpse.
