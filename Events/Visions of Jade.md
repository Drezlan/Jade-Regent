Visions of Jade

*An [[Oni]] army with burning skin, glaring eyes, and sharp tusks, wearing strange armor and wielding exotic weaponsâ€”emerge in a storm from a vast forest, then descend upon [[Minkai]]. This vision is swiftly followed by another: [[Emperor Shigure]] dressed in royal robes stands over a simple well, a friend at his side. Suddenly, the friend grows nearly three times in size and is sheathed in a frightening suit of jade armor. The [[Jade Warrior]] draws a sword and strikes down his royal friend, then holds the bloody sword aloft in triumph. A third vision follows, this time of [[Tsutoku Amatatsu]] a.k.a. [[Rokuro Kaijitsu]], [[Ameiko]]'s grandfather, handing the legendary sentient sword [[Te No Sui]] to a richly dressed [[Ulfen]] man, [[Fynn Snaevald]], in exchange for a bag of gold to fund his families flight. Finally, this vision fades, and we see [[Ameiko Amatatsu]] waking from [[Ameiko's Possesion]] as the [[Kami]] possesing her flys back into the seal, but she is dressed in the finery of an empress. She rises from sleep not in [[The Caravan]], but from a resting spot within the arms of a jade throne.*
