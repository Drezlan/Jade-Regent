Visions of Jade
The Amatatsu Seal is a potent artifact, one capable of altering
destiny and changing the course of nations. When the PCs
first open the warding box that contains it, the Amatatsu
Seal immediately marks each character as an agent of the
family, turning them into Amatatsu scions, as detailed on
page 60. In addition, the PCs momentarily black out and
experience a rapid series of visions.
In the visions, the PCs see an army of terrible fiends—with
burning skin, glaring eyes, and sharp tusks, wearing strange
armor and wielding exotic weapons—emerge in a storm
from a vast forest, then descend upon a nation populated
by Tian people. This vision is swiftly followed by another: a
young man dressed in royal robes stands over a simple well,
a friend at his side. Suddenly, the friend grows nearly three
times in size and is sheathed in a frightening suit of jade
armor. The jade warrior draws a sword and strikes down his
royal friend, then holds the bloody sword aloft in triumph. A
third vision follows, this time of a young Tian man handing
a beautiful sword to a richly dressed Ulfen man in exchange
for a bag of gold. Finally, this vision fades, and the PCs see
their friend Ameiko waking from her deep sleep, but she
is dressed in the finery of an empress. She rises from sleep
not in a humble Varisian caravan, but from a resting spot
within the arms of a jade throne.
These visions pass in the span of a few heartbeats, and
after they do, they impart knowledge to the PCs’ minds.
The PCs know that the land they saw invaded by fiends
was Minkai, that the man they saw murdered by the jade
warrior was Emperor Shigure of Minkai. They know that
Ameiko Kaijitsu’s true family name is Amatatsu, one of the
five royal families of Minkai—indeed, the last surviving
royal family. The PCs recognize the young Tian man
with the sword as Ameiko’s grandfather, Rokuro Kaijitsu,
formerly Amatatsu Tsutoku, selling the family’s legendary
sword Suishen to the Ulfen merchant Fynn Snaevald in the
city of Kalsgard to finance his family’s f light and exile.
They also know that Suishen is intelligent, and can impart
much more knowledge of the Amatatsu family’s legacy if
recovered. Further, they know that Ameiko herself is the
heir of her line. Finally, the PCs know all of the powers and
abilities of both the Amatatsu Seal and its warding box—
including the danger of leaving the warding box open,
which would allow the oni of the Five Storms to once more
track the Amatatsu Seal.
Back at the caravan, Ameiko experiences these same
visions, and as they pass, she wakes with a gasp as the kami
possessing her returns in a f lash back to the Amatatsu Seal.
