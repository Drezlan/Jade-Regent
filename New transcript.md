Use me if you want. I can do a recap. I would love it if you did Grace and recap, let's hear it. So last session we started in the in after having her conversation, there the night before or the afternoon before, whatever. And then we had to go. We had a decide, which in we were in, and, as in which quarter of the city after deciding that we had a bunch of back and forth about where the next destination we should go was between the two options.

One being the Rheim Runner's Guild and the other being Was it Ravens crag, Ravens crack, something like that. And Noah wanted to go scout out the Rheim Runners Guild while we the rest of us rested there was talk of back and forth about oh should somebody come with her?

Do we like and it seems like more and more people were jumping on the the wagon of coming with her and Choco looked at us all like no you guys are stupid. I need my spell slots and eventually we're like, all right, we're just gonna go to bed and then know I went on her own and I think was able to get in through a window if I remember, right?

And kind of searched around a little bit, I think it. I don't know if it was on like the first or second floor or aware of it somewhere and manage to avoid some guards. Managed to find a hidden trapdoor in. I think it was like a supply closet which led down to like a small little secret room that she that had a chest.

She was able to get into the chest and got some papers I believe it was that we're incriminating of, was it? The it was that the raimer's Guild was purchased from snoring a while ago that it clearly was like a front for the frozen shadows now I believe. And oh, and that they have, they were the ones to pay that other guy to rent the boat and come attack us and go get that sword.

The, the katana, the incessiona. Yeah. And so then I she came back, we finished our rest went in the morning. We Then went and everybody except no way went in the front door of the Rheim Runner's Guild to the attendant there. While no way camped out on I think like a nearby roof and we asked to see their boss.

I'm blinking on her name right now even though we just fought her and the attendant was actually like, sure. Yeah. You can come talk to her after, you know, after you confirm it with her and so like, huh. Alright, so they let us back in there. She's behind the desk.

There is some discussion. So, I think some threats on our end towards her, like blackmailing, and eventually she decided. Now, there were gonna gonna ambush you guys. Now turns out she's a Oni ocher, I think it was and then no is Master showed up as well. And at one point in the battle shoka, almost died.

Another point Zeo almost died and eventually, no, it was able to get in and help and there was a bunch of back and forth and a bunch of people were able or no not much the master and the ogre were able to see near see her while she was invisible.

We were able to take her master out but then After finishing off the rest of the guards, the the boss ogre. One yogurt lady threatened. That hey, if you don't let me leave. You're never gonna see your friends alive probably. And so we're we let her go she flew off, remember, right?

And we searched a bunch of bodies and I think that's right where we had left. That is all super correct. That was a really, really good recap. I want to throw in some names and correct one thing. So the correction is that they did not buy the rhyme Runner's.

Guild from Snorri, they bought ravens Crag from Sonori several years ago, which lines up with Helgeval's like until that he gathered because he's been camping out on them. The timeline of them buying that and kind of being active is the same and what they did by was Raven's Crag, not the rhyme Runner skilled.

And Kim and Dotsu is the only ogre and her alias in her human form that she was using to act as the head of the rhymearner's Guild is Thorborg Silver Score but that was perfect. That was really awesome.

And I think we have everybody dead or dying on the ground including Omiyani and that's where we have left off Omiani, I believe was executed by Noah. Yep. You did. I don't have that. Yeah, that's fair though because that's like, oh I'm gonna help her and, you know, it comes over puts slow down and stomps on it to break her napkins.

Like no I had it where you were like holding a sword to her chest in case she got up and tried to run again. But, you know, if you just do a quick little stabby stab, there's not a lot I can do about that. He did not want to risk her former master waking and escaping much.

Yeah. The The general rule of thumb is that if you fail you should probably pay the price for it and we're not having a rerun of a mistakenly intruding on. What is otherwise a appropriate way to die? I'm not repeating. Hell That? Yeah, I have a lot of questions for her.

Oh dear.

Do you think any of these guards are gonna know anything?

Darts. No. Yeah, no. It gives you like a wavy behind the shift to go. I'm going to take it on face that they probably didn't even know that their boss was. Well, my boss, I've been tell more than likely. They were legitimately hired guards with a paper trail. Yeah, exactly.

Yeah, I wanted to confirm that a mako's still alive. We've been operating under that assumption but it's very much a point of stress for me. I don't doubt that but counterpoint So now I was gonna like go over to away on his body and just just out of contact that she happened to have one of those Blood, mockings blood.

Yes, that's the one actually think. Oh, my honey does, but let me tell check.

Let me know. It would be genuinely surprised if she doesn't but Ochi would be. There's a 50/50 on that one but he was kind of hoping like the slightly higher up people, maybe didn't have that and we could get some information. Actually, she does not bear a blood guys.

Seems a bit weak. But Well maybe she could have said something to you but frankly I don't know how much of it would have been useful unless you have ways of detecting people who can lie. I don't they also no reason for here to have one. She's very loyal.

Yeah, but that's also like that's like saying secret agents don't carry cyanide in case of you know, I mean, she has black lotus extract and realized. As I said this, please. Well, is everyone? Okay. Shoko, you took quite a beating. How are you feeling? Oh, like I just spent a night in the single worst bar and got.

Where are we? Again, I thought about that about that bad Probably you're still alive. So, if I may offer a personal insight, I'd say, you haven't been to the worst bar in Kalsguard Also, you took earth taker directly to the face and survived. So I am genuinely there. Yeah, that's Choco.

Do you have any, Oh, you have anything to heal yourself or can Koya? Heal you some more. Am I healed up? I forget if I got healed up. You have like three quarters to give you a heel before but she can give you another one. We can save you.

I have some potions that he can drink right now. Yeah, we've got quite a few potions to three years. Yeah, I don't want to play a burning up. All her spell slots before we go get meditated. Yeah, I'll give you a cure lighter too, if you want them, because that's all I know.

Yeah, I would probably need like two of them, maybe even three. How do you give someone an item or can he just look it up and use it and I'll take it. I mean, the heel was probably better like to be. To be honest will be quiet. These we can do right now because we're out of combat.

The heels. She can do in combat. That was my reasoning, but it's up to you. It's your okay. All right. Yeah. Okay. Okay, though. The best way to give someone an item is to go to your inventory tab. Yep. And there's a little split item and a little gifty box.

Gotcha, split them off and then give them to shoko. Yeah, block. However, many you want to give him and then pass them to him.

Now, my list of who I can give to is much larger than all of yours, so but you should be able to give to most of the party and your NPC friends. Yeah. I ran you two of them drinks to test tube shots, just too shell.

Okay, sorry about that. Welcome, welcome.

Toes. Those horrible, yeah.

It brings me up to just shy of Volvo. Excellent. And so you already gave us the loot that we would have found by checking the bodies. It is in the discord chat, just wanted to make sure that we got all of them. That was, that included on Miyani. And not just the guards, I guess I was actually about to draw your attention to Omani's here.

Including deadly, kiss. The shizaku of the night wind. It goes ago. Dozo, who I was like wind her earthfire Shurikens.

Don't potions of Shield of Faith. She actually has really good gear.

Though did the fighters for that matter.

Yes, them in there. Great swords.

And you mentioned a name. I want to bring this up I don't know if we do know this. I have question mark question mark, question mark right here. When Kim and Dotsu takes off and starts flying. She you said someone's name or she said someone's name that goes with her and I didn't catch what it was.

I don't know if I wasn't know that name roads the blood feather raven was waiting out out the door. That's what I thought. I thought I didn't like it didn't come through in the transcript. I couldn't hear it in the audio wounds like toads with a W.

Ah,

How about that? The other sticks guards that we're upstairs again thigh.

Everything that you have not killed, the other people in their company and I assume we're not making any threatening moves towards them. Nope, not me. No, I don't see what we would lightly. Leave to find new employment. Good morning, goodbye.

Wait, do we want to hire them to? He ran away. He ran away. Do you really want someone who's going to run away? The first sign of a massive violence, that's fair. But we do have a habit of picking up people who used to work for those that we just fought and bringing them with us.

What? I know, terrifies me. No way. Yeah, that's never gonna invite you in the ass. We did that. Once to be fair, I wouldn't call it quite a habit yet. No. No, we have the Olfen Raiders and we have no A

She puts up like a single finger, to be fair, though You didn't exactly know that until fairly recently and you haven't kicked me out yet. So, I can only assume that you're either putting up with me or plotting to have me thrown in the river by the end of the evening, but I'm hoping for the first one.

You're insider knowledge has been absolutely invaluable. No way. That's all I'm saying. It has to be. If I don't tell you, I'm gonna die with it Anyways.

Well, we have no one to ask any questions of and I think we know where we're headed. Not unless you know how to talk to the dead. I'm afraid.

We are we certain that Ushaka's not here. That is an excellent point, Grace. And perhaps we should take a look around. Yeah, we should, we should check the building. Did we have any kind of inkling from when you were here before that uchaka might be here. No way, if I had thought as much, I would have probably tried to have gotten her out.

We should probably have heard about it well before now we should probably still take a look around. So can we Should we WASD our way around the building? Or can we just roll a search on it because the guards left? I'm you know kind of like oh the remaining clerk, who is not flood yet, tells you that Ushaka is in this room here.

The one with the boarded up in Bard windows. Oh, the poor lass. Yeah, yeah. That's why we don't take no way out her word. Hey, but you did say that you don't think she would be here. No way. Doesn't even try to defend herself. She's just like hey well make way.

Let's go for your continues like pointing a finger at you as she walks away. Let me.

Your story.

But neatest the cook tree of desk, if he's mundane records, nothing of importance. You've already gotten those documents from the secret room. Meeting room, I guess chambers, where Shaka is quote-unquote? Guest chambers. Well, when they're not being used for prisoners, they can be rented for five gold pieces of the night expensive.

They're very secure rooms. This is the part where we take a hard left and start running a bend breakfast out of here. If man, could you imagine? Ochi crows every single morning that is literally the only things here, which is what really tells you that this place was a front.

There's there's no extra coinage. There's nothing of actual import for business half. The reason why noise like didn't have kept her here, why would they have done that? They've got nothing about Jewishaka. I could be that they just hadn't gotten a chance to take over the other place yet.

Just, they just grabbed her yesterday that I can believe.

Well, Zero tries to fix what is our Bluetooth speaker?

Come out, come out wherever you are. Shaka. It's right here. You found her in that room bound up and gagged.

We've been looking everywhere for you. Mmm. Oh, gee, will notice that she's gagged and bound and untie her and on gag her Is there cool? Character art baboon or rook shaka? Yeah, it's okay. Character art, it's pretty cool. She got cool stick. He does have a cool stick.

You have my. Thanks for bringing me. No, thanks necessary. We desperately need your help.

Have you found any news of olf? We found zero trace of news of Wolf and we've looked quite a few places dangerous ones at that. Are you? Well, Did they harm you? Not be on the beating? They gave me to steal me. We have many strange large bird men.

Strange. How Well to be fair. They all looked like you, but they were all wearing these black pajamas. Please don't call them pajamas. Those are in fashioned lately. I've seen I'll have to get some as Grayson and Noah are both wearing black pajamas right now too. She'll go says under his breath.

I'm sorry, I didn't Oh many years. You need to study before you actually earn a Shazoku, right? About social actually probably wouldn't know that.

Yeah. But no way things you don't well, Shaka I'm not sure how much, you know, but from things we found here and various other interactions with our pajama friends, We believe that they're holding our friend and olf Raven's Crag.

Hmm, I know the way I could show it to you. You'd take us there. We could use your help If they have captured oath. Of course, well then I think it settled. I think we should make our way there. Maybe do some reconnaissance again. These are very very dangerous enemies.

We're facing.

How, how long is the trip there? Just a good a couple hours or you know what, let me see if they tell me, I want to say, it was like 20 miles north was said at one point but I could be making that up. It's quite fraven's. Craig lives.

Two days walks, excuse me. South of callsgard not north. Heck, you lied Go back and kill her again. I thought I won't Once it's location is known the journey to Ravens crack can be made in one day on horseback or two days on foot. This is real passes through a buggy terrain.

Salvocals calls guard dotted with small copses and shale hillocks Hilux. The grade line of craggy hills is visible to the south and beyond them. The green forest In addition to? Nope, that's for me. Not you Also other features Probably.

Shall we go for a day ride or whatever time of day? It is now, right? Well, it seemed like if we are if we go there wouldn't make a whole lot of sense to come back without finishing up there. So is there anybody else we want to bring with us?

Yeah, everybody. The whole caravan.

I think Ushaka might be handy, considering we're striking out into the wilderness. A guide might help especially she knows of any places. We can find that are hidden away so that we might be able to camp out for the night before we make our soul. Yeah, I agree. I think we want to take as much forces we can, but those who are inconspicuous only, we don't want to be caught out in the open.

Does anyone need anything before we go? This is likely your best opportunity to shop unhindered since more than likely. All of the frozen shadows have pulled back into Ravens Crag. Now.

No, I would know that if they're preparing for an assault, I mean the fact that cannot do was here tells me that either though of particularly overconfident in clearing us out or they thought the reload the client. Hold on, right. So it's given me a lot of trouble here, like, I pressed save on my custom dice and the entire system is just broken for me.

Hmm. I have bird feathered dice. All right. May apologize for being a final for so long. What I miss Were you able to hear at least? Do you have to be? No, because I would try to meet everything. So I could try and get that. Get the sound thing, figured out, that's cool.

The short version here is up dial. If you draw a line from you to OG over on this, other side of OG is Upchaka, who was tied up and gagged in the boarded up room in the back. And that's basically it. We don't know anything necessarily new over what we do before.

Just that everybody Amiko and Olaf are probably in Ravenscrag and the frozen shadows of all pulled back to Ravens. Craig. Like we just So gather everything you need. We we assault Ravens crack.

Well Ochi and show code, two of you feel confident in the front line or do we need to go get you know someone else. If it's for Amico then I will fight. I didn't mean like show. Don't you are really well fight more. Like are you willing to take the hits?

I didn't hear Kelda, We never really think Kelda would probably be upset if we didn't bring her? Yeah.

I want to address that actually because what where Kelda asked us to escort her back to was that here in calls guard or was it somewhere like further north? Because Nope, it's here. So as we've never really like, RPed that out is like we we were supposed to bring her here and get a reward and we haven't talked about that at all.

So she just like you know what, these guys are pretty cool. This dwarf, dude. He knows how to party. And she's just like, oh yeah, with these guys, she did give us her reward. She gave us a sheath. I think it was covered of vigor. Yeah, so I don't have that anywhere.

I miss that whole thing. Yeah, you guys let me hold on to it, which I mean, it's oh, she wants instead. I'll give it to you. No, no, I remember the discussion about this gavard. I just don't have that anywhere in my notes or remember how? That's how that came up.

So yeah, I just wanted to like, we're just kidnapping Helda after break. Bring your ear here. You're coming with us. We need you. Hey guys, stand in front of everyone. We're gonna go and single file. You're gonna take all the arrows on the way up. Elda is not normally a continuing presence.

In Jade regions. But if you guys want to talk her into going with you, you can just knock on our door. Let's go. We're going to Kelda's house. We're gonna knock on our door. Can Kelda come hang out with us. I get the distinct impression of knowing knocked on her door.

Like like someone related to kill the open. Oh, but just get slammed immediately Just like, nope. But yeah, no, that's a good point. If not killed. It would be. What Sandro? Yeah, pretty decent agility tank. I think we can use all the all the blades we can get our hands on.

Well we don't want to bring the entire extended cast. Every time we go somewhere, do we? Oh no, advising on premise As a prayer. I would not advise it on premise at the DM, please God don't. There's no way Do you know. So, by It's a very different, the question.

Yeah, Speaking of says Noah is she like pockets, every vile but Omanihad and put her hand into her into her bag of many things apparently and was out the shortsword that she's previously been using and hasn't now for a little while. It's like, well, I'm gonna go see him on about getting this turned into a bunch of gold and hopefully right back.

It's Yeah, I don't want to be riddled with both it. I didn't want to bring everyone. If we want to bring someone like, if we think we should bring Kelda or Sandru, I think we should bring one if we're gonna bring one because last time, we had that whole debacle about trying to go into the acidic long fuse long house where they were partying, we had like 10 people deep and we couldn't even like get through the door to fight everyone because we had so many people.

Yep.

About the question would be uchaka. You I know you would help us get there. But are you Are you much of a fighter? Mmm, I have learned many of the Northern ways of How do they stated sword and Board, ah, stick and board. I am very fun of the lungsword.

I think that's all the help that we should need.

I think we want to strike fast and hard with a small group, This place will be well defended. And if we try and stand and fight them, we're going to be vastly outnumbered and outgunned.

And then we do oceans, whatever. Number like montage planning. This this rescue like Fast and the Furious.

You.

Oh, shopping. Chuck already did all of this shopping on the way here. And checking I'm guessing no ways taking all the poison that we just looted, Unless, you know, someone who can you can sell off. Seven grand worth of poison tape. And then, are you taking the show? Zoku of the night wind.

No, I just thought I'd leave it there. And yeah, Yeah. I and what about the dagger? What does it do? It's a named one. That's not. Yeah, definitely. Kiss. What do you do?

A short action, you can manually apply poison to the blade without kinds of expertise me. So it's poison. Oh action. Poison application. That is actually super useful.

I mean, platonically speaking. I don't see why you like daggers aren't really my thing but sentimental value and also it's very good for assassinations you could rather make you money.

Well, which is it you taking it or not? It rolls arise and takes it sign. And these shuriken. Oh hell no I can't. Fire those to save my fucking life. Let me look at that. So let me look at the earth fire. Jerry can real quick. I might take them is a plus one flaming Birth Shuriken.

We have three of them.

Hmm. Could I use these? Sure, can our monk weapon, right? It can be. Yeah.

Plus we do have proficiency monk weapons. It's a DC-15 reflex or you catch fire.

So that's pretty cool. If you want to showco, you can totally take them. I have some and I don't plan to use them often not the earth fire ones. Just some some generics. Oh yeah, sure. Some, some occasional range option would be nice. Yeah, we have, I mean, obviously Grayson is like a gallon gun over here of flurry of bows, but other than that, you and blurry a bows, he's just throwing bows with every flurry attack.

Yeah, showtimes. Doing or better doing damage from range, then the rest of us the rest. Here's three of them then. Well, as far as loot, we basically have nothing. Now, since that we just took 30,000 in loot on her own.

No, he isn't here for this conversation. She's off selling the dagger immediately. You're you're joking. But that's actually, what's happening. Like that tiger is is nice genuinely. Now I just would be more interested in getting it broken down for parts and selling it rather than selling there's a whole night.

Interdesting, We'll get you the big stick from Kim and Dotsu. Grayson, you can have the, the beater

So yeah, how much is that? I think it's 5,000 something for delicacas's sale. I'm just checking the value. He line back down here. You definitely kiss was 10,300 and two gold. So 5,151. Yeah, that's correct. Yeah.

Sorted. But this is ocher though. I'm sorry. That is mm-hmm. Yeah, that's your. That's your for the rest of the game. You'll never take that off. They literally put that in for anyone that wanted to play a ninja ninja.

You know, that meme of the guy that goes. Yes, I'll die then. Like that's, that's the face. I'm pulling. Looking at that item. I'm like, I don't know what you want me to say Another thing. But what the order lady have honor, you don't get her here quite a lot of spite.

He's arrived. We're gonna have to work a little harder to find out. Right. Yeah, she left with zero damage on her actually. Not saying that she wasn't hit but she was perfectly fine when she left.

Alright, let me since you are selling stuff, I will drop the cows guard selling stats and chat again. That is what is currently available for purchase?

Took old be perfect. How do I add a weapons from my inventory into the combat tab? If you go into the details tab,

And open up. Oh yeah. Where's your star knife? Oh no. Clear. Start knife has missing. If you go into the details tab, you'll see the create a tack down under weapon details.

Um, Okay, I'm dumb. Where is the details tab? Or the item or the tab itself, I guess. For either you have you clicked on edit item on the weapon? Okay, edit item. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. You because you guys gave clear that plus one returning star knives, didn't you?

Here I'm feeling like probably I don't see why we would have kept that. When we know somebody who has a thing, um, shocks are night. I love that. One's the one that turns in the lightning bolt spark weight knife.

Okay, so once Noah goes and basically blitzes down more than half of of what I personally was keeping on retainer 6,151 gold pieces. Do what you want with it.

So you saying must No, that's collectively. If I had that together, I'd be asking, like myself. What the fuck was I doing with all this money? No, that is from selling some off pieces. Oh, and then the 278 is from, what was left on the loot list? Grayson. Yep.

You can find defense for the the black market items in jade quarter. Oh we can. Um then when Noah's done like making antitoxins for those poisons that we have on hand so long, it's just got enough to be able to make the anti-toxins with the rest. We can get sold.

Wouldn't So my shuriken are using my strength to attack? I don't think that's correct. Is it there? He's throwing weapon. You change it? Let me just. No, maybe use your strengths. What?

Oh, well, these are useless to me, then. Yeah, we could probably just sell those to. I have no idea. They went off the strength Only for damage. They still use extra throwing for your attack role. Eggs strength or damage. Okay. For so for attack role, it should be next for attack roll on this.

It's a string just switch it to X. Oh, I'm looking for the ability to do that. I like I'm looking under details. I see attack. Type weapon attack. Natural. Attack, class ability. I'm not saying oh held, I could select which hand it's held in, I put down monk and thrown in weapons group, that didn't change anything.

Okay, so you're still on that tab, scroll? All the way back up to the top. Where it says action, see where it says tech. So while they're discussing at that, what was that total again that we were gonna divide for the deadly kiss? I'm I'm reading it because the number is much higher if I can actually get rid of this poison, okay, once you have the edit item for your attack, open go over to action.

Okay. Now I say, okay. All right, all right.

They're also slamming burst but that doesn't seem to be and damage formula.

26 fire.

On a great 1d and fire.

Um, I'm sorry to be the fucking problem. Child here, I changed action type to range weapon attack and it's not changing it. You can still change it manually to Dex and strength.

Boop. Okay. And delete the old attack you made and create a new one Ebola. Thank you. And I'm sorry, I should know this system better by now. So, every time you make an attack on your combat page, it becomes a separate entity from your inventory page. So if the base item changes, you modify it in your inventory, then create a new attack with it, okay?

Stuff up. And,

And, and hardball.

Monday night himself or half value too. I've never sold anything before, Right? Okay, cool.

How do you guys feel about the anti-toxins?

Poison sock. Oh yeah, it does sound like a good idea.

I'm just saying that if I were An injure in the employee of a clan called the Frozen Shadows. I had myself a little place up on the balcony of some cliffside. I'd probably trap it with an image of his license poison that we go into that. I could get my hand on.

Hypothetically speaking and of course,

And,

Ah, no wrong wand.

Okay, if you want to just decides to inflict wounds on zero out of nowhere, you know?

Is anyone in this group good at um ferritting out traps like that?

Doesn't go acts the group but he looks at no way he does. She have trap finding of what, why do you think I would have Trump finding? That seems like a completely. Ridiculous question. Why would I actively anybody can find transfer that magical trap. You need trap finding And you travel that you see over 20.

So I want to get back to this selling the stuff that no ways doing because I'm confused by it. 21 351. Okay, you just typed it. How about that? So we're all agreement about the the poisons we want to make anti-toxins so we don't die. I think the only one that probably doesn't need them as Grayson which is, I didn't think it was a frink of nature as we've established.

He just drinks it for breakfast. In fact, cursing, can you can you come over here? A minute. I'm gonna fix some of your blood and use it as a basis. No, it So work blood is a basis for is there. Action is the two gonna do? It is the 250 coming off of the 10?

Gonna prevent you do that? No, thanks. Now that's the. That's the that's the actual, like, full with the top antitoxin values. That's all that. That's That's the final value that you guys can go shopping with do what? Okay, so we're splitting the 10. 550 0.5.

Come on. It's just a little nick.

And flex maybe but I found I don't know if I could trust your words. So, Oh, I would recently give the smartest person here, but you're also the one. That's a complete freak of nature. And frankly, I think it's rather fascinating that you're able to resist so many toxins.

So well, So I'm out. Just for the benefit of everyone including Amico in front mid, I'm pretty sure it wasn't even poisoned. It was just a terrible tea, Grayson give the scary ninja lady your blood. It's for everyone. It's for all night. I mean there's a non-zero chance that they might have also used something on the good old scion.

Which, I mean, if I could make some manner of, I'm just saying, don't you want to help your Empressed to be? Ah, no, I'm not a citizen of Tianja so she's not gonna be my empress. Oh, political lines of being drawn. You could be, you could get you could apply for a visa man.

It's not that it's not that hard. I think being chosen as a scion of Ahmadatu Sion actually, grant you citizenship be I get stalked at the fucking border despite being divinely. Chosen, you're gonna have to take that up with the commit at some point and that's not my bag sir, but I will remember that.

You said, no, when next, we have a discussion with the Miss Avatar suits. Sure. Mine with me. So with yourself, I mean he really think aminko would have a problem with him not giving his blood, I don't know. It depends how many they've used on her. If we all die, she might be mad.

But I think at that point, I mean, she has bigger problems. Yes she does. I knew the quick question for you. Sans, will they have any wants or settle here in town? Anyway ones probably I mean they have a spell casting limit of six level and all minor items are available.

Okay. I got some money to spend and I want to get a wand.

So Shoku would actually pull Noah aside at some point and ask her. Um when we're doing this, when we're assaulting your former clan, are you sure? We might have to kill everyone in there. Oh, I'm very much counting on that you do. There's nobody want us to try and set aside.

No one. You want us to try and spare.

She liked stops for him and thanks about it. Takes over glasses and gives him a rub.

Put them back on. I want you to kill them. So thoroughly that Furasma will not recognize their souls when they go for judgment through that kind of people. So, no, I don't want you to save anyone. I may go of course that's kind of the whole point of this But the rest they know what they signed up for Choco nods.

I appreciate that. You ask though really? Yeah.

It's hard thing when we're about to do, but we gotta

So are we just gonna strike out and or what's exactly? The plan. Are we gonna ride all day until we get there? And then just if we write out right now, like how long will it take to get there? You said it. Okay. Now is that like as in a day's travel like eight hours or as in 24 hours of travel They don't really get that specific.

So, a day of writing will probably get you there and or you will arrive there in the morning. Shortly after camping, depending on what you guys want to do. You guys are a little beat up and lacking on spell moment.

So, we could get there, We've backed them into a corner. I would like if we absolutely need to rest we can rest on the way they have Amico and we have them cornered. Yeah, I was just asking whether or not. We wanted to make the assault tonight or in the morning.

I'm not sure attacking and jahid out at night. Time would be the best idea though. It'd be funniest fuck if you did. Not that I'm suggesting it. There's no, I think, but there's also the fact that we'll be camping out in their territory. So we're going to have to set a really good watch.

Well, the benefits is that surrounding terrain near Ravens? Clog is not exactly the most hospitable anyway, So they probably won't have had enough men to feelers out much less trapped the place. I mean it's up on a cliffside, right? Mm-hmm. So, I'm running on the assumption that they don't have enough bodies because we've probably killed most of them at this point.

That's what you said. Ling walked. Late morning, level five. Ninjas still. Yeah, but no, it doesn't have this. I don't know this.

And I'm used to them being like what 15 of them? Maybe. Well, that's a pretty die. Is my die working now. No, it is not. It is still the ugly guy and he's still die. We'll work on it. Hopefully, you should all now have an anti-dops in your inventory.

I clip of Grayson.

How do I reopen the dice customization menu? It's in the chat if you scroll up. Yeah, yeah, I know, but I, I don't know what to spend my money on guys. How much money did we each get from? It's in. No ways. Just shot thing.

Oh, That's a bit more than I was expecting. I did sell up a lot of ignore that five silver. I don't know how I got that. I don't know how you got five field right about. I hope. Um, should be one silver.

I think.

Where the fuck is this thing?

Nice. Think the most useful things that I could possibly, get, are just gonna be these Shoko. Actually scratches this chin for a bit and says, Chloe, you can cast spells that are beyond your ability. If we find you a scroll of it, right? As long as it's something that any that a cleric can do, of course.

I think, Should we maybe confront the idea but these ninja, if they're backed into a corner, might elect to kill Omeko instead of hand her over to us.

And if we pull our money together, we might be able to afford a scroll of a spell to For that contingency.

So you could do that but in the absolute worst case scenario, says, no, I actually mixes her alchemical stuff together in the background you could, but we already have a worst case scenario contingent

That push the glasses up did. Did you guys, Did you guys forget what the seal can do? Oh, I completely forgot what they're looking to do.

Pulls out little notebook. And Now I don't know much about magic but I do know that I think the call me said something about flicks through pages a bit. How do you part of the knowledge on us that it can resurrect people, Alternatively, the shield condensed heel on an Amitatus ion but doing so expenses all of its magical and finally only at the discretion of the seal itself, it can customer resurrection on a Scion but doing so.

Renders its spellpass casting. Powers useless a month. We get one free month. Reset. Yep. Month-long cooldown, Of course, you do have to take it out of the wording box. And that's implies its own problems. I don't recommend it, But I'm not concerned about her being gutted at this point, which I forgot that also which explains why they're keeping her alive because that's better than killing her and leaving her somewhere.

Unless well, if I'm honest, and If I was in their position, if I was conductor, I'd honestly be waiting back for further orders from the five storms before. Actively moving. It's not like it's yes we were created and trained to sniff out Amazatus and other Scions but we're not the ones who have the final say so,

Well, in the case of direct lineage. Anyway, Scions like our good selves or father, I will be right, that I'm suggesting any of you are product. Yeah. Also, looking at our funds, I don't think we'd have the money to get a scroll of raised dead put together even if we all pooled.

Like that's that's an expensive one. We would raise dead. Scroll is including materials is 6,000 something. Oh really. Yep. Breast dad's only fifth the limitation, of course being that you have to raise somebody within days as opposed to, you know, resurrection, which is just whatever I guess.

Piano fancy seal. That's a lot of be able. We would also have to be able to find a cleric capable of casting. It wouldn't we? This is Cal's garage. There are clerics capable of raising the dead. Have you seen? How often people die here? Ah, the highest available spellcasting is six level.

I would scroll or race. That is only a oh, 1,125 gold 6,125 gold then because you need the 5,000 for the material component. I'll be. That's right. I forgot that I except totally doable if you wanted to do that, but We do already have that option in the back pocket.

If yeah, I think it better to prepare for not having to use that then So I guess I guess I will actually go shopping. Oh, I'm back. Back on the town. And while everyone is about it, you will see in the items tab a new book called a couple domain.

You meant in the chats. Well, everyone is shitting and chatting and talking Hoya performs, a little prayer to Desna and all of you can share in her domain abilities.

You can use put a man, granted part. Oh, that's that's really good actually. No, it has no idea what you're doing and hopes that there's now is feeling particularly beneficial today. But, you know, That's neat. Wait, I forgot to actually put the change in there. Speed all speeds plus 10 in the item tab of the buffs tab.

Yeah, on the item tab, it should be down at the very bottom of the buffs page. No of the the compendiums tabs right next to the actor tab. Gotcha. And that could be useful. And just not turn it on travel domain movement.

Okay, it's on.

I'm fast as fuck. Boy the fuck boy? Yep.

And her level. And we're Are you on the items directory? It's next to the older. I'm right? I don't look into the buffs.

Boom. And she has more than enough wisdom and class levels to include all of you. Nuts. Think she just got a wisdom of 21. Yeah.

Which no stuff is. No a familiar with the magic item, the gloves of reconnaissance. Would she be interested in a pair of those? Ah, The plunger has heard of them. No I haven't. She's like I have no idea what those are but they sound fancy. What are they? What do they do?

They let you see through things.

I can't find it. It's being retarded. Please don't use that word. So actors tag at the top, right, to the right of the three little cards, It should be relatively the only item in here at this point.

Yeah, I forgot how long I actually lasts for. Um,

Along what lasts work gloves of reconnaissance? Ah,

It's this is granted me. I think just through the modifier, all of the speeds I have now have 10 foot speed and climb swim burrow and fly the travel domain. Power enhances, all of your movement speeds. If you have them it doesn't give you them. That's what I thought.

I just wanted to point that out that it has it on my sheet. Yeah. You said to all the speeds? Yeah.

Oh, geez. OG just starts flying. No, actually. You do technically have five foot movement, speed, and half your movement. Speed will climbing if you succeed, so it would still increase those speeds but it doesn't provide you like a burrow speed or a fly speed, okay? She dies underground.

Terribly helpful for the fact that are we resting. That is an important question because you're also going to be leveling to six Bruh. Oh no, oh no. Okay. So we are actually going to take our little break here. Well, you guys finish your shopping and leveling and so you lied to get something to drink any more tea.

You lie directly to my face when I said and we level all to six. Yeah, you oh god, right? Okay. It's before you go into Ravens crack though. Well whatever, I'm not. Not gonna look against holes in the mouth. Okay. I mean Amendable also been really high last week and read it wrong.

I don't know. You're fine. That's just one of the point that out that I was like as you live a little to six. All right. Let's Guys, I have third global spouse now. Yeah. Oh I actually might spend some of my money to get scrolled. Put it into my phone book.

That sounds like an awesome idea. I might use the scroll of this palmatic we have and put it in my book. Sure.

Should we not level up yet? Are we all planning on resting before we leave or we planning on resting? When we get closer to there? Can we get a consensus on that given?

I think we're gonna rest when we get closer so that um, that's one vote closer. I vote closer. Abby, I'm down to the rest whenever you guys are good. Like I'm a fucking ninja. I don't give a shit Grayson slash video. Do you guys care? If we do it now or as we get closer, if you're having, I said to level up now.

So I'm just leveling up right now. That's what I was gonna. Okay, Right. Do it.

That's about what I expected. Don't you love getting a one? Yep, I never roll on anything with Lux than a D10. It die because it's just not exciting to get a one on a class that like has a D6. Hit die. Yep, It's funny when you're playing like a barbarian and you get a one and it's, it's incredible when you get a high number.

But it's just like on something that has such a on a D8 or lower. It feels like just take the averages. I have a foundry question for you guys. I've been doing manual health every time, right? Taking the average Do I have to account for my Charisma Boatner, charisma Constitution.

No, it's automatically director, right? Yes, good. I just want to make sure I was like, I could be missing five HP.

Yeah. Okay I got fast light steps. These this thing. Okay. Yeah, I got stupid fucking ninja ability.

All right, so what does level five bar? Get I have a motherfucking key pool. Congratulations on learning how to key.

I'm so excited for this.

I get another spell learned inspire courage. Goes up to plus two like it lore master once per day, but I don't think I do. I think I replace that. Yes, I do. I replace that with.

Wanting refrain.

I need a fear spell.

Oh, we gotta figure out what third level stocks. That prepared. Whichever one perfect back and choose from the pickup. Two free education through the 12.

The Q3 and I've got fireball and lightning version.

That picked up a framework hasted fly. What do you think? Would be more useful.

I mean to good I I don't know. Either could be good.

I feel like cases more, broadly useful, but it would be good to have a way to fly.

That, you know, the extra another arcane exploit and picking up the quick study and Houghton metric explains.

You know, I was joking about it, I might legitimately just take drugs

Blood question is, what do you think? Would be a good? I'm going to pull the trip or take the third level.

It's hard because hasters well, for the whole party, but if we find something that's flying or like, we need flight for something, and it would be good to have at least one way of getting access to it.

You think Gabby a professionally? Did you take quick study? This one, I don't get an exploit until next level. If we are, Is every olive level. Why? Yeah. Okay.

Yeah shit. Um I know what seventh of all I am picking quickly. Yeah. Okay. So generically given that we are going through a fortress. I suspect that we would If we're going to have any problems of flying things, that's going to be in getting cute because I'd hope that, you know the rest of it in the side somewhere.

Um, hasters of a false multiplier, those no way around that. It's powerful spells almost the most powerful spelling, okay? And I,

So,

I mean what were you the options? I take whatever makes sense to you. Like I've been the person who often had one third level slot and I was the only Arcancaster and I said I'm prepping lightning bolt today in the party. Looked at me, I said I'm prepping liking Bolton you punched off me.

Like, well, I've got I have Fireball, lightning bolt just and fly. Those are my options, right? Here's the most widely act likeable one like life. It is functional for everybody upon. I'm not saying that's just of the two weapon fighter sneak attacker it. When you have quick study, you'll be able to use that for, you know, kind of the rest of utilitarian stuff.

Flight, I am less concerned about entirely because Grace and exists.

So that's That's my opinion on that, you can of course, choose whatever you think. Like you want to just choose, it might not be the most option, but it makes sense for your character. So here I'm making a very responsible choice right now, but with that, Alright, double X doing whatever damn time.

We have you seen LA putting a lot of, don't get symbols directly like etching it onto a brush. He's like, don't worry about it. It's fine. It's fine, guys. Don't worry. We're on break right now.

This is not going to be a problem. I think I'll prep hate. I shoot game hiring. I could fireball. But that would hurt party in a way. Guess. We'll just dive it. Like yeah, you choose what you want to Fireball's. Great. Like me, It depends on like what you want to do with your character.

I definitely like I said, being the person who's like, no, Now I'm doing this thing. Figure it out, You've got to have fun too, you know? Where you watching Miss Congeniality. That's a good. I'll figure it out honestly. Don't remember. I'll take. Yeah, so you need a couple times.

It's really good. I remember like seeing that when I was younger, but I don't remember it at all, okay? Yeah, that's that's all right here. But,

Some of these spills are not, there's a weirdly not fear spells when they like, I was paranoia not a fear spell.

Americans are too fat. It made me appreciate white people because only they think it's shit like this. It made me appreciate white people because only they think is stupid shit like this. It made me appreciate white people because I think I speak for all Arizona's when I say to the snowbirds that are coming to Arizona right now drive, Hi, you.

This is our newest and everyday is a dream when I'm carry all carrying to and every day is a dream. When I'm carrying your marble players limited options when wolves and just

I said happened.

Is a terrible thing that men don't talk. And after years, have not been able to

Your car.

Fight through the pain.

Oh, all right. Pick up two new spells. Sweet. Here was him in Greater magic button.

Come on. I think I might apparent preparing heroes and he said, I think that's probably like the most same one right now with your calculator, different.

Birds incredible. Breeding. Well it's rained. The people out some of my money. I have Yeah but the downside of the limited cells may power on. All right. Yeah, and what? I'm down. I'm still I took out almost four thousand, but I know after I really moved up then down.

I've got 38 68 right now.

That is the one thing I don't have with the headband.

Over there, but any return? To him right now, since the bed, pretty much that is kidneys were atrophying. Last time we took a minute, he's on a bunch of meds and now he's got new foods and treats and It's cool. And his kidneys are going. First, I was gonna say he's faking it.

But now that seems insensitive is he's not thinking. He is very good at being dramatic though, but he's quieter about it. The most huskies. He just looks at you really sad with his head down on his paws. It's most huskies are. Very dramatic. Can confirm huskies are generally very dramatic.

My husky is a bit of a drama queen. You're both insane for even having one and my brother's a personal china. It works out and we're moving into a house so much bigger backyard framed to run around in, he doesn't run that much anymore.

With whom everyone finished levels. I believe. So yeah, picked up. I picked up a couple scrolls, by the way. Sans. Okay, third double scroll. So, we can add to my spellbook.

Very good. Are they spells? I need to worry about.

I mean, they're just the ones I picked up were greater magic, weapon heroism Lightning bolt and Fireball. Oh yeah. Unless you're picking up like evil dark forbidden, magics, he trust you to handle all of that bookkeeping. I mean I was thinking of picking him right? A raise of exhaustion, Arab Exhaustion.

I don't know how much. How how helpful that'll be?

Well below me, my new spell sounds evil but it is not technically evil. Uh, That's no. But yeah that. Oh, I need to find a way to apply my bonuses to it, my plus one, two, it being in enchantment DC at my plus two for it being a fear effect, because I'm a dirge board.

Which will crank its DC up to 21, which is quite good for this level. I think. Rich bar.

Yeah, I I was trying to put it in from features, the feature. It's called haunting refrain and it doesn't have it.

And I just remember we talked about like how are we going to make up things like spell focus? Apply to specific types of spells and you said you, it didn't really know What they become context notes in the buffs and so hunting refrain. It doesn't increase your DC. It implies applies a penalty.

So that penalty is actually. I something I would additionally the role saving throws against any fear effects. He creates are made with a minus. Okay. Oh, that means that I will apply a minus two penalty through the opponent's role when they make it. Okay.

Hey, any other level of questions? Now, I'm just testing. The fact I rolled the one for my health.

Crying. He took a risk, I took a risk and was rewarded as I expected. That is That is the life that I need. Unfortunately looks like you and Ochi both or what is that? B6 royalty. I just wanted to look at my cool dice. I got a five. I take manual right?

That's smart. Person over there. I took I took my manual of four on our famous. Yeah, yeah. You've all got more health than me. I got it. I cry over here. It's my I'm just.

Did you guys decide on resting? We are at like four out of five on we rest as we near, okay? I mean I kind of what he said, you know, morning the party, leave the place that way. I've got the smells like if we get ambushed When, Well, I did ask and everybody else chimed in.

But the rest will happen as you approach.

But,

Which is good. That's where we will start off.

Recently, it's not upfront person.

Activate.

It seems like an excellent place to camp for the evening. You have a choke point a clearing.

So and an ocher jelly emerging from beneath the bridge. How fantastic Knowledge Engineering.

Wow. All on red light district today.

I think Shoko knows what it is Yoko. Do know what it is. Open. Boom. So, it is a large ooze. It's vision. Is blindsight. What would you like to know You'll have three questions?

Does it have any special defensive properties? So like any immunitys? Anything that'll happen. If we hit it a certain way, yes, it is. Immune to electricity, mind affecting, it has standard oot straights. It's also immune to slashing and piercing damage. And if it is struck by slashing piercing or electricity damage, it has the defensive ability split in which it becomes two identical jellies.

All right. Shoko will reiterate. That that that don't do those things. It'll make more of them. You in this way. But you will have to split them and then split them and split them and basically split them until they can split no more.

How do they attack? Take time and they generally roll towards you try to grab onto you with their Uzi tentacles and squeeze you onto their acidity bodies. Hmm. And how fast are they not particularly? They have a movement speed of 10 feet.

All right, so Shoko would suggest we pipe this thing and four walks at it until it is. No, he's just gonna sit back and watch this.

Join me on initiative.

Sorry my PC's having a heart attack.

Here, I do. It question for you. How long has it been since? The whole And since we shopped and then we headed out considering this is where you're camping. Probably a good five or six hours. Okay. So, my main camera would be expired at this point, please?

Initiative. And if you

They going dead. Last. It's absolutely in character you and Koya are both going after it actually where we're just back here. Laughing new. You are ever so.

Might help have actually had, you know my tokens are my token selected. It does tend to help.

I'll move to there.

Targeting the boot and then blasting him.

If I can find it, they're

Boom, you sonic blast the jelly reverberates, a great deal. Sending particulates of icker in every direction and that's the end of history. And then it jiggles like Jill, both full of jelly, All right. All right, I don't like that. I don't like looking at it. I don't like thinking about it, he should have ever seen.

Shoko will cast Mirror image and get up in his face.

You know, I get four images. Sweet. Not.

And I will, and my turn.

Sushoco was able to tell us that if we cut this thing, it's a split into what is here? Caster level mirror. This little board. You got five images. Oh, and you get an extra one for every three casser levels you have. Oh. All right. If we slice it, it splits into more or we do a damage threshold, it splits and you slice it, if you pierce it or if you're shock it, it will split into more until we can split.

No, no further. So, I will just use stick and beat it with a stick.

I'm going up. Oh she the whole point of me, putting myself here is that I'm I'm kind of hard to hit with all these and I gestured of my clones a kind of put myself here so that it wouldn't hit you guys.

Okay, I'll stand here and shoot it with a two barrel. I will have drawn that instead.

Oh, yeah. Two barrel that does piercing Ochi OG I just told you. Yeah, I'm gonna stand back here. You got this?

Let's,

You and paste.

That's why you rocks. Rocks there they bludge it. They hear. Oh,

That's all I have for my turn. No, it might be unable to actually act on her tone because she's been struck with hideous. Laughter. Just want you to know this. Oh my goodness.

Oh, shaka charges.

The boom.

I'll go and way less worried about these things.

I had a bad experience with. Once we're a nearly TPKed, the whole party because we thought it if we kept putting it into pieces that like the little pieces might be less powerful. They're not, They don't know, they're not, they just have to help. They hit just desired. You.

That's not people skip him, Grayson.

Grayson, will forward not doing a charge attack secret set, AC still, and we'll just pick out at this is it's done for bro over for this. It's yep. The feeder coming out, like, I hope he doesn't roll high.

He's just lulling it into a false sense. Excuse me, you actually super super hit it. It's easy as for, yeah. It's it's it's it's it is a jello to mold. What? It does not have armor. What I tell no obliters another terrifying. Jill jiggle of ocher jelly before Grayson's foot, appears through the other side of this one.

And I just lumps into the river beneath it. Oh yeah. Get the jelly all over that foot. Oh yeah. Away? What? That just, that just went places. I'm not, I'm done call you. And then he puts his foot in the the river to wash off the You. Oh my god, time.

He tries to murder you. I deserve it. It unfortunately. Misses. Oh, oh yeah. Just looks very confused and no one has any damage. She doesn't want to throw her star knife. So he just how cold uncontrollably next to Nate next. To no way. No nice. Nice for on just no hitting us laughter, you can you didn't know my touch.

She's just there with fucking coil. Like I forgot we in now.

Oh,

I should make an improvised weapon attack.

Oh wait you. That attack. Does pop. One of my images though, gotta be That's it. I'm going to spend a at the Swift action. A mystery AC. So it wouldn't have hit any images as long as it gets within five, it hits an image. Oh, All right so I'm spending our pain point two up.

The caster level of my next felt, okay.

And go ahead and modify that real quick. Yeah. Yeah.

And then I'm then I'm going to cast on the one in front of Shoko, scorching ray

I'm loving the amount of dice we're seeing on screen now. This makes me happy. This. Yes, I like this. It's good stuff. Oh close, but not quite

And that's the end of my turn. Oh, shoko and I just strike it with the bomber of my weapon. Can that be like an improvised weapon attack? You got throw rocks, you get a little rocks. Well like I mean the palm oil is like a blunt object. It's so like it's oh yeah we get it.

Well, let's just do a regular attack for improvised weapon.

I think it's a minus two and release. That's not helping it would just do. Look, you want to do when the three budgeting damage on with my strength? I wouldn't do anything. So, I guess, Shoko will take the total defective action. Whoo. Okay. Okay. Now, I'm gonna run up to it and hit it with a stick.

Boom Unfortunately can't be crit but you do kill it. And it also ripples verbals and then balls down into the river and washes. Hey. And then OG's gonna take his double walking stick katana and just rub it on the grass to get the the juice off it. I guess, Shoko will check under the bridge real quick to make sure there's not more of them.

There's 50 more of them, the 15. There's a lot of moves under one branch.

Man that thing really like jiggled, I don't, I don't think I've ever watched people. And so I look towards a fucking pudding. I it ever seen anyone, Oh, Jelly and be like, violence OG runs up. There's like I hate tapioca and just smacks it with this stick.

Oh, Crown me and take me to hey fang. I'm dead. Well, it might look funny but you haven't seen what happens when those things get there. Yeah, and I pseudopods tentacles, I don't know what you'd call them. He?

Video. Just shakes his head muddenly wherever I got myself into. Nice kick Grayson. You get around the course us laughing. So hard at this ooze. Is, how is how we get up? Fucking super big CR ooze? And the actual dungeon, Like, what's a really scary? One, like a black pudding or something like pudding.

Bring it? No, no. Because it's you scariest. Um, who's I have ever seen is one that I not has a gravitational pull? What that ones for it? Can fly Plasma mode. My breath. You've experienced the hell. That is the plasma as I see. Yeah. As you know, fucking hell that room.

All I could I joined that group and in person group joined it for a little while until the campaign fell apart because you know random things happen and people couldn't come to give me kind of work. Schedules usual. Yeah.

And we were keeping eight at the plasma news. Yeah. So did we? We lost a we lost a player and it was the first place where I couldn't cast disintegrate. I was like, oh Oh, this is problematic. But yeah. Um, well done on fighting a giant mass of tofu I'm impressed.

I I try to stay humble but one with opponents like that I can't help but feel my ego and played a little And OG being right next. To no way. Just elbows are in his like, what did I tell? You. Look at those kicks. Oh yeah. No fucking terrifying.

Grayson remind me again. Where did you learn? How to do that.

Uh, no need to remind you. I never told you in the first place. Yeah, that was kind of the hint. I was gonna be, you know, like decent about it. But No seriously. Like what? What school are you from? I learned it in my McClain holds and then a lot of practicing with chilela.

Yeah. Oh, and traustin double heard of Dwarven-based martial art extense, you know? I just expected. It would be more, She makes a motion as if to like at the distance that you're away from how she kind of, like, rounds your outline and then almost picks. It open. Throws it.

I was expecting more that from From tour even much love.

I gotta say what. The. So, with my engineering, check what I know, like the usual habitat of Anoka jelly, like is it odd that we found one out here in the wilderness in the colds? They don't particularly need warm temperatures, but this is not its normal habitat. No, like under a bridges, not usually where they hide.

Mmm, I think I think that might have been a surprise left for us by the shadows. Then in which case, if this is their idea of a trap, then, no, I don't think we have much to worry about from their trappings of the castle. No. It's just, I'm, I'm trying to mentally visualize Kim and Dotsu Luring that thing into our path.

And honestly, that's gonna let me dream so peacefully tonight. Speaking of we'd better get some rest, let's get camp. Set up. Look shot goes, like already said a fire and shit. While you guys were talking,

He was being castic presentation on people that were up front. You know, beating it. Beating it up.

Oh, just he'll get. He'll go get some firewoods.

Yeah, you guys want to do anything while you're camping?

I guess just check like the the sort of immediate area around like has this road been used? Like recently, Is there any Well Ash? Okay, it does look like it's been used very recently. Let's see. But then only yogurt because she can fly. Yeah, yeah. I figured that's, but they're very large bird, footprints on this road, and normal human footprints and try.

Speaking of birds, uh if we're within a mile of the of the fortress then I could ask the local bird population. One question. Ask away. Well, what do you think? I should ask. It'd have to be something that birds would know.

I mean does that count as your one question?

What? Oh, you get it. I just give a moment. I was gonna let it lay there Grayson. I was just leaving it alone. I was like, nope. Nope, that's fine. Yes, you see? No, I take out like this bar and configure it into. It's a traveler's, any tool, and like configures it into a shovel.

And it's just like and you help me just make my own grave right now. Just this is what I want to remember. As I go to Harasma, I should have let the jelly. Eat all of you.

But justice was swift. My good friend If not necessarily delicious. Okay. Oh, geez. Swift. I think I have let's see. Survival right for tracks to follow them or like know about them, because I'd like to roll on the tracks a little bit. Oh, they are Tengu tracks but like I was I was gonna try and use survival to determine the number and how long ago, the people and the Tangu came through here.

All right, I don't know what difficulty that is or if that's in the realm. What I rival rule. I mean, once I stopped like rolling on the ground, laughing get a plus two, which I'll help you out a 15 then. Um, less than 30 more than 15 individual tracks that you can pick out.

That's a good number. We should definitely set watches tonight.

I don't closer until we've had some rest.

So can we set up a camp and do a rest? I think I noticed the I can ask the birds. Oh, Oh no Shoko will cast commune with birds. I'll throw it up here.

Um, and I'll go with a asking the local birds. If the humans dressed and black, do they prowl the wilds tonight? Looking for prey? Or are they hold up in their nest? That's two questions.

I know the other I think it's A or B. So all right. Do they in a mile? Give me just one moment cuz there's very specific birds. And then Fred who's not that far away. It's like, oh no, we're coming after you tonight.

As you cast the spell, after you've kept the spell, Hundreds of hundreds of ravens. Come swirling about you, Oh no.

And they tell you, yes, you are being hunted. Oh, she walks up to Shoko and says hey man. Can you never do that again? You would be hunted. Now, if our master knew you called us, They know, they know they know oh she's gonna hit this one with a stick.

You would you exactly Ravensworm? Don't attack them. Oh she's like halfway through his way. Not a good idea. Oh geez halfway through his swing with the stick and stops. He's just gonna like, do a little jab poke. And he's like, all right and he doesn't because he kind of he doesn't think about it as first and then he does look around and look at the number of him and it's like maybe not

But yes, the general. They tell you that you are being hunted.

I want one. I think you see the little eyeballs we had in their mouths. Yes, yes, I did.

Your cousins are weird, don't you? So are yours a congratulations. You get pre-warning that there are raven, swarms in Raven's Craig, there. I think we have to be. I can't imagine there's a I can't imagine there's a lot of parties that do that specifically and try and commune with birds and then the Ravens forms.

Like oh yeah, we're gonna get you, man.

I mean, probably not Good to know though. Oh, just gonna go back to get firewood. The two times I've used that spell. I have not expected the outcomes. I think that might BYOT is so keen on. You not repeating the effort.

I personally think should keep doing it. It's quite interesting and frankly, useful information it positives to our collective health.

So let's roll up a rest question, mark. Oh, you would like to. There's a lot more RP at this little campaign expected. I think we should set a watch in Paris tonight. Indeed to shoko have dark vision. I need to check. I'm gonna hit rest. You, I don't know.

I'm Christian I don't think he does no.

Well, I know Now I would volunteer for like the second shift. Anyway, because I mean, it's darkness, of course, I'm gonna volunteer for the second shift. I'll go for the, what would be a third shift towards the end towards the dawn?

Okie dokie. We should probably just set up like a standard one at this point. And just real like here,

That's a really good point. Yeah. Shoko will take first. Watch, Grayson can take third.

Right. This.

Spinach loading, I don't know. Even take a watch.

As a cluster, who requires a certain amount of rest, I don't know how that deal works. Few.

I need you the cycle that, like we, we sleep for 10 hours overall to make up for the fact that people are up for two.

Something like that.

All right, who is on third? Watch Third watch is myself and Grayson. I believe.

Here.

Imagine realize like a cast. A couple spells women. No, if we get attacked in the middle of the night then we're kind of screwed. Like we that uses up that wastes our rest only if you can't spells, okay. That's a house roll. But I am stealing that house or electrically.

That's well it's it's a bit more. It's, it's more leeway than normal if you don't engage in the combat and you let your party handle it and you just keep killing over there. You can be woken in the middle of a rest and still go back to sleep.

Yeah. It doesn't have to be continuous like it, like, it has to be eight hours of rest. But you can like if you get if you have four hours and then you get into rupted and do whatever certain classes that fox some other Most classes, though. So your classic wizard sort of are just like, okay, I need to continue my rest as long as you haven't done anything extremely exerting, which casting a spell out I would actually.

So yeah, I mean, I could just, I could just, you know, Flash them with an arcane X with my Sonic plots. If needed, that's not really getting as felt That is still an exertion like you spending plasma points. It's what a supernatural ability. Yeah, So it's not an extraordinary ability, so it's not like super innate.

It's still an explosion of power.

But resuming Perception. Checks for me, please.

Here comes a 35 from Grayson.

All right, Grayson

You see a pair of birdie footprints appear in the snow, my hair than my ping working.

Well then, let me reload.

You guys come here, often.

Pardon. Oh, that might be why I started lagging suddenly, Netflix was playing.

Mmm.

You see some 30 footprints appear in the snow right over here? And at the same time You hear a twig snap over here. Only crazy only Grace. And here's this. No, he actually beat two of the ones with higher stealth roles. You will only beat one of them.

Who appears in the snow right here, just their footprints. So, you guys Grayson sing, where these two are OSG seeing where this one is, as well as Grayson. He also sees the other well, so much for only the higher ups knowing how to turn invisible. I never said that.

I said if they are are taking their time like sneaking towards us. They are Grayson wants to get just like a big handful of snow and just like toss it in this space where he sees the footsteps behind it. They use it like like flour or something to coat and invisible person.

I see what you're going for there and I will let that work for the round. You hit them after that. The snow will either melt or become invisible with them.

You, If you would make a range attack for me against touch AC

Very nice higher low worth it. Hi.

The Tango narrowly evades. The snow. You see part of it brush. What? Looks like an arm. I would improved precise shot have any effect on that.

That have any effect on concealment. It's tall concealment so which is what invisibility provides.

Let me nor easy bonus, granted by targets of anything less than total cover and the mischance granted by targets it by anything less than total concealment. So not quite. I didn't know they made improved versions of precise shot. Oh yeah. I'm precise is amazing because otherwise you end up taking like negatives.

Every time you try and fire at someone through a doorway? Yeah, that's fair. So unfortunately. No, because they are getting total concealment. Okay. I I don't know how we're going to fight for invisible enemies. They're not it's not greater invisible. You don't know it. That's fair. I'm not helpful.

I'm gonna be. So I'm the sound of combat. Wake the rest of us up. I mean, we haven't gone into initiative yet and he was like he saw before. I'm gonna say with his better perception role. I think that Grayson saw these things happening before OG did. But we haven't like I was gonna whistle first thing.

Why are your initial go private?

Oh, should we write it and ochi you both get to accent in the surprise rounds? Should we all know you guys rolling it?

Okay, and then after we do this round we will bring in everyone else. Basin. What would you like to do? Christian will show out loud that there's an ambush and, and gosh, I yes. Trying to shoot at the one that he threw Snow at it. You get one attack because of the surprise around.

That's okay, you're busy trying to wake everyone up, everyone perception. Minus 10, please.

Everyone. Well, everyone who's asleep?

Okay. I but I only needed a five. You're good. No, no. That's before the minus 10. Oh, you are sleeping quite soundly this evening.

No, no. He's immediately awake. You just see like, jackknife, I won't.

In boom. All right. No way, Koya.

Option.

Look shaka. Right, you guys all wake up. You will get to join combat next round. Nope. Nope. So, does he wake up to? It's the only needed if

Boom. Oh, gee, rapping bird feed up here in the sand or in the snow before you Here before me. Yes. Okay. A 14. It's your flat footed. AC, it does not the boom and while he appears his form is still blurred,

Shoko a 23 to hit your butt. Put it AC. I mean considering I'm unconscious, isn't this? Like an automatic crit. No, he had to move 10 feet.

He needs a full round of insta kill. Yes, all right. Well then I assumed this wakes me up. Yes, this will very much. Wake you up? Just a gentle stabbing to wake you up in the morning. Oh, I'm fixing their. We get back for some reason, it broken.

Okay, I have to change these dies since they are very cool looking but they are bogging me down.

Thing. Good ninja. Boom, charges the dwarf.

But around 15, I get your blood-footed.

Sorry for my computer, even just check it. Miss. Yay. The upper class assassins are doing great. Let's see here. So this is a meta question is grappling worthless. If I haven't invested into it, because I don't know, I guess I could make a knowledge. Check to see if they may disappear again, but I really want to know where they are so that other people can beat the heck out of them.

So I'd love to like, grab him and hold him As part of your getting the FYI, from Noah, she would have told you if you're in a situation where you can't see and ninja grab a hold of them and then beat the shit out of them if you can.

That's what I thought. So I think that is what I'm going to go for. Can I don't have the relevant knowledge to know more about the frozen shadows tangu specifically right? I don't get to do that. Uh, no. That's what I thought. That's okay. So we'll How do I make a CMB check?

Here it is. I'm gonna try and grab all the tangu right next to me.

Go for it. I'm gonna say that's a no. That is definitely a no. Yeah, so Ochi whiffs trying to hug this guy.

And then he cries if any crime.

Bringing us to our next Tango. Ninja just crazy wake up.

Is that that's what you.

Removed and go ninja Quit.

The circuit. Oh, my, yeah. That's, that's, yeah. That's, that's that. That's can that's a hit. And I confirm, oh,

And hit that where I put it also, you know, sneak attack. Mastering it. Just roll its character sheet.

Five points of sneak attack. It's gonna be very pissed off. Hi. And now everyone joining initiative and everyone's awake.

Oh, that one did that one day that, you know kind of hit me.

Did he end up? You know, becoming visible. Oh yes.

That everyone, Nope, still Luke Shaka.

Alright, Top of the round, Grayson

Chris is just going to point blank, shoot, the one right next to him with the gear.

Of my you. It's it's oh there's a miss and he's dead.

Whoopa.

Picked him for no reasons it. That was Shoko. That was so much damage.

Shoko will. That was 60 damage. Take out his weapon and look up at the sky and say that's rollerblers and I will make a defensive casting cat. Check, I succeed for mine. The blurs wouldn't have matter because I got the improved say improve the shot. Oh, that's very useful.

Good. There's a reason. It's BAB allowances. Normally 11 by touching creature. What's up related instrument, you call the creatures flesh to loosen and slide against you, okay? And roles that check for me.

Is there just why isn't there just a button to roll base attacks like this? I guess. I'll have to calculate it. So nope. There. There is it right? Click your token under your dropdown menu on the attack tab, you'll have your regular melee range.

Just you and we jump to the stone, I'm gonna fix it.

Standard touch.

Actually amazing spell attack ability dexterity animated formula. Boom Next 5. What kind of damage do you just untied damage, huh? That's very what kind of type, what kind of damage would you call that? Boom, 10. A lot of pain fortitude, it's not offset.

And and let's see if that worked. What's that?

But I probably miss with an 11.

Yeah, you get a bonus to range attacks while you're probably not mainly but you are still holding those nutshell.

I guess I'm staying prone because I don't want to provoke an attack by getting up seems fair. Boom, bringing us to Koya. Um,

Boom. Wholesale her wand and CEO with it. A really bad role. That's a okay, that's a little about wrong. All right.

Look, shaka does stand up Drawing her weapons that she does.

People looking.

Bring up the new way to steps. Thank you again. Steps off from being prone drawing, one of the lockizes and then uses a 5 foot to go here. And then vanishes,

Because I am, I am definitely in a light level lower than normal, right? Yes. Yeah. So this shizoku just like fades out and then so does the rest of her.

And that, that is my time because I can't do much else. Boom, the tango looks in your direction things to step back.

And pulls out a boat blue gun. Not unlike ochis.

The okay below gun? Or the thing, the Ochi has on his character sheet because I don't have a blowgun, it's a blue gun. Okay. I was like, he better not. Yeah, not a two barrel. Shoot, not a two-barrow shooter. Sorry. Well I also have a different tube thingy that I never use many tubes.

Why like so many tubes?

Oh, geez actually played by Lizzo. So, he plays the flute. This makes a lot. Boom, this thing. You continues trying to stab you with his wakazashi. There is not have haste. They're mr. Proman. Oh my all. It doesn't confirm, that's good. Boom. Do I have to make another saved to keep as well?

No, it's already cast. Okay, it's just in your hand, you release the charge. How did I get that health? Did I get healed at some point?

No. Huh. Because morning I put down that I took that damage, right? Let me just scroll back up to it. It was seven damage and a 9 precisions equals, right? So, 25 damage Soko's bloodied.

You were in a lot worse shape than I thought. You were Leo, Mia will stand up, which will provoke

A game next to him.

Yeah, that's gonna hit all right. One second guys.

Interesting.

Please resume. All right, so then he put and then, while he stands up, he pulls out his, his mate. And he's gonna try and beat the shit out of the IDEX to him.

He's good.

Actually hits. And that is almost half as health.

That is the end of his third.

The first time he's pulled out that mace.

Y'all got maces? Yeah, he's had a mace. He's gonna meet stand across club.

I mean yeah. That makes sense. But like No, it's just like you can swing without them.

Apparent. You take the guys kneecap off. Apparently, you can noted.

Oh, right? I mean he's not very not very amazing at the springs, but he's there. Cranking us to weigh-ins turn.

That was not way yet, Are you sorry? I was just clicking around on my sheet. Oh,

And indeed, not actually be there.

Single attack. Oh, this is 16 and fortunately.

The end go there.

A tiny creatures. The way in is in his space. Oh gee. Okay. After having failed to get this boy last time with a hug, he's going to move. Like so drawing his weapons as he does and making an acrobatics to avoid the attacks of opportunity. He's holding a blue gun.

This other guy he can make it exactly.

I think you are good. You weren't the most grateful Tengu on the map. He's gonna swing at the guy, he tried to hug. And it's just a regular one, shouldn't need anything else, a one swing? That hits and he's gonna say. Where do you think you're going? Stay and fight me.

And that'll be OT stern.

Bringing into singing Newton.

Who continues his orders to try and kill the wizard?

It only Here, I really thought he would try and stab me one time. He does take a step back though.

15 hit and in 19 it. Yeah. Both of those with him. Horton. One is the first one though.

Roll fortitude for me, please. Love what?

One point of Constitution damage. Ah, lovely.

And it'll go by. I'm sure Zeo's Constitutions really high, so it won't matter.

You, I go here and then I'm gonna go here.

And the helmet flies up and tries to headbut the Sangu in the back of the head, not doing well.

With his minus four strength. I gotta pick his breath. Weapon. Grayson going to shoot at the one. He's got selected. So, the one that was attacking zero,

He great rules is obliterated. No. This one over here. Yeah. Okay 13 misses the 25. Hits for 15. The 16 hits for another 13 that drop him.

The second one. Not go through. It drops him alive. Even all in one, all of these assassins should have been trying to go. I mean, didn't I do 10 point to damage you should? I did almost half his health. He did. I was so when he did took another 26, I was like fighting.

He, but one of the must not have gone through Shoko. Heck. Yeah. In the Tangu, should both have been trying to come.

Well, this time I will Try to hit again.

A. All right. Now, you actually that fortune safe up to that.

Ready to go.

There we go. Fourtitude tape. Oh my god. Finally.

Then Shoko will stand up because he is now staggered. Which re-key cannot take a ops. Well, why is he taking 17 damage as it also does? Oh, that only place to another creature. Never mind. Now, apologize because not said anything.

That good. Oh well, to be fair, you touch him.

We didn't just we're not prepared for Grayson. We didn't roll that concealment on my attack, on this guy.

Oh, that's fair. He still would have dropped. And this guy hasn't been hit yet. I poked in one time Did you poke him? I thought you poked the other dude, I had this one targeted.

All right, chuckle, get up pick up his shields and and turn somewhere.

You did you did seven points damage to him. Apologies. I did not apply the damage. That's okay. But again, we have to roll the percentage for it if he's got blurred going.

You hit him?

Show go. This is for you.

He is regretting the purchase of this one. It is not serving her well so far.

Oh, shaka. This kit one? Nope. Nope. No five foot step here.

Let's do single attack.

Slim and then long sort mind.

Up over attack. Boom. She is just beating the fuck out of that tengu with her shield and sword. No way he's making parable squawking. Noises amazingly Ms. Chances.

They're blur has done nothing for them and maybe maybe a little of done something at some point.

Can I say invisible things and they you don't know. Well no they can't. You're about to attack. No it seems completely unaware of you. Thank you. I mean I mean he looks like he knows he went invisible and that you might be a threat to him but it's not like he's tracking your movements and at the same time he's getting slammed in the face with the old.

Yep. That's and then you murder him. Oh no. Yeah, just you guys at the front, just see a sword just appear through his chest. Just sup? It's pretty bad, not bad. Yeah, he drops. Um, so this homie can only take a move action or standard action and thus tries to move away.

Working attacks opportunity from Shoko who is now standing algebraval and the monkey Monkey Pirates.

One level.

Pockets sneak attacks. Not working. Either, Why is think that broken on all these guys. So you see the monkey bite into his ankle and rip out his achilles tendon.

By time flavoring that one non-lethal damage he rips out his Achilles tendon. There was this thick, sneak attack damage that it. Oh Nick, I'm gonna switch to doing non-lethal, that's really brutal. Yeah no it's not the non-lethal they they have a racial sneak attack die, he dead legs in but in the calf he like punches him.

Yeah. Did the back of the leg. That's, that's probably much more accurate. It does have two slam attacks as well, the boom city.

Look at why he's thinking to text messed up later Shoko. You get an attack of opportunity. Is trying to flee.

Yeah, yeah, I will absolutely take that attack.

I think I'll try and trip him because I don't I since I have my shield up, I won't be able to do a need real damage. And no, This is the art. I found for them by the way, forgot.

I will unfortunately fail to strip him So I'm 10 15.

25. 30, it cannot take the withdrawal actions. The only moving him. His movement speed did algevolt, take an AOL on it as well. Oh, he did not. I forgot. Thank you for the reminder. Boom, I just want to watch the world bird. It's he fails. Mainly is not his strong suit.

Deo. Some seal will part his wand of magic missile. Yeah, no, dude.

And just see how pulls out, as one. Normally people have to pay for that. Got David happy. So, Lily, target the dude with his wand. All three missiles.

He's just trying to go home.

Oh, I think I gotta make out of portages save, right? Yes. Or we've done around. Okay. Okay, here, I will link it again for you.

We gotta roll the damage again. Anyways, least. You're getting minimum damage. Yay, One more successful. Save and you were free of this late poison that they each have dose of

Well, this thing is that played was on the first start. He fired. Boom. So, there's a dart by the way, with death blade extract, like somewhere in this general area because he missed OG with it.

I mean, it's not very hard to hit me when I don't have HR and stuff.

Oh, I thought I hit interned. I take it that dude stall. I've he is, in fact still alive.

Way and moves right here.

What?

Okay, put it like this.

And clips it. With an arrow are with a dagger with a tiny dagger.

And just love effect, he created on it with it, the dagger hits him square in the back of the head.

He?

Okay.

That's not what I wanted to do, or you sure about that.

Can I make it that far? That's what I was trying to measure. I don't know if it's subtracted it from my movement but I have 50. Yeah, you can easily make it that part.

Yeah, we're gonna go like right there and I'll roll acrobatics if you wants to be spicy about. He is still staggered and ochi will.

He's gonna try and non-lethal him. He's already got it. Bunch of non-lethal. Oh, do they not? I can't just add the non-lethal on top of the lethal and knocking below. You can you can just choose to do not only full damage. I mean, he already has loan people because the monkey has been hitting him.

Yeah. Do I take a minus for doing so with my weapons? I'm pretty no. We're using elephant in the room. You just can't crit with only people. Okay. So I'll roll. Regular attack. That sounds great.

God damn it. That didn't work. Like I wanted it to wait, the fuck, is that? Because critical confirmation. I tried to add a role at the beginning. Like I saw Zeo had for against concealment and it took it as my attack roll. That's not a concealment thing. Magic missile just hits.

Yeah, it just does that because it sucks let me. I'll just take that modifier off and swing again and we'll see what it actually was.

Is that better? It is an unfortunate miss but it is better. Okay, fix that thing.

That's about all I can do by the way. You like, well I still have and here Reth Weapon. That's he is well in hand. Grayson. Well, Are we trying to capture this one alive? I was just gonna see like oh man, he didn't have the blood geos. So I was hoping maybe these tango a little bit higher ranked and they didn't either and we could ask them about Ravens crag a little bit.

If is it the one that's still staggered? Yeah, then you should be able to catch him fairly easily. What they've already caught him. Okay, he did not get very far because if I if I shoot at him it's gonna be lethal damage. You do what? You don't got to do, Grayson.

Well, since you guys seem to want to catch them all just I just won't do anything.

A shoko just to be clear like you see Ochi swinging at him you have dark vision so you can see that he's like hitting them with the flat of the blade but he didn't say anything. He's not like don't kill him. Yeah, she'll go will attempt to catch up with you guys.

So if it'll let me move. Oh okay, okay foundry. Yeah, sure that's what I wanted. And that, okay, it has clipped to me out of bounds like, no longer reenter that

These windows.

I cannot see that, I only, so,

I guess Shoko will swing wildly at the air in front of him because he remembers. That's where the dude was and I'll try and do this non-lethally.

Okay up. So, not being able to see him and not only post about to 20 to hit then because we're minus 4 for being on lethal. You just can't create. Oh, okay. Which he already had three long lethal. He's got 11 HP left. He balls uncontives.

And that is everyone either dead dying or unconscious. Sochi will grab this guy and pick him up and fireman's. Carry him back over here to the fire where we can all see and he run away so easily. So since we started at 10, it's It's been four and a half hours.

Do you think we could call it there started at 11?

So we were gonna wrap up after this fight in questioning, Are you okay? Thanks sticking around for that.

You can I I kind of gotta go. Yeah, it's all good. It happens. The questioning doesn't go particularly far. Anyways, these ninja all do have the blood gears on them.

But these ones have much better gear than the last ones and I got to make a couple more four distances if you do, let me drop that in the chat again for you. So, round three.

I failed that one Another point of con damage, Round four. And this isn't one the exact reason why? No way. Yeah, anti-talk them. I was nowhere, is probably like, looking over the moment that she realizes that this poison on. Was it the blades or the belt or something? All right, yeah, so at the start of like the next one, the moment you kind of like cough a bit and you know it's obvious that you got hit by a dart.

She just comes over, pulls out. It pulls out of vial guys. Next week I got I gotta take off. Thank you. And yeah, just shows one of the anti-toxins down your throat. Just like stop being a pussy. Come on. That's mean we're at negative three or three con damage so far Round forward.

You gotta plus five to all subsequent attempts. Mm-hmm. And you make one more, save You need to make two. Is it two steps or two? Concurrent saves it. Just says, two saves. Not too concurrent. Thank God. Let me double check. I think it might be consecutive. I think it's consecutive It's probably consecutive since that's what everything else is.

Oh two more points. Two consecutive saves. Yes, it is. Okay, after I've got one way over for around acquired doesn't have neutralized poison but she has restoration. Lesser got my help and she hasn't prepared even

All right. Last one. You. All right, you

Yet for max condoms. The only thing that Noah can kind of suggest at this point is like, okay, so you're probably gonna want to stem the wound somehow and actually in her bag of tricks, as usual pulls out a bunch of other vials and it's like the problem is I'm not a surgeon.

I don't know how to fucking do that. Which is my way of saying, is anyone in the party, actually good at heal. Give me like just tosses it over. Take you take A plus 3 to your heel track. If you use the jawed from methadone skit, I got this in case I stabbed myself in the eye, go call you go alone.

All right, so for a night of rest, you are going to double your gain back. 22, We will get. You have three potions of lesser or sorry. Three scrolls of lesser restorations. Do you? Yes, we do. Let give those two koia then and she can use those cut. Oh my god.

This is bad. Yeah. Now, imagine if only Yanni had actually hit with any of her, a tags. Yeah, yeah. It's all of her weapons were coded with desk blade.

This is part of the reason why I know I get to be annoyed when Grayson's, like, oh, who gives gets down about poison? It's like you were fucking freak. You know, Yanni really should have been a much more challenging battle. He just wasn't for you guys's group because she didn't get Oh damn okay so that's four back on the first scroll.

I think you were minus six. I would like minus eight. Oh my word and there's the light but the last four I needed goddamn koia with your restoration scrolls. So, I'm gonna take it, we're taking the wand back, but keeping the scrolls and finding out who provided those and putting them on the billing.

Yes, we have them. Those are party inventory. Those are actually a party inventory. Oh, impressively done! Yeah, he's been casually. I think you guys got those in brainwall. Yes, Good always good. Keep them around. Always useful. So with zero, now dying we try and tie up and wake at the tango up, check in for the blood geos.

See that? It's there and then wake him up and ask him a question and watch him die. Anyways, that is pretty much how that will go. Yes. Yeah.

Well that's fun. Is that though? Not the word I'd use personally. Gonna say a prayer over these fools to Hey, Fang. Mmm, you wanna actually give presents to their own. God, might I suggest Yazang. It's not for them. It's for me for my conscience. Oh, that thing. Nah, you didn't and no, I will actually like move the corpsos back to the tree line and like get them out of the way.

Because there was a little bit of sarcasm, it was for them but he just does whatever God. Yeah, he thinks is appropriate and I think it seems like anyone was it. Allow super, I'll shoot up the patron for. Thank you is, hey fang? I'm pretty sure. Oh, I genuinely don't not and probably neither would know it.

You've dropped it multiple times of like that sick and now you're like, yeah, but that doesn't mean. She knows much about like how the culture actually functions. Yeah. He's the a tengu worship. A thing primarily. Don't this working like no, I wouldn't know that he's an if I'm remembering correctly.

He's a type of Oni. I think. Oh no, much more about that. He's represented as a Tangu. He's like the god of story. He's represented as a yama. Bushi tango. What is anonym? Yeah, which is one, I would not and like anything. Beyond that is like fully completely beyond her.

That is a cultural like the thing that she'd be like, huh.

Honestly, I'll never known as the the angry champion of storms. Yes. But always sounded really cool. The Duke of Thunder. Yeah, agree. No.

So, let's lose their bodies.

Very used to and some days. Sorry, I was fixing how hungerville's breath weapon and weigh in sneak attack. You're fine. I'm gonna talk show. Go in to bed rest. Now old man. You did good.

He goes to bed. He is told to go zero you alright, will you be? Well, I'll be fine. Yeah, Meanwhile, he so yeah, on the break of the oldest is over here, taking shots of vodka.

Didn't I didn't want to actually cast something he did. He's got a, he's got to get a full night's sleep now.

Did he cuss it always in his with them? No, he know. He casts. Yeah, he cast on my plush. See also Preakiest fucking shit I've ever seen. So today's meter day are all of their weapons. Poisoned like that, that was terrifying. Zeo almost died in a matter of a minute.

And we now understanding why I said antitoxin this useful, not all of them, they only had one dose so it was just on their first dart from their blowgun but now knowing like he's just commenting on it. Like that was, that's scary. I didn't realize, you know what I mean.

He's realizing like how dangerous these fights he's been and have been and he's like coil, let me get some of that. Vodka. Yo, this 17 year old is like ma'am. If I might and or except for the desk blade, there's only two doses of that. But everything else is time for and mmm.

Unless anyone stops her know, I just like I assume they're in the dots, the sort of sock expose Talks them into a. They are all loaded up and ready to be used. Took them to the inside of her hairy.

Yes, terrible things. Definitely a crime against all living. You know, man and humanity old bird or looks at zero again thing.

Read sign, what? Sorry, the crime and the entity. It's crime. Okay, you So Z what I think that you're terrible. That was terrible. That's okay.

Also gonna heal her friend while he's sleeping. Oh, I'm sure the old man will be And not being said, though, just to avoid that happening quite so badly again. Oh, cheer, you by any chance? Using a necklace of any kind. I don't think I have an X-lot. Oh yeah.

I have the armor natural armor. Oh yeah, that's probably gonna be less useful to you. Then. I mean, I'm open to it especially if I'm gonna be fighting in the front like, you know, run it by me in character because all I was gonna do is that like you remember the actually, remember your character seen it?

Probably when we were in the, the rhymers and like, no. I ripped something off of her collar and just smashed it and the charm. Yeah. There is three currently on her neck and she just pulls one of the leather chords off and throws it at you. Oh yeah, definitely.

What is it a links something charm? Yeah, it's a link sidecharm. I'll I'll put on the I'll just gift it to you in a sec for sure. Thank you. You only get to use it the once, unfortunately. Yeah, I got the tattoo and I can detect, but I feel like a lot of this is just gonna be surprised around stuff anyways, so I can detect magic for illusion if we think we're being followed somewhere, but I can't wait, you know, insta?

See invisibility or anything? Hmm. Well, I can do a couple other things, but the most important one really is gonna be that, that particular kind of divining. Yeah.

So if I might get this to you, you should hopefully not have a link sidecharm. I'm sure I do. I'll go look.

Like this. Fixed anyone have anything broken. That needs fixing think all my stuff. Everyone got your new classabilities and stuff. Added just fine. Yeah, no way. When you leveled up any ninja levels, did it automatically add like ninja trick for you or you going and selecting them as you level up, because it didn't give it to me.

And I went, and you, you have, you have to manually go in and add the trick as you. I just want to make sure I did. I didn't use any this level so far but I was like, hmm. You should be able to find most of them in the features compendium.

They did. I just was like, looking through almost like it didn't doesn't say ninja trick anywhere here. So I didn't know how. Yeah, you just, you know what I mean? Like for the the warrior poet, like the things you can select like every odd level like it doesn't have those automatically either so I kind of assumed it was like that.

Yeah. It's yeah, elective stuff. Yeah, most of the art lady aren't built up to do that and I don't think they're ever going to be. No, because I mean, you're you. Yeah. If you're getting that deep into it and doing an archetype like you should probably know and go find it yourself.

Yeah, I just realized you haven't pecked anyone forever? No, I didn't pack people and he won't O2 probably never will

He thinks that's disgraceful behavior. I was literally about to say, don't you dare come out with that? Would be dishonorable. I out oh you don't want service on training montage with grace and teaching Ochi had a peck as hard as he kicks. Now I would love to, like, learn more about how to use key with you guys because I have it now, but I haven't flavored it.

You know what I mean? I wasn't gonna bust it out just to use like dark vision or something in this fight. I was about to say. So this is the cat at, like, not the character asking. What did you actually take? I took forgotten trick first just cuz like I don't want to go to levels stuck with one thing and like I don't have a ton of key anyways so I want.

Yeah, I use whatever like we need to fix a problem like this, where people were visible, not that there's an ninja tricks that do that but like you know, to have the flexibility there and also bad. Yeah, there are. There is an indict all over. You see invisible? There is Hish Blindsense.

10 feet. Yeah, You can get that out of warrior poet as a move action later, but it's kind of blind sense for like, a short amount of time as move action, you know. Yeah, you better off doing, you get all the way to master trick. You start looking at like other things, but I never will because I'm multi-class tech.

You are kind of old. Yeah, it's you have two classes. That's not multi-class attack. I will have three. Oh no. I by the way. Abby shoot the. It is actually it's a tent bubble ninja trick called. See the unseen. What did I just say If you're asking tricks? Yes, get to master trick it is.

Yes I know forgotten trick. Doesn't let you take a master trick. It does not good god if it did. Yeah, That'll be fun. You can man. You can forgotten trick into vanishing trick though, which I don't plan on doing. But I'm like that's It's a good escape option. Yeah, if we really need to, that's why I took the some of the fugitive grenades like that'd be great.

Same deal. You know what I mean? Smoke bomb disappear into an extra dimensional space. I guess I feel like we're pretty out of character at this point. I don't think we're gonna do much else. So I was gonna ask you guys about the obsidian stuff for the wiki thing.

I have no, I don't think everybody's necessarily interested, the short version is there's two options. I wrote up a document explaining how you can get obsidian and get and get hub on your computer to where we can all update the same one and have access to it in relatively real time.

The other option is that I can publish it for like a monthly cost. Which I'm down for but obsidian has a lot of community-made plugins that are like really sick for RPG campaigns that won't necessarily translate to the website published version if I pay for it. So it'll just be this kind of wiki document with not a lot else going on, which is still great.

So I was gonna see gauge with the interest is if you guys are interested. I could take one person a volunteer to like run them through what you'd have to do to get it online. To that capacity. It's not super hard, but you I did have to do like, right?

Like three lines of code that I found in like, an article explaining it and, you know, you're opening like command window, and you feel like a hacker, I don't know what your guys's experience is, what that sort of thing, but I don't have any. So I was really intimidated at first but that's the lay on the land on that stuff.

I should have really looked into the ability to share or co-edit whatever I was making before. I invested this much time into it is basically the most important takeaway but it is a really powerful tool. If you guys want to be able to like, you know, right into it also then that's there's a there's a certain amount of time investment in that it's like me like and afternoon to figure it all out.

But now that I have I should be able to walk someone through. It fairly easily.

No. Need to respond. Now, I'll post more if you guys are interested, if not, I'll just do the published one and then we can have like the recaps and be able to like see while we're playing. You're like Kim and datsu. Who the heck is that? And you can click on the name.

And eventually, I'll have the page filled out of like Kim and Dotsy was blah, blah. They did blah blah blah. And that sort of thing.

It was fun. Yeah, I think. Oh Now I was only gonna say like my time is already fucked as it is. That's the only thing I get I do. I totally get. I'm I'm doing a lot of admin stuff for other things, um, but like I'm always down to If you need like our reference or just want something to the check someone over my background is that?

I'm I'm very much in encoding and so I'm I'm in information security so oh for sure it's really easy. It's just pushes it uses like a plugin inside of obsidian to push the vault to get hub and then other people can build the same. Like if you have obsidian with the plug in, it'll pull from that same gap It's not super complicated but I don't know nothing about that stuff.

So I had to do quite a bit of doodling, to figure it out, so it was easy and then we'd all be working on the same one and like if somebody writes something in it while we're playing you can see it. You know, that's sort of thing. It's a bully.

Hell, you have written a lot. It's actually up to date to like this to last session right now. But as you can see, if you like click on anything, most of the actual links are pretty much empty at this point, and I'd like to fill them out a little bit more.

But there's some of the plugins are like super, super sick for RPG stuff. They have like a map one where you can put like you know tokens with tags that link you to those pages and like build like a actual timeline on another one. There's just really, really powerful stuff.

I've heard people compare using this for RPGs to a thing called realm worlds that I've never used. But a lot of people like really loved and yeah. Mmm, either really powerful tools. It's just requires a lot of legwork which is fine, you know, and I don't need anybody else to like update it necessarily.

It's just, I feel like it's kind of a pain for me to like, export it. And have you import it like every time like before? Like, when's a good day for everybody to be able to look at it, You know what I mean? If you get it to the point where Amy, when I throw it up in there, it just pops into yours.

So, like the day or two, after the session, and that's a little bit more convenient for everyone. I feel like. But like I said, I could just do the published version but then I won't be able to do like the maps and the timelines and stuff like that. It'll just essentially be a text wiki.

I'll let everybody ponder on that. I might just have the maps of cool stuff online. I just wanted to see what the interest was before. I spent more time, making all that stuff. No, I'm looking at it through now, this is really neat.

You, I am always thoroughly entertained. I by people's like recapping and things. Yeah, I like lose my way between doing like first and third person and like not using certain nouns or pronouns and then using them later and then like, including the fights or not including the fights. So like the tone and the structures really inconsistent right now I mean the best thing to do is just do.

Whatever is like is it consistent enough that you A get that like you get enjoyment out of doing this? Because you know, obviously and I was cool and that people can generally follow it, Believe me. Yeah, I know where you're at. Because back when I was playing in a wolf, the crown game, I went out of my way to make.

I'm pretty sure it's still on Google sites somewhere. I'll pull it up if you really bored. My character was basically obsessive about writing a record sort of it's more of a journal and a lot of it doesn't make a lot of sense without not actively being in the game, but without like some additional information, like everybody in that game very well known NPCs, by which I mean literally like the Grand Prince of Taldor, had some sort of code name and You can work out who's, who if you're familiar with it.

Um, But yeah, now like keeping the consistent tone and stuff like that. I wrote that entire thing in his like like I'm not like a journal um sort of thing. So it like looking back on it, it probably doesn't make any sense to anybody else but trying to be consistent with, it is so hard.

I really use the restroom and my dog, just forced himself through the cat door, so something's obviously going on. Oh yeah. I think what's supposed to be going on So I hear what you're saying and like, that's why I did it. And it's already helped me just like, remember things and restructure things to, where I have a better grasp of what's going on, which is like, most of what I wanted this for, but I was like, this would be really helpful for everyone.

If we don't even want to go this route, if you guys are all like, fluent enough with this sort of stuff to just like, download the vault every time, then it's already going to that GitHub page that I linked and it updates like every time I get in there.

So if you want to know like you can just go pull it from the GitHub and it should be up to date pretty much every time.

So between sessions.

Rock and roll. I'm super stoked to be level 6. Did anybody else get? Really cool stuff. Grayson, did you get like super sick things? How do you just do the feet sizzle? Just two feets. No, big deal. You know what? I got zero feats. You got forbidden track. I can use it one time a day, don't forgot.

Yeah, forgotten. What time a day right now. I nearly took forgotten check myself and then I realized that like the key cost is pretty high. Actually, the key cost isn't a problem at all for now. Waterflex benefits of being a ninja monk. Yeah, definitely. Absolutely, yeah. So I know she's she's pretty good.

So one of the things was to do a thing that we we need someone to deal with like traps and jets. So I've sorted that out the the Nendatrack is ordinarily. I would say a very stupid idea and but no way is a very stupid person. So So out of character, this is a tiny bit revealing, if you don't want to hear it, then I shall not divulge it.

But there is, there is a fact that I've had in the back burner on Noah, since which kind of come into cow's Garden, learned some of the details And I don't want to hear. So I'll head off for the night so or not night but, no, I'm not gonna divulge like what it is.

So, just take care. Grace did So it was a thing I was like huh? I didn't think about that and now I have. So what's the thing I'm sorry? I didn't hear you. Well No, I I thought about something that we've learned as a like while we're in cow's card.

Mm-hmm. And I was like, hmm, This factors of thing. What should I do? Knowing this fact and I have now head cannons, what that fact is. So I've and that's related to my choice of ninja truck. There you go. That's fun stuff. I like obviously Ochi isn't mid-max because I'm doing like seven damage on average but you're you're like a samurai though.

So you challenge stuff and damage that's happening. Yeah. I was like when I was like, trying to run the numbers on whether or not this was going to be a waste of a character slot. I was like, I mean maybe, but like for a boss fights especially with the new order I have better will saves and much better AC against my challenge target.

So I think for like tank in Big Bads like it's a decent option to have OT stand there and get swung out as much as it is for anyone else. You know what I mean? Like I'm not like a heavy armor fighter, but I'm not Zeo standing there. Getting, you know, hit by like the Tetsubou, we are collectively.

A very agile party. Yeah, super dextrous. But yeah, I was surprised by like the challenge. Damage was like, wow, this feels so much better. Like I it's really painful to watch Grayson, just disintegrate somebody from across the map and then walk up to that same person and try and hit him into like five.

I mean Grayson's. Entire thing is that he's he's resign optimal. That's, that's a complete sentence. I imagine he like closes his eyes and just fires like four arrows like the where they're so fast. They almost like line up behind each other and just sink into somebody. Yeah. If I recall he's not actually like that.

Dextrous the dude is just doing doing the wisdom thing. So he's being very efficient and that's like a totally viable way to play. Yeah, he he fires a lot of arrows, but the moment someone uses protection from arrows, right? Yeah. Somebody uses wind wall or snatching. Exactly. Like there's, there's problem So he month leaps at them and kicks him in the face.

Yeah. But he's got to actually monthly and do that and if I recall can Zen arches, even flurry of blows but they can still fury blows but still glory. It was. Yep. It's interesting interesting. Yeah, I mean they don't lose period blows with their fists. They just get confirm, you blow with their with a bow.

Yeah. And well I'm really liking the current party makeup. I think it's going really well. Sorry, again for stepping on, like, ninja toes. I just wanted, I want to flavor it as less like sneaking attack and more. You know, he's just like really precise with where he's doing a stab and I won't be ninja for too many more levels.

I just want to get that key pool, dude, you you are not stepping on any ninja toes. If anything I feel bad. Because unfortunately she says um at least at the moment Noah's characterization is that she's kind of a bitch and it's annoying for me to try and find ways to like keep truth to her kind of chaotic nature.

While also, you know, not being an asshole and I'm hoping that I'm kind of getting out the ideas is that I get, you know. She yeah we'll stop. Yeah, that's the other thing with this. Huge document thing is I want to get myself more into the fiction. So I want to lean more into the character.

I'm having trouble doing the lawful good thing OG's. Kind of drifted somewhat from like his original character concept mostly because of like the party makeup and like the backstory that I came up with after building him out and I'm like okay that doesn't make sense with like who he is and what happened to him and stuff.

So I'm just trying to make him more realized and act that a little better. Yeah, it's usually what happened? Those days you come up with an idea and then you bring them to a table and as with anything, no plans, survives first contact, with the party. So just kind of flex into what you kind of want to be or what makes the most sense.

Yeah, No and I think I definitely want like an alignment shift towards neutral like part of the the samurai order that not the Samurai in the Cavalier ordered. But I mean, same thing it's a time. Yeah, for like being the first line of defense against like the Oni. And in this case, for the, the royal family.

Like he's, it says, right in? Like the very first flavor text block of the order that it's like, they don't give shit about good, or evil or, right, or wrong. They just want to protect the state of the world from the supernatural forces that would seek to destroy it.

And I'm like, that's what he would do. He would see this threat of the only of the five storms and see Amako and be like, I have to stop this. That's my job. Now, you know, yeah, that's like super red. And I think that's like a good thing to have as a as a samurai because Samurai Cavalier any other kind of class combination that gives you an order.

Like having that thing is like, it's your equivalent to the paladin code of conduct, right? Yeah. So, develop the character. Exactly. Exactly. Gives you like a framework to kind of be like, no matter what this is. This is the thing. Yeah, I was like, I always was like, kind of playing with the idea of like switching it, but then as soon as Sans was like, oh Mako just like nights you on the spot.

I was like, fuck this advances my character development so fast and so far. Yeah, that's like super cool because it was fun. Yeah. Anyways. Sorry, I'll chat all day about. OG I'm terrible like that because I have no one in my real life to talk to you about it.

Yo you too. Yeah, mood. Yeah, big mood. Yeah. Big made Ben I can I can talk like stuff like that. I love hearing about how people like want to move their characters through things and who actually have an interest in the roleplay side of it lonely. Yeah, I mean like the way, the way that I came into it was like I played a little bit before but then I started listening to all these actual play podcasts and they just like scratch this itch that I didn't know that I had.

And a lot of them. Just do like fantastic roleplay and backstories and I'm like fuck. That's so cool, man. Like, if I wanted to play a video game, I go play a video game and look at big numbers, you know, I wanted. Yeah, I want to exactly do a character concept and that's super like, fun and cool.

The original one was more of like a sneaky leaning more into the Tango-ness of like stealing and like gaslighting everyone around them about the stealing, you know, it was gonna be like a maroku-esque character from like Inuyasha with his like little staff. He's just oh, yeah, you know, and then like pull out like all these hidden weapons and just like go hard in the paint whenever there was a fight and then just go back to being like, oh, this is really cool.

I'm gonna take this. They're like no, he's like, this is Tango tradition. You're supposed to give me a gift and then now he's like this level. Good child. Who has lost the sassy lost child? Um, yeah no, I love Archie. I think. I think he's like he's really from my perspective, he's really fun to play off.

I have a lot of fun just thinking, like, wow, this this dude is just naive enough. Yeah, and I wanted to believe in the goodness of all things and I am just cynical enough to be like found. Yeah I think it's really fun and that's why I want to get into the fiction of it more is I think he's a really good foil for like the uncaring Grayson and like the ultra like selfish and chaotic no way and the like old and like bitter shoko.

You know what I mean to have this kid following him around or like takes himself really seriously? Because of Mako was like I don't give a shit about tradition. You're a samurai now, you know, like Yeah, like the narratively, the role that I would want to, to make, you know, I kind of go down.

I already kind of know where she'll end up being probably very quickly. You guys wrap up. The frozen shadows is the.

Okay, this is the only way I can really describe it in short term. So in the, in the fall flowing future of whatever she survives. All of this. I'm hoping that she's the kind of character that is look, you you don't ask me for help or anything because I probably already done the thing.

Mmm, you know? Yeah. She's like I I really want to make sure that the people I like and the people that I genuinely love all protected and the length that I will go to ensure that are vicious like secret service level get down, Mr. President while I shoot this guy in the head, Like that's a reducer or anything but like a black widow sort of character art where Yeah, it's really reductionist but it is kind of.

But yeah, it does apply though. I think the only difference is that, at least the kind of the the MCU renditional Chicago, at the very least, is much more moral. Yeah, no way is not and she's not designed to be. If anything perspective on whether or not you should kill someone, or is very much colored by like, look, if you're not alive, then you're no longer really a problem.

Unless you come back as a dead thing in which case if I just hide you, well enough, you probably won't be able to come back as a dead thing, and if you do, it won't be anywhere near anyone. I care about. Yeah. That's so some fun flavors right there.

Yeah. She's, she's supposed to be that kind of mentality, but there is there is like an angle, um, about her. That hoping will have a chance to come out. Because At the very bit, like off, coming off of the back of Brandall. If a party hadn't interacted nearly as like as much and didn't react as they did to, like, by the way, kind of kind of an indigo assassin.

That was supposed to kill your boss, kind of thing, The whole kimon Dotsu. I will come in of colder, ally thing. Yeah. No. I would have kept swinging. Mmm, interesting. So so that is character development, that's not me as the player being like I'm not gonna do this because that fuck your your party over.

We were just all being like generally kind to you a little bit like asking these questions. It's like seeming to give a shit about you. And then you're like these people are kind of nice to me. I think our killed yet More importantly. At least, from Again, I'm being incredibly sappy here.

But from hope perspective, every single time she's had to tell somebody her real name, she's had to kill them and that's not a like oh no. Now I have to kill you thing. It's a that's that's the best sentence thing. And the only people that have ever known her name have been people that she's hated mmm, like genuinely fucking hated.

Nobody has pretty much everybody who's called her Hatsuyuki has plus how to track record for some sort of abuse against her. I would imagine I don't and she is like, okay, like, as my name, it's my background. This is Michael on. I'm assuming that, you know, this information you will want me.

Get. Yeah, I mean like, as a as a rule, that's pretty much what's happened every time. Right. There was some extra cool stuff that I hope we get to learn about just to mentions and like I made they're in the wiki and everything and they're just floating because if you go to the little cool graph view, I have like 12 or 14 dots or so, they aren't connected anything.

And like half of them are just from no ways like character back. I want to know I need these right to connect to other things. So I guess if These are not just going to be random facts, you probably will have like just talked with no about at some point.

Maybe so, you know they're not hidden or anything. Just might have had this conversation over dinner or something or ask Um over Innobushi wine, an individual wine. Exactly. And remember she yeah we we stand plum. Wine in this house is the like If you ask if you ask a you know she's she's responded generally speaking.

Yeah, I'm I'm predominantly erotucky Tian. If you ask what type of Tian she looks at you blank and goes, I have no idea a gathered that. Yeah, yeah. So I think she's like I think my father was somewhere in Honggol which suggests Tian like on. Yeah. It's it's probably not though, because my name is written in Tianshu.

But my name itself is Mikayan Very concealed for us who are like from Chancho like, you know, exactly. And and this kind of leads into like my name is haiku and you're like clearly like Chinese and not just yeah, she's she's she's some amount of amalgamation of she's either Tianju or Mankayan or John Hamp.

Like it's one of those ones. I basically just put flappy hands. I'm gone. Hey, like the ancestry is Medgayan. But that was like 1500 fucking years ago house, right? Yeah, so not relevant to me really at this point. Exactly, exactly. And There is a tiny bit, a little bit, a little bit of a ego but is like half a very, very good reason for why I want to kill all of the frozen shadows in cows.

God, is not even because it's a good idea. It's because when they ask about the first and shadows clan, I get to say that's me. There's one that is really sick. That's a badass character. That's that's one. No, he's going for. She's like you want to talk to the frozen shadow?

That's me. Yeah. The frozen shadow Because once you because she'll admit they have agents all over in the Innocity but their agents. Oh, so they probably don't actually know like any of the ninja techniques or anything. No, So performance and stuff like that. Exactly. So the moment that this is cleared out and you kill them at the root, they're on a morphos and shadows, except for me, the only true frozen shadow.

That's super sick, right? It's so incredibly stupid. And She's like, I am the one. There could be only one. You can be only one that's that is honestly like, it's the dumbest thing. And it wasn't really something that I had in her characterization until we came to Calsguard and just started fucking around.

And I was like, okay, we've now decided that she's actually like Big C chaotic As opposed to like, little see that it was supposed to be. Yeah. When you were like, yeah, I'm not gonna go that far in. And then you like did the whole Rye burner skill, like, without us.

I was like, oh, yeah, this is, this is good to go bad at some point One day. This is. Okay. So So here's here's the tea with that because I know that some people made some certain large explorations of air. I went like that. Could have gone really bad.

You know Like yes, Yes, I know that madness But unfortunately I have played Pathfinder for 20 Well 3.5. So If I think this character can get away I probably can. Yeah. If there's anyone character that could get away really easily is the ninja too. You can vanish your way out of there.

Key points, get the speed and just and just disappear. Yeah just disappear climb up a fucking wall. Like do something just has acrobatics out. They asked to at least run like yeah, one of the cool things made for doing it just stuff. One of the cool things I wanted to do with OG is like flavor.

Some of the key is like him learning from Grayson in a way either like with their help or just like watching and discovering that in himself. But one of the other ones I got psychic, sensitivity is a bonus feat from my order but I also got like knowledge planes and knowledge Arcana.

And there's like all kinds of cool stuff you can do with knowledge plan. So I'm like debating taking flickering step like very very late game just for like utility which I think of you can have also being debating flickering. Yeah you know what I mean? Like just utility of like he can see through the planes.

Like he's like another level of like knowing about the supernatural world just like we need to get the fuck out of here. Everybody grab hands and we all just teleport like not because he's like powerful just because like he knows you know like the right place to like just step through existence.

Yeah. No, I mean if no way survives long enough, I am fully intending that she is going to be like when you think of. So in traditional media, when you think of the ninja, you think of like Oh these people who like our known for assassinations and sneaking into places and being able to kill you in your sleep and that kind of thing, right?

But there's also the other angle of it where people where you can like When ninjas often disguise themselves as certain like commoners or you know Geisha in order to get themselves into a position of particular interest. And yeah um like that side of it is actually no way especialty if you what you ask her.

She's like, I am very good at killing people, but the thing that I was trained to do is get information, which is why. Um, if you use a disguise you toll like any kind It automatically, get a check against it. Mm-hmm. So that's the frozen shadow archetype, right? Yep.

Yeah, I looked at it because I was like, you know, you get the pathfinder disease of like how could I make the most unique character to ever live? And you just stack archetypes on archetypes. And like so I went through all of them. Yeah, no. They the frozen shadow rocketype I would actually argue is pretty bad though.

It definitely is. But you don't see me trying to be a frozen shadow ninja. I'm like, if you have the right circumstance of the prior knowledge of like, what the campaign or like the, you know, whatever you're running is gonna be like, obviously. All skills are useful in certain situations but like in the Pathfinder mathy sense, like they're not great abilities.

Yeah, losing uncanny. Dogs sucks like it, just deals. I didn't think that was gonna be as large of a worry as it's, it's a huge problems campaign. Fucking yeah. Late. Getting getting flanked is like super fucking for me but conversely, I don't intend to be in a position where I ever will be caught out like that.

Yeah, it's oh she's not gonna do any invisibility stuff. But warrior poet. One of the elective abilities is get uncanny Dodge and then also dipping it a ninja. So I could stack them and get them as if I was, you know, a ninja of whatever level. Unfortunately, the bill doing two up and fighting as you know his feet intensive.

So like, you know, getting into those things, it's a little less fee intensive. The problem with warrior poet is that warrior poet is built to do. It's it's built for vital strike. Yeah. That's why I'm like kind of ditching out of it. When I am, like, I want to lean into the key stuff to boost the damage instead of relying on doing that one trick.

Like obviously like spring attack is really great if you don't want to get hit but I just I didn't want to stay 16 or 18 levels of like this one doing this specific thing in combat every time. Yeah especially if you do with like a magnada, I think it's way better or a glaze.

Yeah, it is. You know what it means? Like it's just the build doesn't even really work unless you're using a big fat weapon like that. Yep. So it's like I'm gonna do other things and I've changed my mind on it like a million times. Like now dude, I got this point your conversation today about what fucking like ninja tricks.

I was going to take at level six and I was like, oh, we're leveling to six. And I'm like yeah, at this point like what I want OG to be able to do is to just try and keep up on damage with everybody else and I'm gonna take bar and brawler and use that in combination with forgotten trick to just try and be good at whatever we're dealing with at the time.

And otherwise have like critical focus. And that enough to weapon fighting feeds, it was pretty baller, especially with them. But the elephant in the room yeah it works out a lot better without having to have all the improved feats to do everything Dear God. Yet us There would be no way on this planet.

That no way would have been built to be empty monk. Yeah, and I still want to talk to Shoko about it because I haven't, but I wanted to do this. Wash dip. Also just to get Perry and repost because I think that's like exactly the kind of thing. The Ochi would do, you know what I mean?

But yeah, like I see, I see kind of where you're at and

The thing I would normally suggest I can't suggest because you're a samurai ordinately. In this case, I would have gone, You could go swash, or you could go Cavalier daring champion, but you obviously can't. Yeah, unlimited myself. But I mean, Maybe he died. I've already got a backup like that could, you know, weigh down the road as we get closer to Tianjah could take over.

But like, it's taking care of, by the seal, but I would much rather like the character die if it's not working or if like he actually dies. Oh yeah. There's like a good narrative cut off. Like that would be like I I'm always for the narrative and like, okay player enjoyment is king, you know?

Yeah. And disability dies like defending a mako in the quest to get her two Ming Kai like 10 out of 10, you know what I mean? Even if it's not cool like I'm gonna I'm gonna make it cool in my head. Like, yeah. That's that's like, the best way to kind of look at it.

And and those situations And yeah, if your character doesn't work out, then it doesn't work out. I'm gonna be honest, I wasn't entirely sure now is was going to work out because frankly I didn't know whether or not the party was going to just be all like all right, you dead?

I don't know. That's a tough one. I don't know. I haven't been enough games. I've there's a really funny moment in one of the actual plays that I've listened to where they're like deep in a dungeon when somebody dies and the way, they introduce another character like it's just really hilarious but the one of the original characters, but not that ones was like, I have all these questions for you.

How did you get here? Who are you? And can you cure blindness? And then the guy who's introducing the new character is, like, I'm gonna answer those in reverse order. I can't care blindness. And then the original person was like, kill him immediately. Yeah, there's like those moments are hilarious.

Yeah, I I definitely did those moments for sure. I am. I'm a big proponent of I guess at the narrative and just player enjoyment and having fun with it. And I definitely feel like a I talked too much and my games like collectively you and me both, I think these other people, they are a little bit more here for the hack and slash.

So I try and roll it back to a point where we're just trying to move the story forward, you know, I mean like I want to get my my character notes in because that's how I enjoy this. But like, you know, I want to get to the fight so that Grayson isn't like why the hell am I paying to do 15 minutes?

Yeah fight, but it takes four hours of my day. You know what I mean? Yep. Yeah. I do. I I definitely understand that for sure. It's, it's kind of rough to balance that out. I mean, I got a lot of enjoyment out of roleplay. Stupid shit. That's why when you guys were fighting the ocher jelly, I was like, I ain't doing dick the way over here, double Dover and dying with Koya.

The way, when I like that was probably one of my favorite moments that I've done in this campaign so far is when Joka was like, no, you're supposed to throw rocks is like, don't I came up here so that I could tank it with my major images and I just stepped back and shot it with the two there.

Oh, it's like, yeah, you got it. Go for it. Yes, which is why I was just like I am not fighting a giant pudding. Yeah, No I just didn't have much self-respect at all and she has no concept of shame frankly. But That one was like my mind. I am not fighting.

I walking. I'm not home. That's you in the tapioga. Could go out at alone. Yeah. Yeah. You can you in the tofu can have a good fight over there. I am not touching that problem. Anyways, I could ramble all day. It's always nice talking to you about this stuff.

Like I think you and I are on a very similar page and what we're enjoying about this campaign and what like we could chat about. So glad to having probably good for a while. But yeah. Sorry to sorry to keep you man. No, you're good. I'm just I'm hungry.

I didn't need enough breakfast. Today food is important. You should definitely. My girlfriend is like eight and a half months pregnant right now. So I have to feed her also or she'll relations. Thank you. We're super, super excited. We're making a main character. We're naming him wolf game. So oh my god, amazing.

Yeah, right. Super stoked about that. I gotta build a grill like this weekend. Well, honestly, my best to look for that and congratulations to you both. I hope everything goes well But yeah, Duke get some food. It is. It's good time. Thanks. I'll see you around. See you next week later did
