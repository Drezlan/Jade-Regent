Subtypes ogres are particularly resilient and that's regeneration that can only be stopped with acid or fire. They have a number of at-will spells including darkness and visibility. They are also capable of casting charm. Monster Kona, Cold Deep Slumber and gaseous form Christ. He also has a named Tetsuo with her and now that her glamor is gone, you also see a large composite lung bow.


Who boom. OG. So Kevin Dotsu, did they pull out the Tetzego? Oh yeah. She stood up with it, okay? He's gonna roughly share those. That's an only an ogre. It, it can heal. We'll need to use fire or acid to kill it. These technically plat-footed. Yeah, she has enacted.

Oh, I wasn't ready for that. Oh my god. I'm sorry. So it's beautiful. You know, just all this nobody wants you, he says to you as you step up to her said, nice try kid. Yeah, We were prepared for you this time.

Is that why the boss is currently huddled in a room? Like a coward. If you fighting for her life here. Let's shoko Chuck was fine. Is she though?

So we family to do anything to this lady, like I'm just keeping her here. She regenerated it on her turn. So, swing number one. Well boom. You is a hit swing. Number two, and the bleed, even now flat. But it was a hit Derek. So, I do not get my, my sneak attack on this one because I am not lucky anymore.

Very sad.

I was a fortunate. That's fine because yeah it at the end of that like Klangs both sores together and doesn't just vanishes two can play this game. Oh, did you miss the part where she's can see you? Uh yeah. You didn't mention that top to, he said hello students.

I was prepared for you this time. Um, bitch. This is kind of a sorry I should be doing this in the voice, right? This is kind of a fucked up situation here. If you're able to say, why do we doing this?

You will have to deduct like whatever the bleed and the thing is then because most naked attack doesn't apply. Oh, Yep. Because I'm not blanking. And if it visibility doesn't work, then none of it works. So and I have learned that now and had I learned that I probably wouldn't have done the second attack but you know, it's okay, it's okay.

All right, everyone's number is really should be.

Liqueur.

I,

Oh wait, now that I there is one thing I could have done. I suppose You might want to roll to see whether or not hit the shadow image.

Oh, that's that's for fair. One is her to is the shadow glue. You hit her almost want to say that. Put it out on the second attack. Actually, that is within five. So it per it bursts, the shadow clone. I feel useful. You're being very useful. Oh, what did call you do that?

He's just still had to selected. That was for the shadow clone one. Yeah, but it is her turn now. It is up bum pum clear? It's going to activate. They think it's only.

Yes. Oh, agile. Feet and five, footstep.

A stupid blinking. Well, she misses She doesn't have flanking because it's a ninja he missed. Anyways. Yeah. But boom, a swing this thing. Thank you for reminding me. Uncanny dodges. Okay. Yes, she won't attacks. I will attempt to carry the first one foolish. I do not hurry the first one and then I take a crit.

Oh wow. I think that works.

Um, oh my god, it without me.

That is so much damage times 3. Well, it was nice playing Shoko. I guess though. Minus 12 from that. Why is that buff on there against?

Do I have anything?

Oh wait. I have that's I could do dodging panache instead.

That really know how swatch booklets worked off the top of my head you. Yes. So, you would take the hit but you prevent the crap if you did dodging, right? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, seems like this movement does not negate. The attack is so resolved as if the swashbuckler had not moved from the original scare.

Oh, provides a dodge bonus Again. You seriously? So you get a plus six to your 24 bringing up to a 30. So, yeah, you would just take the 23 instead of the 73, but it's only against, is it only against the triggering attack? I think it's only against the triggering attack.

Yeah, it's not the rest of the round. It is just the triggering attack. Yeah. So you only gets in the gate, the crate.

Which would still drop me because I would still take 22 from the first attack. And on 23 from the second attack, did not dead. You're not pulp.

And she regenerates more. I'm sorry. Hold on. You would use dodging panache, you would move five feet the first attack would resolve. And then you'd be five feet away If she has reached against a wall, okay? I got you, I can only five foot step. Oh yeah. Cuz this person went in the way over here, I got you.

Yeah, so we're saying he uses dodging financial on the second attacks, in the gate, the crit and survive. I see, I was a little bit behind. I was like reading up on this watch. Oh still, you know pictures move to your new square. I can't. It's all. I mean move.

Oops, Mickey, I wasn't even move because you're down now. I hate it.

I'm the fact that you've survived as long as you are, you have is absolutely phenomenal. Like not no word of a lie. I am both in character and out genuinely impressed.

Bringing us to Shoko's turn. So I make a fourth save, right Constitution. Check.

You stabilize, you are not dying. All right.

Face in. I will take three shots at only oh, inspire courage goes down. Ah, good point. Oh yeah, you don't have lingering here.

Oh my

I don't think that's gonna confirm the crit against here though. It unfortunately does not confirm the crate, but Lord. Are there a lot of crits in this fight and then I'll take a 5 foot step back.

Excellent. The completely uninjured guard.

Takes a swing it. Oh, gee and Mrs. Hell yeah. She has done nothing this battle but survive ziko. So, Zeo is going to literally go with Pat good good with belt at the, you got this one trap to it and he's like, I think the time I use this as he, he literally hits her with a

Nice wand. We love us some automatic damage in this house, boom.

Boom.

What's it? She fucked, just bleed damage happen. At the beginning of your turn. Yes. Well, she's not bleeding. Oh, she's not bleeding, right? Not bleeding. But yes, it does. So she's still alive at one HP. Boom.

All right, the

The boom.

15 20.

To speed of 40, right? Yep, and a 26 beats your CMD. Correct. I know. Beats quite as yeah. Yeah, so she looks like she's running Ochi.

Okay. What should show I was gonna add you saw choco drop but there's a garden between you and him. Yeah. So we gonna attack that guard. I believe, Let me have survey a little bit here. Oh me Annie's behind me. Actually, I could go over and attack her and then Chocoble will be turned into paste but she'll could go and attack her show.

You would be abandoning sugar shoko has the same. I mean, okay, here's what we're gonna do. Rough flavor it a little bit. We're gonna attack the guard. Nearest shoko. First, Let's see. Let's see here.

Just do me a favor and just move five feet up. If you're gonna do this, I have a plan. Although, that's it. Okay. With that done. He was hoping he was super strong that she would drop. But oh she has noodle arms Only when he doesn't have any pack.

Oh wait. Technically it one. Last damage right now because oh, you're inspired her. Oh, yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. I was trying to do multiple things and like, Adam modifier to my attacks for defensive fighting and stuff. And it was my turn too soon, So she didn't go down.

So he's gonna move right here and he's gonna shout at Kim and Dotsu and be like, you'll find me a lot tougher than he was Stand and fight. Just a really clearly. Look, you too. Oh, she I'm trying to save your life. Shut up. Stop moving.

And that's pretty much gonna be Ochi's turn.

All right. How close were those attack rolls? By the way? Because I was trying to do multiple things and I was gonna put on the fight defensively. There. AC is 18 Okay, I know that's meta but I'm gonna throw on the buff and say those were minus one each so that his AC is a little baby.

Oh wait a minute. Why is it the squeezing buff on

Squeezing enough. You don't need the squeezing bath bun. Do I don't have squeezing with. Yeah, you have the splitting by this for building.

Is true. I don't have it marked as on I just turned around for you. Oh, and I must have had that on for so long. Yeah, it was on your attacks, too. So you had plenty of wiggle room on those attacks. I must have clicked the wrong one. That's from back in.

That was back from the boat. Yeah. Boom. I'm sure he must have clicked the wrong box, recently. No way. Okay, so my defensive locker Zashi, I'm actually gonna draw and hey remember that poisoned shuriken the didn't land anywhere that I still have? Yeah.

Hey, you forgot something. A so yeah I I don't think it was like a plus or anything. No way whips out a sticker machine and prints out. A sticker that says address was undeliverable and throws it on the Shirley kid and then throws it only before you actually roll for this because this is gonna be more of a cinematic thing.

You say hey you forgot something and throw that at her and she snatches it out of the air with little fingers and says, thank you.

I hate you know that, bro. Yes, those feats, I'm sorry. She's had them from the beginning. It's true. It's true but it's okay. I have more.

So okay, you get to keep that one. I don't. Yeah, I exactly. So I do actually have tend that I can keeping in my wrists the entire time but no, none of the supplies. I just want to hate you. I said don't even care. Um, you because next time she's gonna be even more prepared.

Yeah. Yeah. I know how this works. That's snowball. Fucked her day though. Fucking snowball magic missiles hit. Fuck her up to the magic missile sitting for 11 damage. That was nice, but you're like, 35 damaged crates snowball, that turned the tide, So I don't have it on here, but Then it doesn't exist.

You're a liar. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's gonna mess Unfortunately as yeah, that's unfortunate. But that's fine. Because So that was the first role. That's your first one that she catches out of the air. Yeah, the first one go out there. That's the second. You didn't you didn't roll for the first one.

There is no point in rolling for it. It was gonna call even if it crept, it was gonna get caught. Yes, So totally fine which is, is still not a problem because I know throw them on danger again first and then the poison one. Well, I did want to give that back to my master and I was just that was just very nice of you then.

Yeah. Well you know, you have to keep up appearances and fordeal relationships. She says, as she takes a five foot step and uses that second walkers actually, like and just slashes straight through this person if she can. Um, so and you may be going well, where is this next attack come from?

And he points. Yeah, because I can do the I can do the grayson thing, but this one gets the full whack.

Oh my

So so that is more key points spent and I believe that's my entire turn At that point. Yep. Yep. I am down one lucky. I'll pick it up. And oh yeah. On a step. Here she is going to spend two channels to switch cast or move cast, general energy.

Above back. I'll take, I'll take 16 health. She can only exclude four people.

She doesn't have to exclude the ogre because the ogres full health. That's true. What when did the over? Oh, it's fast healing so she can exclude the three who are already down and Omayani or exclude all four of the guards and let Omani get healed. What do you guys think?

Or just exclude me. Okay. You are still full health to know you. Yeah it's interesting go ahead and exclude. Okay, yummy.

Probably. All right. So, the blind guard gets healed.

The three that are currently unconscious bleeding out, do not get healed and no neither does only honey. Boom. It's been a while since I've played Pathfinders and forgetting that it's include. Not exclude for this one. Yeah, I have that backwards at the end of my second drink and I don't usually drink.

So I feel great. Boom.

Oop.

Oh, she's gone. Oh, that's nice. You vanishes from site coward. No. Remember what you said Ochi she can go invisible. That's right. So which I squint. She's still standing right there. He had shifted down in size.

But she does hop over here and open this door, but she has to go over the desk. So that's our movement down, boo, boo Shoko.

Um, Shoko will attempt to cast defensively while on the floor because he's assuming that she's is she still right next to me? No. Okay, then she'll go will stand up and she's actually shrunk so she doesn't have any reach anymore Back here. Kevin dancer Shoko will stand up and our showdown will be on the snowy clips.

And we'll cast a mirror image.

I get two images. Yay.

And that will be showcase term already. Grayson, please do not let the ninja get away with step. For I can take the ninja out on my turn, too, and we'll take three shots. Yeah guys.

It feels like racial profiling somehow the ninja. He does not actually escape. This is a blue lives matter situation. It's a profession, not a race. You can take off your ninja outfit at the end of the day, any overkill arrows will go to the guard that just got healed.

So the first arrow gets smacked away. As it's beginning with new round, the second arrow. That's refresh on her turn though. No, because they use up a tax opportunity or no, I'm thinking of something else. You are thinking of something else because it uses a text of opportunity, it comes off of the top of the term.

So it's on her around, they reset. And because I already ated by giving her back, a shirt can Totally the first one. The first one actually dropped her and the second arrow can go to the guard, but the third arrow will miss the guard. Even flat footage and wait, no.

She's blind. Hold on. A 14. Hits are exactly.

Nice. And that's the end of Grayson's train.

He boom. Oh, you know, I can see her then Zeo still has glitter dust.

Yeah. So like or if you over here, what you go to, which no, it is pointing her sword out like this direction and is not that game Foundry. Please stop. I'm not exploding goodness gracious. Go ahead and cast another episode glitter dust Since we were pointing that way. And shouting something very obscene in Tian.

What does she sell in Tian? We most of us speak it. We would like to know, get back here motherfucker, I still want to feed you. My sword. So yeah, you have to drop that here. Right. You can't see those squares over there. I can one here. You have the movement to get further in.

And I guess I could move still move further.

But I can see they're like this square right here.

This. She becomes visible again and then both of us make will saves.

To build. He's fine, you're fine.

She's sort of visible. She's covered in glitter. Oh, bring us to OG. Oh, could you take the the dead guy that's underneath me? I'm like behind.

Okay, Thank you <.

Feel for your challenge target. So I don't play this very well normally but Ochi is lawful good and he's really doesn't want to let all of these people die. Well, yeah. But we know that this ogres is our main enemy and she's just announced her intention to kill us at a later date and now she's running away.

Okay, yes, that's fair. I will want to chase her down primarily so she's through the door through the room in there. Um, can I run through Shoko? I can pass through friendly squares of their up and alive, right? Yeah. Okay.

Oh, I didn't expect her to be like fully right there. Battery further. No, she had to go over a desk or her movement with cut down. Yep. So then we are going to Katsune's, Mystique faint.

I'm assuming that doesn't work.

We're gonna take a swing.

How's that do? That will hit. Where you going?

We're not done.

We are done for now.

But I'm sorry. Hold on. Let's pause for a second. Is she visible? He's covering glitter dust. Oh, okay. That that functions as visible enough, there's no concealment or anything like that. Yeah, okay. Good. Sorry, she was just visible on the map. So I was like pretty sure she was invisible.

Okay, that's pretty much my turn.

Bringing it to no way.

Who I mean, would ordinarily like to get to run? Stop here, but I'm pretty sure I probably won't be able to like, can I attempt a robotics like through that? I don't think I can even on the double move, right?

Will you five? And no you don't have it. Enough movement left. That's a pity. I think he got a key.

There's a yes but involved in that sentence. I'm in.

Sure, why not? This is my former boss. It's not like I'm why? Why bother that? If I use my movement speed to increase by an additional 20 feet as a double move, I should have enough there, right? Yeah.

Time to time to roll men on acrobatics, folks. Y'all already maybe, maybe don't target shoka with my attacks. First, that might be a good idea. She hit the last available moment. How much potash do I have left? You have like six bro, you have plenty. Oh um, where would you like to be?

Ah like hey. No way. Backflips through the planes and lands right there. Just just like comes it's the same situation again, where like choco is a 10, a white side. Like showcas watching from the back and porn. Orchie is like in front. He's that he's ready and then like no ways fucking foot just appears on his shoulder.

You, that's beautiful. Just all right. Are you invisible against her? That is an excellent question to, which I do not have an answer currently. So going to assume that I'm just, he does smile when you land in front of her, he seems to be thoroughly enjoying herself. Oh, come on.

You've not been put through the wrenches and swats last time. My old man was around here. You'll be fine. Probably, It has been some time since I fought opponents who were worthy

Hi. But that enters,

And just a losing which is Honestly impressive. Am I losing?

Looks at the only bane Wakazashi here with that. All of your friends will die, Dude. I should have been hitting her with only being this whole time.

He said that if you attack me with that, all of your friends will die and one of her hands kind of coales with ice.

There's another smell, like, ability that that only ogres have.

And sold there. There is like a very cautious. Look for now. She's she's holding up this sword in her and her off hand and is like, and then very slowly. Very purposefully, you see her put the sword back at its scabbard and takes a 5. Footstep and is like, We'll meet on the mountains.

I Good choice.

Choco take here. There's wounds.

And then in true Wuja evil villain fashion. She takes off flying like feet. Not off the ground. Oh here you can take exact opportunity Did I what language did she say all that stuff to no in beyond? No.

You let her off, yeah.

That she takes a double move and it flies off into the air and no way. You see worlds, take off from a rapid from the railing on the stairs outside following her.

No, I just kind of looks looks down and cried on gives the most luck a days of cool salute. It's like, don't worry. That's the very first and last of my mercy.

A little surprise, you went for it.

Oh, that person directly or indirectly, basically made sure that I didn't get killed during a bit of a family feud. So, all right. So, As for loot, I assume you don't let the guards die since they were just doing their the job. They were hired for. Oh yeah, if she runs you, oh, she's gonna run back around and trying to do heel checks and administer healing to them.

Boom, you save people. Let me remove her potion, because she drank that in the meantime, because no, I just go up and grab like, apparently these stooges that were nearby. And it's like I Where's the arcady lady. What about Amayani? Do we try and save her? Oh, she's going.

No. Oh, gee is going to If you do that. No, I will go over and literally stand her luckazashi on. Only on he's not that's fine. If she decides, she wants to try and run away or attack us right away. Then Ochi won't interfere because he understands that like she's gonna help try and like kidnapp or kill a mako like over and over and over again but she's he is hoping that she does not do that.

So I don't actually move my token for that. It was just still, well, they do, if he was up to you now, I

She failed in our missions, spectacularly. Oh gee says after that She was still hot, all right? That is dilute from the sound of dogs are making. I'm assuming the people who are visiting the house or here though, I should probably bounce. We will deal with the questioning of the merchants next game.

He do have information for you. Hell yeah. Awesome. Congratulations guys, that could have gone so much worse And we're all level six now. Yeah, nope. Five. Damn it. I was fully expecting at least two people to die. When one of the saw that that thing went full onion. I was like, oh oh that's a problem.

I wanted to die. When they what that chick. Credited me with a creeper? Yeah. Yeah. There was so many crits, human not to use fucking Hetsubou crit. Jesus. Yeah, you actually nearly just deleted my character from full health. That was insane. They that would they were so rude and her construction.

They gave her improve critical days. Right. Okay, I got to bounce. You guys are awesome. I would see you all later Next time. Yep. See. So yeah, just a couple quick questions, if no way is still over here by the body, How the hell do you keep doing the invisible thing?

Explain. Oh, it's actually quite simple. All you like like sign language with your hands and then you're invisible. What gives? So a part of basic Ninja series, the ability to manifest your key externally. You've seen other people be able to do Grayson. I know is able to do it through the manifestation of this youth.

It's not a way that it used today. Is that how he kicks so hard with his legs? Is that you can run like 80 feet in a second. I'm very fast to do with the kicking and you guys are both way faster. It has a little it has a little bit to do with the kid.

Um, you have to admit. It is a little freaky but I in my case most of my training came from internal alchemy, but it's something that you can learn to cultivate over a period of time. If you are sensitive to that sort of skill, it's to be quite honest.

Vanishing trick is one of the easiest other box on this. That I could read a lie. You've got a sudden interest that ninjas. I I want to learn how to do this kind of stuff, but I learned best from reading and like out of character that's just like how he likes to learn everything but you know, he practices like with his sword and like meditates like in the mornings and stuff like that.

So he'll actually do a physically. I'm just trying to set up a oh yeah just learning how to use a key for next level, next sense. Well, no. Would that just kind of blink a little? And she's like, well, I certainly didn't learn it from books. We we had mantras and that was a certain set of tenants that you would have to follow in order to make sure that you were able to properly exert your wealth.

But if you want a summary, we don't typically keep scrolls outside of our base of operation. So you're not going to find them here. Damn, I can certainly write you some footnotes though if you desperately want to, I would like to try. I share this is something that's very difficult, but if it's something I could learn how to do.

I, I think it'd be very hopeful, no. I I learned vanishing trick by the time I was eight. We can probably teach it. That's fine. I learned how to help my dad brush horses when I was eight. Mm-hmm. We all learn something different when we're kids, right? I learned how to I learned a lot of things Soco on.

It's sharing time. You just nearly had a textable, replace your entire rib cage. Come on. What did you do when he choco? I can't imagine you is a. You just always seem like a grumpy old, man. I think you always were he was born out of the womb like this just perpetually grumpy and built like a noodle salt and pepper mysterious.

Salt is right a ladder. Well, the built part is right. The reason I never really developed physically because I born with a bit of a condition. Never really never really physically. Good play with the other kids kind of had to be kept in doors. When you might not have been able to play with kids but you did just play with my old boss and stand your ground.

So, frankly, I'm gonna retract my sentences of noodle armness. Yeah, at least for today. Soco where you stood told with an Oni that was absolutely incredible. Yeah, that was

That was weird for me, in a lot of ways. I have a lot to tell you guys but after we rescue on the go no of course of course we're we're getting sidetracked. I'm sorry. It's very exciting that was that was very thrilling.

And you're sure Europe.

Are you sure you're okay? There are no way me. Yeah, I'm fine. You notice that she specifically not looking at the dead fever teachers. Like for better simply messed off. That's we now have a enemy ogre that knows and is capable of making use of the information that they gotten out of this club.

But always, How's Dundee as can be

And I think I'll leave you guys there good. I just wanted to get a couple more notes and I was super, super fun. I had a great time this session and Ochi doesn't feel so limp without now that he's got sneak attack. I'm like, wow, look at that. Damn it.

I'm not sneak attack is. It's so good, isn't it? And yet all of the ninjas have uncannito. Yeah. Yeah. They fortunate screaming, It's screaming. I still can't believe. I credited her man that was felt was an A plus play. Just snow directly to the face. Amazing? Was that kit?

Quit that she rolled against me? Was what the highest damage number. We've seen the entire game. Absolutely dude. Absolutely. I just highest this this thing for sure, We had like several things go specifically our way for the first half of this fight. Otherwise, this would have been really hard.

That would have been a way worse. Like if If only on a had managed to like hit and crit against Zia like that would have been that if the swords God's people could actually hit reliably like that's what base 13 15 inch damage or hit like this. I sucked.

This is all on the entire time. I was like terrified after a day after he read off the ownies spell list. Oh yeah, yeah. So I was never under. So like from a DM perspective I was never under any illusion. We were ever gonna stop Kim. And that's because came in to can fuck off.

Like literally just did anybody see that shit? Come here of like a like the ability she had that could just shut us down like if she had decided to use her first turn to cast darkness in that room Shoko would not have last a single term. Yeah. No. But did anybody see that shit coming?

Because I fully thought like, that. The rhyme Runners were just like happily paid sort of like civilian accounting mercenaries to be like yeah bro. I had a feeling the like they would have ninja, or at least like some people installed. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty cool acting just surprise Mafia boss.

No. Yeah. When she fully like shifted into Kimondatsu, I was like, I've made a huge mistake Genuinely. If that window hadn't been bored, like, and I and I'd rolled high enough to see that set to go fast enough. I tell you I was fully planning for knowing to just crash in through the fucking window just say get the fuck out of here.

Run Everybody leave. Now We go. We do whatever smoke bomb fucking leave. Just grow because holy shit, ownies are terrifying. Yeah. Terrible things. Yeah, that's pretty entire fight. I was trying to block her down with one of my single targets. Well, but I just I couldn't I couldn't get her like, like, I kept missing with my spelling sword and then I couldn't get the concentration off.

Yeah. It's it sucks. I mean even then I think I don't remember what kind of Onei but most only have SR anyway, so you could be pushing through SR as well. So yeah, it's pretty gross. They're they're just not not cool. Um, yeah, I didn't, I don't know them.

And all good on either didn't know that. I'm getting ahead. Only baby sword. Just oh, go ahead. Sorry, I was gonna ask if the only Bane sword would shut down her regeneration. No. No, I don't think so. No. And I just dropped, I was doing some research on it because I was like, damn, I this this program that I'm using to, like, come up with the notes.

It's even got this, like, cool, like thought web graph view or like ties. All the things together like a conspiracy board. There's a couple workarounds people have made or plugins for this application where you can actually share with people when I'm working on a way to be able to give you guys access to this to where I don't have to send like a manual update.

Every time I rewrite it for like a new session so I'll keep you guys updated but if you want to install it and play with it like I will be able to get you. What I have so far for free but I might have to like pay for a way to automatically have an updated.

After every time I add another session's worth of information, it's really fun. I've been having a good. I just get a folder right now I just downloaded it. Yeah, I will I think I can export it as a zip and send it over to you. I'll play with it here for a little bit after the session and drop it in the discord.

A man. I I love this kind of thing. Like, yeah, I saw you know, dude, I've spent so much time, like I was doing one note. At first, I did like a whole character backstory and a lot of notes on like, how to play. I've been like, what kind of person he is in there?

And then I realized I saw somebody else use this. I'm like YouTube. Those like this is perfect. This is so awesome. I'm really curious to see what the wiki entry for. Shoko says, I haven't really filled out anybody yet. I've mostly just not going back through my notes and creating all the pages as I go by writing like the each session kind of summary.

And then what I'm through that, I think I have one more session to get through. I'm gonna go in and start filling out. Everybody's like individual page with like more information. So when you click on like no way. I have no ways because I she like sent hers and I could just copy her and put it in there.

So that was really easy but like, oh cheese, backstory isn't even in here yet? I've just been working on like the campaign recap session by session and I hit up Didion about like figuring out what the actual start date was for the campaign so I can actually even put in like dates into this and make a timeline.

There's like a plugin I found that people use to like build a timeline. It's so in-depth and wild. And I could sit here and play with it, it like, scratches the part of my brain that loves that kind of stuff, but that's kind of. Now, that I know that you guys are down to even check it out, like I'll put even more effort into it.

I've just been, like, I've been working, like, 60 hours a week out in the Sun. So I haven't had a ton of time to like, get this super caught up, So the fact that you're even doing it at all, I think it's like fucking amazing. Well, I the other one, like one note was just so that I could do the recaps and like, but as we got into like the last two sessions, everything's gotten so dense and I've had a hard time paying attention.

Like I literally didn't even know what was going on. I was like I need to go back and like really figure out who all these people are because I was super lost and I will fold this closure use an apple. My phone to take like a audio, transcripts recording of this, so that I can go back and make good notes of it.

I hope everybody's chill with that. I'm not gonna share it or anything. I just wanted somewhere that I didn't have to type. As we went to try and keep track of everything. You know I'm saying? That's fair. That's fair. If anybody's uncomfortable with it, I can stop and just take manual notes.

And I'll tell Diddy into. I was just trying it to get like a good encapsulation of all the stuff that happens so we can keep better track because it's really hard when you miss like a couple of weeks to like remember what the fuck happened? Yeah, Yeah. For sure, Your character might be getting a nice, it's getting a nice item.

By the way, they're Abby. Which which one won't be talking about? Sorry? What? They got the item. We just acquired from your future. Oh, hey, wind. Yeah. Was was that what? What about what? What? So that's a wonderous magical item. You get free two free vanishing tricks a day if you wear it.

What that's all you needed to say them. Two three managing tricks, 500 phone fan soft tricks. Yeah it's the shows ago. Regular stats plus the youth. You've not a ninja. You get invisibility once a day and if you are you get two vanishing tricks, without spending key on top of your whatever you want to spend.

Okay? So what I'm hearing is this is my body slot for the rest of the campaign. Yeah. Yep. Pretty much. Yeah, there's some super stick stuff in here little. So I think Ochi if you need to know, is March 5th. Was our first session. Oh, I do kind of have dates on those from, like, discord and stuff.

I specifically meant Didion because he had said we're we all made the comment that we're like heading up to go over the pathogen high, right in the future. And he said in the winter and this is like my first campaign. So I was just wondering how all this stuff works.

The actual official Pathfinder in Galarian real-time. You're supposed of correspond to write the publication of the Jade Regent book one. So I was like, it's only been like six or seven in-game days and it was like August. So, you know what I mean? And then we inform you. Well, it took a couple of weeks in game to actually even get past like, Brian Wall.

I was just try and give us like a date on the travel. It took us to get to calls guard just kind of work it backwards with him. He says he has that information and he just hasn't gotten it back to me. I try not to bug him too much because like as you can see why everyone's been busy this fully days ADHD.

I will spend a lot of time on stuff that most people don't care about, just because I want to know. Yeah, I'm getting a guy spend time over the week, actually, writing down show goes backstory in. Getting it over to him. And I want to say sorry in my head.

But yeah, there's just If there's any of you guys who haven't read. I'm assuming everyone. I'm just gonna shame you guys. If you haven't read, Abby's backstory, for no way, Go read that shit. It literally looks like I haven't opened in another tab right now, and literally looks like it came right out of the players guide, for, for Jade region or any of the players, guys, like, literally down to the formatting.

I was so wildly impressed. I'm super jealous of the character art of, like, like, fits in the page, the same way, they formatted it. So I wanted to have that like for everyone like as much as we know if possible, but if not like, I don't know. That's not everybody's bag, but I want to, like, I'm just gonna I'm just sit here with my brain exploding.

A little bits with some ego right now. Just yes. Yes, do place. So that I probably won't just don't worry about in-game knowledge and my character doesn't know it. No, yeah, she explained bits of it but I was it's just impressive. You don't need to know it but like it was just really well done.

You know what I mean? I was like, this is super step. The majority of it. Like, you guys pretty much already know. Now, I was like yeah fun story ninja grew up being one here in girlsgod and then had to leave for a reason and was there the entire time until like I got really lazy and had an amazing time with a friend of mine who also happened to be a skin circle test and that, that ended very badly.

So yeah, there's a little time on the fresh principala and said, like get the fuck out. Go learn some humility and discipline and if you don't go and dig yourself a grave, So now I was like, geez, fuck you. Find them moms, really tell me you got it's like the the tragic rogue tragic backstory TM of a rogue but like, well done, which I didn't think existed.

I was like, this is this is a good shit right here. Chess kiss. Thank you. Yeah. So normally I'm gonna sign off there by the way. I'll see you guys next week. Oh, of course. Thank you guys. Thank you guys so much. I do have a quick question for everybody though.

Yeah. Before we all take off, I'm hoping my character being a little helpful with what he has, Bro. You carry this fight or you kidding? No brush. Yeah, that was the bed teacher body of my new suit. Yes. Not only last time that we encountered over Yani. Did you carry that entire flight by nature of your class.

But this time also like just putting a lot of work ochi in my opinion is like by far the weakest link and I've talked to Didion about like stuff that he can take in the future because I'm worried about him being underpowered. He's like, dude, basically, you know, I'm gonna like rule in your favor right now.

I have to worry about Grayson essentially, just murdering everything from afar. Yeah. And he was wrong races, zero zeo's out here. Rolling creates all day long, dude. The utility like it's just We would be we'd still be doing this fight right now. A few weren't in this fight. No, I don't actually find like, I mean, do I want to play an arcane, a flying, arcane caster?

The answer is yes, If you play a melee character, you're doing it for the flavor. If you play in an arcane caster, you're doing it because you want to win and like, yeah, exactly tip. That was. Yeah, we were yeah. Like the thing about this AP in particular as well.

I'd probably make a good argument with is that they say P. Is it ends a lot lower than most of the other APs? I think it ends at about 50. So like the really really bookshit. You're not going to be in touch with very like for a particularly protracted period of time.

Yeah, and I don't know if you guys all remember and most some people already even here when he brought it up. But he had mentioned, he really likes this game and he was like, we could run this right into the Ruby Phoenix tournament. I think he said, yeah, after this one and phoenix, so if we just moved together, we can go all the way to like, 20.

I believe, I don't know. I'm not a familiar with this as you guys seem to be, but that, just, maybe can potentially go to 20. I was talking with with sounds about this at the time actually because one thing that I I've done in the past is So obviously JB agent is the only AP that really takes place in, you know.

Yeah, so superior lands and we bland. So the problem is like having a lot of other module stuff, the kind of feeds into that, There's tons of stuff that happens like over in the world wound or Verisia or something like that. That you can kind of naturally weave in and use all modules for somebody that there's even stuff in like erosene.

That's got like, the the witch war? The super cool when our witch, yeah, there's the winner witch war or something like that that ties off of the backup or is a prequel to the. I think it's a pretty cool that like for various reasons you can play as though, like your characters that have gone through way of the reign of winter could potentially like end up going back and being involved in.

It's it's got some weird trip. So even Iristown has like self. But Tianja doesn't have many modules and things that take place in, you know, Ganja and I'm not talking about like a country, like Minkai, but why can't all the long time there? Yeah, I really read up on this stuff and I was like noticing every other APA, almost, I'm pretty sure.

Like you just said takes place somewhere in the intersee regions and then we have just Jade Regent that like the second half. Pretty much gets us there. Yeah. There's some minor. So there's some minor modules within Pathfinder society that take place in Tianja. Yeah, a couple were so things.

Yeah. Yeah. Like a couple of one off things. So I was just like if you need just like random shit honestly, just look into the ones that take place in Tianja. You can pull out the wiki to get a list. And even if like the level brackets are way too, low of whatever you want.

Like just change it up. Like, oh, this place is haunted by insert. I don't know. Like a dragon. Yeah. Like like a race and then just go. Okay, there's now a Draco glitch. Like it's you can just like you know and kind of do shit with that. It's it's not like it's not in feasible to do that.

The Ruby Phoenix tournament though is like the other real thing that has been kind of what I think. There's a mini BP in second edition. I currently, yeah, I sort of recommended just grabbing a hold of that and just ripping it and using whatever. The first edition equivalent would be, I'm gonna be cranking up the difficulty of it.

Um, hell yeah. Here's the funny part. When we finally hit sixth level, one of the spells I'm picking up is haste. So, preparing lights this. This many melee, if you hadn't said, hey, that was gonna be like, we need to talk. Maybe you. Furious DM typing, you know? I'm like, haste, I'm like do I want to pick fly or the blower pickup fireball?

Where there's other ones. Like lightning bolts. Yep. You certainly can. I will judge you Because of how many melee we hey hoping. When Choco gets to his third level spells you snags a good hope. That one's always really hope good. Hope is so nice to have never actually heard of that one.

I've listened to a lot of actual play stuff from, like, a couple different people, putting out, stuff like that. So, I've heard a lot of the classics, but I've never heard good hope. So good. Hope it, you know. Okay. Do you know the spell heroism? The vaguely? Okay, so Harry Wism is a 10 minute per level spell that you cast on someone that gives you a plus two, moral bonus to attacks, saving, froze, skill checks, you know, nice little long duration buff but it's a single target deal.

Good. Hope those, the same thing accept that it is one minute per level. It afflicts as many targets as you have castle levels and also affects weapon damage. Wow, The only people that get access to good hope. Bots. I I want to say she says I think like psychics might get it a particular subtype.

Psychics, I know for a fact, get it. But like, I don't know if all do and strangely enough clerics and paladins of Iona Day. Um, that is why I know about Good Hope because I'm like, every time I play and I own a day, and I'm like, fuck, yes, good.

Oh um, but because it's morale, those, If you are particularly sneaky and you give somebody a oh god, what's it called? It's a metamagic rod of Some say it's like beneficial or something like that, it increases the morale bonus of any spell. It's used with by one Jeez. So I mean I have a bod that I have a bad build that rather jokingly I I was supposed to play in Hell's Rebels game and her entire thing is that she can walk into an empty like street that's empty of of any heroes you know just a bunch of peasants and commoners and within three rounds turn them in like all of them.

So 14-ish people into like, what nine tenths Navy Seals was once. Yeah. Fighters. That's crazy. That like her entire thing is no, no, I don't get in. Callback, you do not hit me. You do not get me involved The one time. The she like that was her thing. She was just the support and the one time somebody managed to land something on her, it was people mind.

Oh, So she then proceeded to go while feeble-minded up to the witch that did it and beat the shit out of her with a cane. I literally was like, all right. So my characters completely think so. Luckily I have lingering performance, So all of my buffers both smells are still running and my performance is still running Including my bonus performers that was running at the time.

So I still have all of the shit. Currently I just don't have any of my things. He's like, yep. Like okay, am I allowed to charge? Like Yep, you recognize like, that's people-minded You recognize an enemy and you reckon, you know, enough to be able to, you know, do something about that.

You're just a complete savant right now, you don't have any like cognitive function. It's like, okay. So I go up, I charge and I'm gonna hit it with the wrong end of my squad game and then I crit killed her. Oh my god. Yep. Genuinely the funniest shit just after that very character.

Like they're like, okay, we're gonna go and get you a heel spell and they did. And my character spent two days literally sulking in in the base, just one fear even before. This was, I hate mental domination magic and you might be thinking for a bad. That's weird, but she genuinely is like, no, people are allowed to make free choices.

They're allowed to think, what they want. They're allowed to feel what they want. They're allowed to believe what they can see. I don't like illusions. I don't like enchantment magic. That is negative and I don't like people, you know, being lied to in that fashion. Yeah. So for someone who is supposed to be a haughty pretty bitch that got involved in the Revolution because frankly the dude banned mint and she didn't like that.

I naturally. I enjoyed that character. A great deal. I love Liana. She was. So they actually have a concept was a libertarian that actually cares about helps other people. Yep. She's she's a libertarian novel. Who's entire thing is, I am prissy bitch that has 15 billion vices but I want you to have the freedom to be able to choose those vices I can't criticize with so badly that I had the time to play in another campaign because I have like so many other ideas.

I've been bouncing around and I'm just like, no, We have other responsibilities. We can't just play Pathfinder five days a week. I know. I know the feeling I've been. I've been off with COVID recently. So I'm gonna bounce out. So I'll talk to you guys next week. Take it easy, man.

Thanks for running the loose sheet. Yeah, I'm just so happy. I don't have to do the lucci in this game, So so happy. Well, I'm gonna wrap up my obsidian notes and send them in the discord chat. And then I have to feed my girlfriend so I have to go to but this was super super fun.

Thank you guys. It's always a blasting, guys. You guys and I'm sorry. I was kind of late. Oh dude, no, that's not your fault. You've communicated that everybody you showed up for the fight and carried it. So once again, thank you for that. You know it's still fighting. Yeah, no we can keep it going and do this again next week.

And and really good moving on the campaign because like I'm super stoked for this story. I mean if it continues being early, I am gonna be late an hour. I don't I don't think it's gonna continue for too much longer. It's just the unfortunate situation of, you know, they're trying to sell their house.

So, yeah, I mean sucks, the way the market is right now. Hopefully, he gets it sold, but it is what it is, man. Like that's your schedule. You know. Did he comes the one who's got to change but it's working out right now. So I don't know, maybe we can find a compromise.

I mean. Yeah, cuz it's like, I'm I'm missing out on some of it, but I'm like, but I'm still here for the rest of it. No. Yeah. And like, once I now that I know that everybody's down to, at least try this thing a little bit. I'll try and keep the the recaps go in and get this wiki is in depth as possible.

So that even if you do miss stuff, you can be you know really up to speed so that when you're there you're not like playing catch up, you know, and no problem. All right. Thanks guys, have a good week. Take it easy? Yep, catch you next time, folks. You.
