00:08

The way it happened to the old mental fan. I believe. So yes. Oh, dear god.

00:25

I feel like we should give the scroll of cleanse sequoia so she could have that as a back up for abusing on them. Somebody eventually.

00:37

I also think we really tossed us slash.

00:46

What a wonderful idea? Says, no, i actually packs it. Like into as many small pieces as you possibly can.

01:02

Um, yeah. That headband of mental superiority.

01:14

Invitation fights over, whoever gets to wear her tiara.

01:23

Um, well, i think we just sell the thing if it's as expensive as i remember these things being

01:33

Uh, that's a fair point. Maybe we'll meet someone alone. Someone can wear it until we get to sell it. I mean i could make use of that, don't you? Do you have like that much? Use for wisdom crunch. My aunt intelligence i have a headband of gas intelligence plus two right now.

01:58

But again that additional bonus to my charisma will be grateful and then i can use my consume stalls in additional time a day up the damage for any of my exploits. All of the things that are not spells on alchemist on the arcanistar. Effectively charisma, huh? Because i have to pretend that they still care about the source of a part of it.

02:32

Well with no backstory to find out about what the heck. The reason for all this nonsense was, i'm sure the weird death will never come back to vites in the ass in any manner whatsoever and that was just the wrath of very angry and pissed off demon. Lord god.

02:51

Yeah, yeah. She's got like a journal around this room somewhere. When you say it like that, i don't like what that implies about the next couple days of this adventure. This. You're thinking small term. Yeah, okay. I have a bird brain. The we just killed for horse, frost things that were just as intelligent as me.

03:18

Uh, so we can scoop up all of our new stuff and make our way back down the spire. Everybody good to go.

03:33

Easy. No. I just literally take one step off the size.

03:44

Um, i'll take the stairs.

03:51

I think source i could wait. How do we get down? Yeah. Does the elevator? Not work? Now, i knew it.

04:04

So we have to like tie all of our rope together. What was the hand sign for that?

04:18

Um, so we live here now.

04:26

Anyone got used magic twice? Oh yeah, yeah. Oh, where, where do i where do i mean, it's fine? If i, if i get the headband, i have a really good. You have beat guy. Where's the terminal? There is in fact, a terminal, all right?

04:52

Uh, i also have a pretty good ulnb check. Uh, so uh, do you want to aid me on this one zero? Which bonus? There's a plus 22. Oh, 22. Okay. Yeah. Here's just a little bit better than that. I got plus 16 right now. Kind of, that's, of course, without it.

05:17

We all go ahead. I can't i i i can't give me just a moment.

06:21

Spell glue. Oh well, all right. Okay, we both die.

06:32

Why would she trap the one that goes down as you remember what else? Yeah. Demon. Oh, freaky. Go for the two of you touching panel, give me, we'll saves DC 21.

07:09

Okay, you're a bard.

07:14

What you're a bard? Yeah.

07:21

Um, okay with traffic loose. So, which one would she have done? She is a bitch.

07:41

Hope they remember to check for trash before the terms of that. But we're gonna go with each turn. The target has 50% chance to act normally otherwise it takes no action.

07:57

Oh, so just confusion. No.

08:06

Chance that you act normally otherwise you take no action.

08:19

Uh, okay i guess i'll call high then I will roll. I'm looking up. Remove curse. Coyote can do it tomorrow.

08:48

So, i fail. So what happens just i freeze in place. Uh, yes. You literally just stand in place on those realms. Uh,

09:03

But you get the elevator working and luckily for you is just takes you down to the first floor.

09:15

All right. Somebody's gonna need to like, i guess online. A mako carries you like a like a princess.

09:32

It's been around if he stumbling get on as he really casts floating disc, there you put around and get choko. Back to the caravan. Okay. I thought it was going to be like the panel attracts me into walking off the edge somehow. And like, as now is thinking, i hope they checked the trash, she would just look to her son.

10:02

See me? Going wood bottom. Yeah, she just has but still curse in there. He's got immigration and some other people develop these eyes and be fun. It's all over papa panel from the last one. There we go. There's plugs.

10:34

Right. So i'm on this thing because i thought it sounded fun and i wanted to take a ride. We do not tell. No way. Why i'm actually on this thing? Wait, i missed it. Why is he why are you on this desk? Because it's a fun ride. Let's see, stares at you blank faced.

10:59

Delightful. Uh,

11:05

Oh, are you cursed or something?

11:12

Uh, principal reach out and we'll cast a spell on you. Oh no. I have to figure out how to cast it. Other things. Wait, you can do that. Grayson can do literally everything. Uh, what is person trying to do? It's in chat. He did a key point to cast placebo effect.

11:42

It's a presence that certain affliction for inspiration. Nice. So you give you give him some some time of not being paralyzed, it's 50% of the time.

11:59

About eight minutes.

12:04

Oh wow, this is great.

12:11

Wow, grease. Since this one. Can you cast magic like that? Magic, wait. And just i did a special, uh, monk pokey thing in your neck. Yeah. Job you in the neck? Wow, i feel great. Think you killed my back problems.

12:35

Oh, all right. Then oh yeah, all of our bus come off.

12:44

Some good hope and all that. Yeah. Oh yeah.

12:55

You know, he's probably fire.

13:02

So by, how much did i miss the dc to find the trap by not looking for trap at all? I don't i mean that no i looked for a trap. She just rolled and got high enough that she got it and you did.

13:25

Okay, number rolling. Presumption. First off, you rolled perception last game session for the second level did one for traps. And i definitely didn't roll it here because a combat and b after that belly,

13:43

Yeah, no way. Fucked up. I i don't i yeah, i didn't perceptional. I just remember you being asked to make two disable device checks.

14:00

Going down. Yeah, go ahead. You guys make it back to the caravan?

14:10

We this leads to something really fun. They really fun. I mean a i don't think you mean fun. You keep on using that word. I don't think you it means what you think it means. Uh it beats you a yeah. A 500 mile brush through the snow. I as the armies of the undead.

14:49

Chase your caravan. Oh, are more than you can actually fight. Let me guess. Um this is like a continuous 500 mile. Chase essentially is continuous 500 mile chase, i the yep. Yep.

15:10

Um, you can't see me thinking into my chair until like, my chin becomes one with my torso.

15:21

All right, mark is chief scene ever. No. It ends in culmination sort of right here. Not there. Come on.

15:48

But they will just happen.

16:04

Your animals can't keep up anymore. They're on the verge of dying and if you lose the wagons you're going to lose a lot. Uh, and as you near the pathogen high off approaches you guys, we are near a place called dead man's dome. We must make a stand.

16:34

But take it, we have not rusted at all. No transport, man, the rocks near me. It depends on how well you think, your character could sleep for eight continuous restful hours in the back of a caravan traveling through feet of snow, continuously out of brushed pace. Running away from undead.

16:57

You get. Did you get to hit the rest button once? Yeah, i was going to say it like, we're, but you have not had time and you can prepare yourself. Everyone goes hit their rest buttons but it'll be fine. I'd rather you be prepared. Yeah, i was gonna say like if it's to the path of argenheim then this is weeks of travel even at all.

17:29

And as you draw within 50 miles of the dead man's dome, it becomes apparent that the army of the undead has encircled your wagon, and his outpacing you. As they do not tired. So i do a quick question. Are people okay with zero using the headband? Okay? I just wanted, i just wanted to

17:59

Just put your old headband back on the loop list. I wonder well do. Bring up the item communion.

18:28

It's only four thousand more gold pieces than the ways shows a coup. So that's your one. Uh, mako has the sword. You have the headband. The mako has the coolest tracksuit. Uh grayson Shilco and iron next. We get the next three. Really cool things. Give me no way has the tracksuit.

18:51

I said, nobody has a track suit. Did i not omega has the sword? Noe has the tracksuit. He has the headband zero has the headband, which i will happily sell with people just want the gold. I was just pointing out that we're not above giving these things to people and making a joke about it.

19:09

No one wants you to give back your attraction. Manhattan, if you're invisibilities today, that sounds grabs, like who i, i don't use vanishing trick. Who else would use that, right? That's better for you than anybody else. Like to headband's better for zeo. I didn't realize he had like so much charisma based stuff.

19:29

I was just saying, we've done it before when the wealth by level skew was like even more hardcore. It's not a big deal.

19:49

Actually, everybody has to play. If we don't die, everybody has to gamble with sandru and OT. So he can win some of their money. That's his lawful good character, quote unquote.

20:14

I think during the long struggling of flight, oh jesus, like i i didn't think this is how i would go. I didn't think it would be skeletons, skeletons, whites zombies? Dead people. I didn't think it would be dead people.

20:40

Be killed off in flavor attacks.

20:47

We got the cutscene the bad end cutscene.

20:56

Um, where did my work go?

21:03

Can we also have healed up using once and stuff viacoya because i think we're all down after the lightning. Yeah, that's fine. This is this is gonna be a fight.

21:23

Hooray. Bring on a tough fight. Let's do this. Can this be like all the co-tour 2 will be like um, dantoine where we go, do a bunch of, like, sabotage and traps and shenanigans and then fight waves of there. There is not enough time for that. I was thinking more of the final mission of Halo reach.

21:49

Oh, is this the mission? Uh, oh gosh, it was like almost a year ago. You're talking about this like some point in time where maybe we would control the caravan in pcs in a fight. Yo this, this is that fight actually oh, is way cooler than us dying. This is us dying, but i get to play characters that were built good.

22:14

I did not modify all of the NPCs so please don't think that. Okay, boom.

22:27

Because i have a lot of enemies. I need to work with.

22:39

And now i will bring you here as you're approaching dead man's dome. I'll tell you the story of the lone warrior that died on this mounds, and that it is said, but in times of great need that warrior rises again to help people.

23:04

So this is the fourth boss of this book because it was, um, i can't remember his name. The evil cleric oracle. The evil oracle that it was a dragon, then it was flying lady. Now, it's all of everybody that's died up here in a long time.

23:31

All right, so who wants cool? Everyone gets picking. Npc, we got shillelu, we got kelda. We got sand drew. We got queer. We got a mako, we have uh, the wolf. We have like a bunch of often. Warriors. Who am i forgetting? We're beginning to have both spinny orphan oak chaka.

24:02

That's right.

24:12

The book that scagged me, can i be next to everybody?

24:20

Uh well i've never i've never controlled a ranger before. So i'll take Shalayu, let me make sure that's the leveled version of sulelu. It is, i gotta have it. I gotta i gotta have the winter wolf. If he doesn't immediately turn on us right out. Little configure. Ownership are observer.

24:51

Magnus owner.

24:59

Misheard that i thought you said Magnus boner. And i was wondering that was, like, show goes a bit on last names. Guide me.

25:15

All right, let's do happy gracing. Who you want? Uh, is there a leveled version of kalba? I think i actually leveled killed. The she is level six.

25:36

Because i feel like thematically wise, that makes sense is the battle in this map. The circle higher up on this page? Yes, this you are. You are on a fucking a null. Basically because we still have all our tokens down on this. Think at the bottom it looks like we were oh yeah we do.

26:01

Yeah.

26:08

Open sleep. That we are over here. Oh,

26:20

I think this might okay, that's okay, i encourage is more worth it than

26:32

And rondo. Does the rondo have a numerical limit to how many people can have it? Yeah, i did. It does. It's um it doesn't matter the answers? Yes. Use inspire cards. If you want your miracle differences because the post multiplier on that,

26:55

Castle.

27:01

If it's one allied high level. So, it's eight people.

27:09

Uh, and as you guys form up around this hill in the undead approach, this man just sort of breaks up from his grave.

27:24

A hot. Damn, he's really cool looking. He kind of looks at all of you. His eyes finally settling on the mako.

27:39

And goes to one knee before her.

27:51

All writing.

27:56

Oh yeah, um is not here {question-mark}. I am not on this map. I don't think you're not. Am i am i understanding or something? No, just drop you here then and i gave you permissions for kilda.

28:21

Um, but OT being next to him here. A solilo man, man. Sandra. Just got no love this time. I'll change my answer, I'll place Andrew instead of scaged me, i thought he maybe go a little bit more on his character sheets.

28:46

Since then scagged me. No, he's just a name. Blinker wolf. Yeah, that's what i meant. I thought maybe he was a little cooler than that. He's still cool happy. He's here. Um, but ochie's gonna seeing this dude, just like zombie vampire levitate up to his feet out of the snow and like, take one knee before makeo he's going to turn to open.

29:12

Say, you'll fight with us, good. I don't want to join you today.

29:22

We will do. We have time to clear down box. Uh i will give you a round to throw them buffs and then we will take a quick break and get started. All right. Uh, everyone has their npc selected and they can see them. No way. Did you add me?

29:41

Have you picked someone?

29:49

Everyone zombie.

29:55

I think we made it possibly. She probably did this time to sneaky a few. Yeah i haven't, i haven't chosen one because i don't know. I'll be interested that we get back to sandra, you can do sandru. Um,

30:14

The scagony disappeared from my then pc's part and is not in the character's part.

30:25

Abby, if you're talking, we can't hear you. I think she's sneaky afkade.

30:43

Very objective survive. That's that's what i was talking about the final mission of reach where you hand off a cortana to the ship as it takes off. And it's like, okay now what i have never played range. Sadly.

31:03

Game.

31:08

Amigo encoyo, i can manage to find. So Andrew spiffy ukushaka. All very beautiful pick up like a new study if you want us to control them all. So you have less to control all take on another one. I'm more than happy. I know you have like yeah 50 things to do on this fight.

31:33

Yeah i have a lot to do. Yeah i'll take. Oh i was gonna say i'll take the pair of wolf and oak chaka but if not i'll take Sandra man. I'll definitely take x Andrew. Oh no. Anyone's that are not being controlled are not going to be on the battlefield, okay?

31:47

They're going to be in the background. So we only get one is what you're saying, right? We need to control everyone. Okay, i'll take a, i'll take sondru and uh um who also's lots of oak chaka spiffy?

32:08

Okay, i'll take sondru and Stevie is cleaned by rye, right? You should have access to sleep now. Yep. Okay. So all takes Andrew and Chaletu and you could take off and Oshaka, right? Then i think, um, grayson has shillelu but yeah, i'll take off an oak chaka. Chronological Grayson has killed a oh, that's right.

32:31

Yeah. So, you can totally take a, but they have begun a romance. That's true to make a cool new pc but i'll take our guides build the person if you comes back, maybe he would like poison or amigo and that she would have very fun with the maker quiz mine.

32:55

Oh, i think we all know that by now, but i think uh, ivy would have a lot of fun with a mayco.

33:03

Abby is also super familiar with how to run paladins. So abby is getting mako i will. Yeah, so no one i'm doing with hero. Uh, sandra and Shillelu. I'm already looking at sondru is just, uh, What is Sandra?

33:28

Alfandrew is a seventh little rope swashbuckler.

33:41

All right. Oh, you can tag is broken here because these are all skeletons and he has a right there. Oh, should i do also kissing?

33:59

He also needs to have sneak attack though.

34:06

Um, because do these two need to be using these, these weapons are can make it well, okay. Okay. Shalom needs her though. But and yeah, i guess, i guess i'm drew his magical weapon is the rapier okay?

34:33

All right, these two are going to be posted up here in the the borough, just doing their best, i guess.

34:46

Just realized, i don't know how well it is going to be doing with this in this combat.

34:56

I mean, spooky's got six head ties.

35:02

Good point and four star night attacks. She's got four started off attacks.

35:15

Was wrong. She's got 10 hd, but it's just that like her main weapon is not going to be doing much of it. Course. All right. So, we're gonna take our little break here, and hopefully Abby will be back by then, hopefully you run into some more of those at some point.

35:41

Oh yeah. These are still at themselves.

35:48

So i don't even know my first, what? My first, but my bosom movie casting is

35:58

All right, i will also video

36:50

What are you doing? Steve here.

37:00

I'm good. I said, what are you doing? I'm good.

37:32

If anyone's wondering that is the cheat code to get a tank in San Andreas,

37:44

Why does the name start? Not have a damage under it because at least that is image. No, no, not sure is you fire two hours with the same shot. Yes. And that shot hit and murdered that horse spirit as he had already sustained damage. Oh then, i guess. Uh, down one for the rest of the shots.

38:11

Down one through here. Yeah, all right. Attack two will miss, but your rapid shot will hit.

38:25

Uh, and that will visually, let's turn.

38:36

You know, as a player, i'll be really curious if there's going to be more waves of things or if this is a

38:47

Is a dean. This is giving me competitions.

38:54

We got two goal against Michigan. I commends that you are prepared to do with this many things on. What about you do? But i would never this is sick. I am greatly enjoying this, i do really like this. Yeah, i'm glad.

39:20

I guess this is one of the payoffs of us trying hard to get. Here we go. People into our care events instead of just like letting them die or letting him walk away. This is very much suicide mission moment. Well, you actually need the bodies that finish the missions successfully so you need to do the loyalty mission thing in Mass Effect.

39:41

Exactly good. Oh, she is.

39:48

Uh, channeling to damage with this first one, and excluding the unnamed samurai

40:33

Very,

40:42

So, my

40:53

I really should have set up that drops him to zero which means he dies other no they all die. Quick control z.

41:14

Yeah, man. Oh dear.

41:22

Oh really wish there was an undue button. I mean, most of them were at full health and like you could just throw them all back out there and throwing back an initiative. Most of them don't roll higher than us. Anyways.

41:43

Support it. Uh, one horse spirit here. One here. You're the one that died though.

42:04

Seven.

42:09

To work across spirits here. Seven.

42:33

Well, all right.

42:40

The unnamed samurai steps forward with his blades.

43:20

And ends that frost white and it's a squirrel of deal and snow.

43:33

With the tackling lab on the winds and storms and a femoral winged woman dances in the snows, no way. Who could that be? This again. Oh, i hope someone knows how to make me play because i'm all out of portions.

44:10

Grayson uh creations gonna ignore the little spirit next to him at a back and i miss

44:29

Boom. And you're using your blunted arrows, right? Yes.

44:39

Just do this.

44:46

It takes four of your arrows, the finish off with mammoth.

44:59

If there is an extra air still, then it'll go against someone. That's right. Next to me, your quiero is still available.

45:13

Only has four hp left, just need to go away now. All right, that's it's hurt. Now, i'm going to go take a nap until uh, so let's go. Let's turn there.

45:33

Oh gee. Yeah. Okay. Oh, not that either. Now that's what we're going to do.

46:13

It's going to throw a bunch of shuriken using two weapon fighting.

46:23

And this one.

46:31

Slightly reduced damage though.

46:37

The Horcross. Oh nope. Never mind bitter full image. Lowercross spirits are not the ones with the air bubbling. That's the mastodons.

46:51

Those sure cans almost murder him. Good good points of sugar can damage and then oops, i can only see that with the same inferable enough as about one comic strip from midnight. I'm not familiar because i threw shuriken. I don't get it. Yeah, yeah. Oh shit. Actually no. Hold on.

47:28

Kilometers. Educate you. Please do. I'm watching chat.

47:40

There's so much going on with map. Okay, so he died on the third attack. No, i'm assuming your final attack goes on the next one. Farther south. No because then i'm going to take a range penalty. I think, um, that's beautiful. I'm gonna go for the one to the north because he's closer.

48:00

I think is it? If i think it's a 10 foot range on the sherry can. So i'll be minus 4 on the last attack if i was going for that other one. So this guy so that guy right there. I mean you beat that minus 2. Yeah, you can throw it in.

48:19

This is just, this is the only time when this buffed is this viable at all. I'm all right. All right. I need to go furniture um an OG certain specifically. Yeah, and then he's going to he's gonna challenge big boy.

48:51

And say, you're next.

48:56

Like points that itself with its rotten. It's truck me. That's funny. Random bullshit go. That's incredible.

49:11

Anything else for you? That's gonna be it. That's all, that's all i'm gonna get done today. You actually didn't even pull the full version of that panel. My question is though is getting rid of paralysis affect. Now a good idea or late. Use it. Save it for later.

49:33

I mean, sundru's got four rounds of paralysis going Grayson's, right there. If Grayson wants to stop murdering people for a standard action, he can do his, uh, his neck poke on sand. Drew, it's true. Oh, i'm also gonna say i'm so sorry for reaction on my turn to talk focus.

49:51

Your archers focus on the mammoths. We can handle the little ones.

50:00

Well, do you want me to focus on a mammoth or help sandra stand on one leg shoot mammoths? Six browns at a time with your bow and use your foot and poke him in the neck. Okay, because maybe we can remove a palace once.

50:27

You tell us what's big you would do, i want you to really get into the character of spiffy. I think spivy finds the concept of paralysis and Aphmau, and would immediately unparalyze someone. As a worshiper of desma, there is the fact that that is currently, there isn't many more enemies on this left side.

50:48

So it might be needed to be saved for someone on the right side or the the bottom. Okay? So, i guess she could she's going to go ahead and channel.

51:02

Arm undead and oh, shit, she does not have. It's like a cat. Like 45. Random bullshit, go.

51:12

I have block.

51:23

Literally for her. I think you might be out of range. Now he's he was if literally in range, even five foot staff, you're right. Five foot five, five foot flutter. Can you as the gm read anything put in the chat in any language. Okay. Cool show me people like 10.

51:49

I five ten feet that way and then do it.

51:58

I think i propose in 15 feet here.

52:09

I'd like not that great of a channel, but hey panel to her or channel to heal you that's town. Can everybody else read that translated part or is it not show? Yeah, i can read it. Oh god damn it. I did see it. Okay, how do i say something without saying something?

52:30

Over voice and that didn't work. I have seen incorporated.

52:41

Why did it did that? Translate it from abyssal. Show up for everybody. Oh no. You have the language. I shot in the dark that i was like. I hope nobody else has a missile zeo. Might have a Bissell. Yeah. Look at it before. All right, so seven, i'm surprised i have a missile to two and u to the four frost spirits and the whites are fine and meditative half if i if i you know.

53:26

Minus seven.

53:33

It is it okay for me to remove the three? Three. That reminds me. I have two more languages. I need to take because i spent another linguistics and i didn't pick anything yet video. When you feel right now, i'm going to go ahead and remove the radius. Oh, no already did two.

53:58

Oh,

54:03

Who has?

54:13

Yeah, i do. I was looking at a sheet one more time because i wanted i thought about running up and helping the unnamed samurai but then i don't want to watch all get deleted by the mammoth. So they just thought of a bumps on all. Uh yeah. Skagged me and oh, have all the buffs.

54:32

They don't get the icons. You can't turn icons off that individual buffs thing, but it was something that drives them had toggled and surely i wouldn't see them on, don't she?

54:50

Oh no. It's on each each buff, you can go and change it. So i think by default they're set to show he's not gonna break formation and he's going to throw his throwing acts at that way right there or girl or they

55:11

He did not have it on on. What is inspired courage? Uh, i didn't check the box. Yeah, oh no. Did you just turn it on? Because i was looking and it's on now. I did. Well skag me headed on.

55:37

He said, checking to make sure it was on.

55:45

He's gonna double move up the hill.

56:00

Ah, lg begins crying. All right.

56:12

We get a trample. Oh no gore. No. He tried so cheap. Because don't she challenged him and he missed.

56:25

Don't don't be too excited about that.

57:09

Which is up to meet the unnamed samurai's. Epic sword battle. The unnamed samurai perry, some effortlessly as if the white didn't exist. I need to download here. OT said that out loud. That's so sick.

57:35

19 to hit sketch me, that does hit scag me.

57:48

I'm scagged me, laughs.

57:54

It doesn't scike. Nigga of oh, even with production against evil. Boom, when you do to hit uchaka for 13, i did put protection from evil on scag me. Does professional people not work on evil creatures? It doesn't doesn't.

58:22

Patients be able to get the benefits from it. So, protection from evil toddler affects people regardless of their alignment.

58:33

The the buff smell might not have actually mechanically added, its numbers to your to your like eight seeds. Such i had to go in and add that for Grayson and killed a manually.

58:48

Well, that's a that's a lot of damage.

58:55

Uh, but the cold doesn't go through and he has dr. 10. So, it's really not that much damage. Okay.

59:08

Food. No way. Why you gotta be here, bro?

59:23

So you're gonna stealth and run up to the mammoth again. Yeah. Because getting bodied, the last time was a really fun experience. I'm sure these ones are different, right? Chemical. No, no. You should try it.

59:45

I missed it the last time, so this

59:54

I am. That's what they're trying to like.

01:00:08

So sure you can get bullets. Do you have like five characters? Make some flanking happen. I literally can't not the amount of movement that i have. That's what i'm saying. Sacrifice a mako. Make a run out where it's dangerous, so you can get flanking. That's what i'm going to do.

01:00:32

God. Nobody controls are naked. Now no way could decide that she wants to be empress. All right? All right, i am. I'm going to, you know, what to do, what you want. I'm gonna try not to lose my fucking mind. So figure it out.

01:01:03

She's in pain. She's in pain.

01:01:18

Okay, well, i'm gonna do this then.

01:01:29

And she loves about that.

01:01:58

Oh, that boy. Okay, you don't have those.

01:02:08

Shoko.

01:02:18

Let's go has no way of picking up Sandra so

01:02:49

45.

01:02:57

And i don't want to risk on everyone. So, this one

01:03:25

Of course.

01:03:33

But mainly if it is broken, none of your breath. All right. Three.

01:04:24

Let me go is going to activate spite evil on the mastodon.

01:04:59

The vehicle have good, hope on.

01:05:04

Probably not. Yeah, you don't have good hope on it.

01:05:20

You got inspire courage, though, and protection from evil.

01:05:30

Omeco does get good hope though, so she's got it on now. It's still not enough to get that to confirm. Unfortunately, i can take them over to if you want. Now it's like i'm familiar enough of them. Look shaka in fact, that's not looking so good.

01:05:53

But he's going to try and, you know, whether the attacks.

01:06:01

Spent her ranger with us. Rangers focus.

01:06:12

What do you mean her abilities from being a I guess a guy it just says uh, it's more flexible than favored enemy. It's like, um, it's like studied target. Oh, okay. I'm trying to figure out what exactly a day. So assuming it's part of her guide archetype. Yeah. So if you click on it, it'll probably tell you what it does but i bet it's like a plus one per every four, six levels or something to a target as like a swifter a move action and then you can just add it as an attack bonus like this plus four.

01:07:05

Yeah, it doesn't really tell me what it does or what action is.

01:07:14

Would it be a move action? Once per day swift action, line of sight until it dies plus two bonus on attacking damage rules against the target of his focus. At fifth levels, it goes up by two, so plus 4 attack, plus four damage. Uh against a target is a swift action.

01:07:41

Until it dies. Okay, no problem. I well, i'm not gonna, i'm not gonna, i'm not gonna wasted it right now. Only do it twice a day right now. Throw it on a mammoth and unload on mammoth.

01:07:57

Yeah, and then she dies. This is shillelu right. Oh, look shaka. I'm sorry. Yeah, never mind. I thought this was a forage attack so i was like,

01:08:17

Whoops.

01:08:28

Doubt that is probably living here.

01:08:34

Uh, no, unfortunately that misses by one. Okay, so that's the inner hard time.

01:09:13

Here, you've got to double move.

01:10:01

Man, we went

01:10:16

This moments. Nope, he already went here anyway. Good. Oh, round two.

01:10:35

For our spirit, pick the double clawed skydney and hits him with one boom though. The second one. Misses, Dying. Okay, brings us to zero's turn.

01:11:02

Yep, here we go, guys.

01:11:10

He's got some juicy targets here.

01:11:15

That's not good.

01:11:22

I have some duty targets but i'm also trying to say, Uchaka at this point. He's not looking too good.

01:11:37

I mean, we've got resurrection magic at this point. Don't we now look shall go. We don't.

01:11:47

Plan not prepare anything. Oh dear, koya spends 100% of her time, and effort channeling, and cure moderate, wounding ochi that is for full-time job. I mean time what i'm i'm trying to get both the ones that in front of us but problem is if i get if i go get hit in both of those you head out.

01:12:08

She, let's remember that these characters are in the mindset of well, we might as well fight if they're going to kill us. Uh, and that's why we stopped here. I don't think they're worried too much about resources, so if you, if it can help get you out of the bind, i would just pop the rangers focus on one of the icy boys in front of you and try and do some damage on one of them.

01:12:27

And somebody else can run around. Not one of them down, gave him out of threatened. I have the question, i have though. How big would i what if i can't fireball? And i hate it were. I'm gonna say right where i've got it right now. What hit? Not that actual market city.

01:12:47

Now, i would have no. I didn't even angle it right? Summer bitch.

01:13:01

I was trying to go right there if you go one. Yeah, you go one up. It'll hit all the enemies without anything other one. There we go.

01:13:24

I'm i stuff. I was supposed to add the conditional cash level to the to the spell on OD6.

01:13:36

So we're all natural d6.

01:13:44

Of 26.

01:13:52

What was frostbite survived?

01:14:35

Already anything else on either? Oh, it's the manist all life. Uh yeah, the man still alive.

01:14:46

Yeah, that's the end of my turn.

01:14:52

Sorry boss. They got 983.

01:14:58

Yeah, is dead. Killed it. It's okay. The man with a focused on actually.

01:15:10

Yeah, that's what i'm talking.

01:15:16

That made method is focused on option. I'm just going to move underneath spiffy since boobies, 15 feet up.

01:15:28

Which means she can charge that breath that, that way church and we'll do parts.

01:15:45

As she is like gleefully yelling about like finally something i could kill i've been sitting around doing nothing.

01:15:58

She has now been sitting around doing nothing. You've been teaching her knitting as you craft wondrous belts and such 19 minutes of truth because i wipe down.

01:16:16

On my screen there names have combined so now it is count spiffy iter. It done for me also.

01:16:36

Oh god. It's flagging so badly today. I is there. I gotta know. I can't hold it in grace and you have a plus three feet of elevation on. On Grayson. Do you have some like fancy munkability? That makes you just levitate all the time. Uh, no. I think that's what i'm standard.

01:16:53

Oh, there's a plus three feet of elevation. I notice because Spivvy has the 15th of that. It's paradise. He's paralyzed three feet in the air. No, three more rounds. Oh, okay, that makes sense. Uh, escagney is going to crunch a horse frost spirit.

01:17:21

I mean it sounds like a good time.

01:17:32

Because i don't think his breath weapon is going to do anything to these and he knows that.

01:17:51

And then i think he's going to take a five foot step back because he started to get a good amount of heat.

01:18:05

Growling the whole way.

01:18:19

That will be his turn.

01:18:37

Think of attack. That's super miss.

01:18:48

Heck yeah.

01:18:55

Broth away.

01:19:05

Big swing on a mako.

01:19:11

You know, attention to the cones. If you can see those measure outboard. What i want to do.

01:19:21

And chillilu.

01:19:44

Magnet. Oh. Oh, shall I loser? Right, right. Um uh shillelu will uh okay. There's one attacking ochi. There's also the one attacking. Oh okay. That's that's gonna be a bigger focus. I think.

01:20:05

So select open up shallow but positive positive. Oh, toggle hill mode and bam.

01:20:24

She could have rolled better do all of those myths.

01:20:33

Uh, she was taking the mammoth. Yeah, it looks like yes, it's they all miss.

01:20:51

Western.

01:20:57

Hit the enter. Okay. So first oh there's no button right now.

01:21:06

Boy, it's gonna channel to heal.

01:21:43

And then she's gonna channel to damage.

01:21:52

She's gonna exclude that dude. Before you apply any of that, don't do it to the entire token group.

01:22:48

There was some bullshit up in there.

01:23:38

Way.

01:23:48

I know, i know.

01:24:05

Minus 8.

01:24:23

All right.

01:24:32

So the samurai looks at amigo, who is now surrounded, because that's what amigo does.

01:24:50

Positive. I and the katana in his main hand, erupts in golden flames, that starts burning away at his body as well.

01:25:14

By foot stamps up.

01:25:21

Yo.

01:25:35

Wiping it and roll with damage, right? Because i modified the wrong thing, of course they did.

01:25:54

One more thing, one more thing.

01:26:12

Jackie Chan confuses me because he's like a misogynistic thing, traditionalist like asshole. But also, i like deeply respect his decision and not giving any money to his kids. He's like, no go or not yourself. I don't do nepotism, right?

01:26:32

Like you're on thin ice bro, thin ice.

01:26:50

And they drive by tackling.

01:27:00

Of course, she disappears. Once more into the storm prison, she not actually doing anything just like moving around. She's using, uh, cackle as a move action to maintain the parallel eyes on sand drew {question-mark}. No, she's just, disembodied. Spirit in the storm.

01:27:27

She's gonna laugh at us the entire way to the wall of heaven.

01:27:34

And possibly draw and into you.

01:27:42

Brad.

01:27:48

Fired up the mammoth, armored my word. The only one of those that needs the last. It happens, it happens.

01:28:07

Booty. Okay, the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to roll a skill, check as like a knowledge check

01:28:22

I want to see if i can use my lower sword master to know about this, dude.

01:28:34

And if i know anything, could you send it to me? Because i'm not saying anything because we're in the middle of a fight, that's not important right now. I just want to know.

01:28:45

Uh, i'm gonna say no with that one. Yeah, that's a strong. No. That's okay. Then ochi is finally going to step up to this mammoth that he challenged 10 years ago. I mean, he came up to meet your challenge. He did, he did and then he is going to

01:29:10

Do some things.

01:29:16

Look at my cool animations dude. Oh yeah. Basically the two hubby are using your animation that you are rolling. So much to me though, am i? Okay, i mean that's just the abilities. I didn't roll any attacks yet.

01:29:36

Public.

01:29:42

Apparently i can only make those private but as long as my, my key points came out, we're good.

01:30:06

I didn't put the kamikaze on the one hand. Heck, i forgot to check that box.

01:30:17

It's okay. I will take your kamikaze damage from the first two and apply it. Eight, and four is the next trip. Well. Boom. Luckily for you, your first tech, kills. The mirror. And i'm just going to do the same thing in apply it myself damage twice.

01:30:41

Oh then, moving down to here.

01:30:50

Because i assume you make him your final attack. Um, yes, boom, you drop him to zero which means he dies, because he's undead.

01:31:07

Okay. So that was full attack action. That's it, that's all i got.

01:31:15

Bringing it to smoothies turn. So silly is a clerk that. Can he spent some spells to cast to yourselves, right?

01:31:34

Oh, shaka.

01:31:55

Check. Oh, what? He probably cut out, but i assume he's casting. Cure fell on.

01:32:09

Come on.

01:32:14

Not on the stupid cons. I'm the i'm gonna do. It's okay. Hitting him of the cures fell. What is it killed him more? That is the end of stephy's. Turn bringing us to Ulstern.

01:32:39

I'm gonna move 50 downed out, they're all seca.

01:32:47

It won't let me move it.

01:32:57

I'm going to move spiffy down towards osaka.

01:33:08

Which during that's the wrong character.

01:33:16

Oh, i was checking something for next turn. I didn't hear you say old fian, i'm sorry.

01:33:26

Off is going to.

01:33:36

Attack this one.

01:33:53

Do i still have it? No, i did it public. That's a mess. I'm sure you don't have or that. Is the plinking in there? No.

01:34:16

Unfortunately, that actually still makes you too doors 1819.

01:34:26

Rough day for, um, he doesn't have a lot of features. So uncertain shield mesh. I know i don't have a shield bash button, do i? He doesn't. That's why i didn't see it. It does token action had

01:34:50

How's that? And that's, that's a bunch is what that is? Yeah, i don't make much use of the, the token action so that's why i didn't see that, but that's going to be. Oh, maybe i could move. Can i move anywhere? Useful are especially how five footstep there. And that will be Ulster.

01:35:20

All right.

01:35:25

Next frostbite.

01:35:32

So, i'm two single attack.

01:35:49

Also shield bash.

01:35:55

That moment is dead. When you shield bash, is that two up and fighting because i didn't put a penalty in for that, right? It is to open fighting, don't worry about it this time. His attacks weren't built out that way it is. I should have typed it in, i'm sorry.

01:36:16

Need to start looking very good.

01:36:40

So that crosswhite swings at the end named Samurai, misses with his sword swing. And then when he tries to hit him with his shield, the unnamed samurai just kind of looks down at him.

01:37:00

And so if completely unaffected by his shield pack big me that's miss

01:37:17

Crossbow in minutes. One is the unnamed samurai to is going to be no way. Three is the miko. And fourth is both, of course, it may go because it's my day, boom. Boom. Amiko is unconscious but not dead. Oh my god.

01:37:51

Rip.

01:37:58

Go away.

01:38:07

Fighting well attack.

01:38:18

Yeah, wait.

01:38:23

Oh, shoko.

01:38:32

There anyone i can catch all of these guys things.

01:38:38

It's not looking like it.

01:38:46

You know, looks like i can get the five, the max so i will do just that. Huh.

01:38:56

Critical five foot step down.

01:39:01

And then cast a cone spell and i want to get this, right? So how do i we click use spell and then use an like i want to be able to target it like i want to be able to direct it.

01:39:20

Okay, never mind. Fuck me, i guess. Okay. So on spells like that, you need to set them up. I thought i thought a lot of stuff isn't set up like that, you have to go in and manually. Do it on the spelling, your character sheet. So we're going to template type 30 foot tone,

01:39:51

I'm set up a big animation for it and everything. Oh no. All right, try again.

01:40:06

Okay. Now, i'm looking at the template when i click it it'll just immediately fire it. So how do i aim it? Do i click and hold? No, just don't click it and rotate it with your mouse mouse wheel with my okay, mouse wheel. Okay, let's see if this works the way.

01:40:23

I think it should.

01:40:37

But did not quite go off the way. I thought it would influence like the animation, though.

01:40:53

If i target shell, go and use it woke up where i thought, no, you've got it set up to go off on target and it's something to do with the template. The template has to like select all of them as target for you.

01:41:08

What you probably could do is remove the template thing, however that works in the spell from creating one and just like control, click all of them or shift, click all the targets, show us what the cone first manually by drawing it. And then just click all the ones that are affected and then try using the spell that way and it might run the animation on all of them for the future.

01:41:32

Yeah. Uh, for now, i'll just make my apartment. How much i beat them? Is that how that work? Sands because i can see you sometimes. Like, obviously i can't see the box, but i can tell you're like dragging a box across tokens. Do you like control? Click or shift?

01:41:47

Click to add more to your selected tokens. Uh ships click. But you select multiple things or target multiple things?

01:42:02

Yeah, see i just targeted all five of those.

01:42:08

What i wanted to look like was to put the eyes on shoko and then the spirits rotating around everyone affected by it. I can i can help you with that later because i played with it a good amount you know. That that's just the source animation machine to change for that.

01:42:23

I can show you. It's really quick. I can show you when we're done later. If you want, i can help you set that up. It should be pretty fast.

01:42:34

Uh, so yeah, that should shake up the mammoth, the two whites and the two whore, prosperous amount affect the mammoth at all. It's busy goes 36. Sorry i was trying to take that as zero but somehow i went to Celestial, you know, it's like oh god, on the other hand, everything else is chicken.

01:43:04

My music just starts playing. Don't go dun dun, that's a lot of perfect. They're shaking.

01:43:24

I'm awesome. Hold on. Anything else where you sir? No, that'll be. It thunder takes one more turn-office paralysis, he does.

01:44:08

Uh i might go is down. Look shaka. The chocolate. Got any healing because i'm echo is dying. No, she didn't have any spells at all. Oh, oh. Fuck my life. What am i doing? I'm going back to Omn because they're excuse me. Okay, weigh-in uses. Lay on pause.

01:44:42

I was just reading that archetype the other day. I'm like when would you like i wouldn't feel comfortable with like a familiar running around as my source of healing. It's too easy to get squished and then here comes way in well. Yeah, because they did free booths as familiars free here over and over again, he puts her out of her misery.

01:45:09

With one non-lethal damage places. He's smothers her into the snow. I'm the emperor now.

01:45:26

He just killed her. He he like you were right way ad starts doing the Loki. Monologue, is it not more natural for you to kneel?

01:45:47

To come to me for help.

01:45:55

You must be truly desperate to come to me fail. Now, we'll check. Okay has already moved. Well, it's decided i liked your way and voice before Didien, but now you have to make your best Tom hillstone. You just you send me what you want me to say, and i'll try and do a Tom hiddleston for William.

01:46:21

That is unfortunate miss yesterday. What is the end of her turn? That's okay. No shaping for like pretty around. They shouldn't be. Boom. Boom. It's white swings at all. He miss, he does with all the time this again.

01:46:54

Oh, dear and mayco really gets beat up a lot. Paralyzed sandra is he helpless as a paralyzed person. Can he get crew to grad by an elephant right now? Could technically be good? Yes. But it's not going to consider crime. They're not smart enough for that. It's just gonna squish him.

01:47:17

It damn near does, that's almost bloodied

01:47:39

Um, minus eight is 19, so nine damage.

01:47:54

And then it slams or lemon his one. Now he's he's five foot stepped in his full attacking paralyzed sandra into the dust. No, no, this isn't a good sandru. Oh okay. This is a different mastodon mammoth. Oh okay i was like this is a bit much. This is really dark.

01:48:20

What's?

01:48:29

Excuse me. Excuse me. Don't tell mom video, you got two mammoths that are both squishing against people who can't defend, well, know how much is it. Now, he isn't back from.

01:48:58

Yeah, i'm there, i'm looking at how i want. How many targets i want to below this shit up right now.

01:49:11

First moment, i can only hit three about blasting somebody else.

01:49:19

Bad fucking damn it. I don't want to, i don't want to make it hurt anybody's feelings, but i don't think i've ever seen. You hit with your template on the first try? Give you a nice. Yeah, you're right. It's really deceptive like where the squares are. But look at where the squares are compared to the circle here.

01:49:40

Like it's it's kind of not. Oh it only shows you a circle. That makes more sense. I was like, don't you like click a dot and then it makes the template. I haven't used it. So i don't know how it works. That's what it should be.

01:50:02

And then happy again as much.

01:50:09

We had the other the other two, right?

01:50:27

They are still going. Trying to get the money no page and actually be going anymore.

01:50:46

But then again as much oh yeah, still up just not looking great.

01:50:55

I'll be right back, guys.

01:51:00

And kill the

01:51:08

Uh, count this guy to move.

01:51:14

I can't really move her with speedy on the same square.

01:51:24

Okay.

01:51:29

Show me where i'm guessing very properly an attack opportunity. There is in fact, for the mammoth have great reach. 15 feet.

01:51:49

She's fine. She has almost 100 health before it being hit and then swing once.

01:52:09

With room, you take your chunk out of that famous leg. And that's our turn. Boom, bringing us to skydney

01:52:31

Skydney is a very large boy and i put him in a box.

01:52:45

But he i think you can do that. Yeah, do it move. It's not doing it. I would like to put him here.

01:53:04

Oh there went and then crunch of mammoth. Yeah.

01:53:29

Unfortunately, not enough to hit the mammoth.

01:53:35

And he will growl at him very deep and scary. I can't do it.

01:53:45

This thing. Boom, that beauty stand.

01:54:02

If sky getting not friend, why friend shaped

01:54:13

Uh, stagnese and not your friend. I know.

01:54:27

Oh, right. Swings at a mako.

01:54:36

Boo. Boo. Make those games. Amigo is getting wailed on.

01:54:50

He's become quite sturdy.

01:54:56

Oh, final step down and uh, Sandra is getting stepped on on the coast being stabbed on the ground. But Sandra has a big wolf show going killed around her on the cohes the guide and a monkey.

01:55:18

Uh she will targets these uh advanced white down here. Advanced frosty friends.

01:55:55

The one that hits does just enough damage. You're not going to zero, it's the first thing since he's undead.

01:56:05

All right.

01:56:09

Eventually, it was raining well ahead and ammo actually.

01:56:19

Uh, we're technically not tracking mundane ammo quantities, okay? At least that's what i've been previously told, which is why i haven't been on Grayson years ago. Boom, 15 years ago. We discussed that. Yeah. Like special magical ammo and such. Yeah, definitely track.

01:56:45

Brush yourself drew and she's gonna do one more that everyone got pretty fucked up.

01:56:57

Circle is somehow fine.

01:57:03

Do with my characters. I'm taking no hits this entire combat.

01:57:20

And she he'll be on that samurai. Nope.

01:57:30

Did she she missed him every time she channeled to damage, right?

01:57:38

Uh, she selective channel avoided him.

01:57:51

You do what a shame.

01:58:00

So, thank you should be down to two rounds of hair being palette, right? Yeah. Yeah.

01:58:23

I love pathfinder. This is like really intense and when you read it as raw, it's a this is like 20 seconds of fight. That this whole thing goes down in. Piano flies. Once more around the group hauntingly laughing.

01:58:47

All right. Could someone cast singing visibility? So we can get this girl very soon if only see invisibility did something for this. So, just just going on back and forth. In the ethereal plane. She's she's a spirit. We have somebody in general chat for some reason, but general voice.

01:59:09

Perfect wants to look out and see if there is more undead approaching us. Or if this is it. Boom, you don't see any more approaching, okay?

01:59:36

I think probably one of those hits the

01:59:47

Only one of them has but it's a good chunk of damage.

01:59:56

Let's do it. Please turn ochi only has one turn of kamikaze left because stuff so he is going to zoom

02:00:12

I'm sorry, first. He's going to spend the key point to zoom.

02:00:23

Then he's gonna zoom.

02:00:38

Getting to getting to there. I don't know if this thing can be fainted, but i'm sure as heck gonna try

02:00:47

You are welcome to try. He gets i get like a minus eight, right? And that what that is. Yeah. And it has a theme of 36.

02:01:03

Hell yeah.

02:01:10

Am i flanking? I with multiple people, perfect.

02:01:24

Are you spring attacking? I am not spring attacking if he has a tax of opportunity, he may take them

02:01:37

Big room that he did it on kilda. Yes this is still the same way he's walking held up. They do not. Add the double check, that would be scary.

02:01:59

Boom. Boom. Beautiful.

02:02:06

Oh, she smash. This is pretty much exactly what happened and that's gonna be ochie's turn. That's my turn.

02:02:23

Well, spiffy. Oh wow.

02:02:45

Fly out to the bear.

02:02:50

That it is several attacks opportunity.

02:02:56

All right. Trying to make it. Where she's can see that. We unless it have opportunity wasn't spiffy always 15 feet up. No, see if they come down the hill. Look shaka. Oh okay. And then she's going to channel the harm. Some undead want my character heed to do this.

02:03:20

God damn.

02:03:33

Did not roll with damage.

02:03:40

Now, did

02:03:48

20 21, 19 gets the gospel on that. That would be nice. What did i say? 2021 19.

02:04:13

Right, that's three. It well.

02:04:23

Already anything else for sure? Nope, that's it. Bringing us to earth. It's of time to shine, baby.

02:04:39

Off is going to five foot step there.

02:04:52

Wait weapon and shield combat style?

02:04:59

Oh, i'm helpful. Yeah, wolf wolf combat sales weapon and shield. Oh i see. Okay, is this?

02:05:23

Also, one of the examples of a character i didn't modify at all. There's just straight out of the book and that body was quite successful that first tag obliterates that white.

02:05:45

And then the shield wouldn't hit the horror frost beer with it.

02:05:52

Okay, i'm not supposed to be targeting this one. Here, they'll be finding for 15 and still. No, i don't, i don't see anything in that square.

02:06:11

Other heart prosper. It right here. I see one there. And here, that's weird because there is no corporal spirit in that first. Thought we gotta know. There's one in between interesting. That's okay. I guess it's a good thing. That was a five foot step, huh? That's the true.

02:06:50

Or cross spirit it's gonna pull attack old and miss with everything. Heck. Yeah.

02:07:28

Choco. Uh, circle will use the movement to go. Find like 10. 15 20, get on the other side of this guy to get blanking.

02:07:55

And then swing at him.

02:08:28

And,

02:08:36

Yeah. Well, anything else for you? Oh no. That'll be that fundrew's final round of paralysis. Actually. No. He's still has one after this. Yep. His final round of paralysis.

02:09:03

I don't think he's going to get to do anything but so he's not are ever. So, graceful swashbuckler has spent the entire fights based down ass up.

02:09:28

A makeo takes a move action to get back to her feet.

02:09:56

Yeah, you see how the targeted three of them with that template. Yeah, i do see that. That is weird. Oh my god, seriously.

02:10:08

Fucking way is kill steals, two hoardrobster. Oh, is that really enough to kill both of them? Yeah, that's beautiful. Incredible. Continue the recovery. A dead one, and there somewhere.

02:10:29

I'm gonna go. All right, we're just gonna call this then because all that's left is a single frost white and i really, really need to be. Yeah, that was sick. I had a great time with that. Congratulations. Everyone not a single casualty incredible. Uh, tobacco died for me pulling punches though.

02:10:51

Yeah, a mako nearly died, several times and sand drew was at risk of death. The entire time almost died too. Like you guys you guys mitigated and pivoted in that fight to keep people up? Like you thought in strategically, it was well done and i just blasted things with fireball and as the the last of the undead, both of the ground.

02:11:26

The unnamed samurai shields his golden blade and walk straight over to ochi.

02:11:37

Thank you. I was the last samurai of the house vomitatsu.

02:11:47

I will be the rebirth.

02:11:53

What is your name?

02:11:59

My name was never important. That's so sick.

02:12:06

And he just lays this golden katana with a phoenix pattern on the black. I can't remember discovered? Yeah i can't remember either my brain is that i it is a plus one. Holy katana. That's so cool. He lays it in the snow. Yep, that's your feet before he manages and go through his eternal rest.

02:12:35

Having completed his final sworn duty to protect the path of the matatsu, did he? Like uh, just like totally disappeared. Did you just like fall over face? First of the snow and like, saying to the ground or something? Nope, he fades into nothing. That's so awesome. He was a spirit ochi.

02:12:53

First of all says a little prayer for him and all these uh people joins you who wants to live. Yeah. And then he's gonna gingerly pick up the katana and pull it out and like scope it out. So, when you pick up the katana, there's also a small ceramic statuette hanging, or on in the snow beneath it in the shape of a horse, it is the terracotta talisman a terracotta horse, another one that's sick.

02:13:36

Oh she will pick that up too and just put it in his belt pouch for right now um assuming grace and everybody saw this go on and him pick all this stuff up. He's not like shasting it. He's just, we're very tired.

02:13:52

All right, i gotta go. Let's look at a feed my animals and then go talk to the teaching maker game. Okay, shoko. Do you magnets, do you have time? Do you want me to show you how to tweak that animation stuff? Oh yeah. That would be nice. Okay, so we've only got a few minutes.

02:14:09

I'm gonna need to switch the server to the king maker game when i get back, that's okay. Can you throw somebody up just a target? I guess, we can target somebody else. Never mind. That's fine, literally. Yeah. Yeah, we love a lot. I thought not quite i thought the same thing racing.

02:14:25

I was like level nine question mark. Oh no i run. Yeah, you wear level nine after this. Yo this is awesome. Make this frost weight, a member of the caravan? Yeah, we knock his arms off and pull his teeth out and keep it with us. He follows us around.

02:14:46

No, i was terrible. I'm leaving call him in jean. Okay, so i can't like edit your spell but i'm going to go look at the menu on something of mine. We'll go to my challenge. Uh can we can we get out of an initiative so that oh we can?

02:15:04

Nope, not anymore. Here he already left. Sands already left. Um yeah, i don't know how to do that but so we should be able to do this without doing that. We'll have to test it some other time but uh go. You know, where to go, right? Get back into the animation menu and they're right now.

02:15:25

Okay? So you obviously know that you can set up multiple animations, right? Right. Oh, maybe i'm wrong on this animation.

02:15:38

Huh, that's interesting. I may be wrong right off the bat. Oh no no. So there's source, animation, secondary animation and target animation, right? Yeah. So we'll leave our token type like on token for right now. That doesn't there's kind of like two of the same menus. Same thing as with the buffs thing.

02:15:59

So for target animation, you're going to check that one and you're going to go in and you're going to pick the effect that you wanted of like the skull swirling. And you'll change it to that. And i think the way to do it is, like i said, measure it with the cone first, but don't necessarily like tie that into the spell, like Sans had it just pick someone in the center of where your cone is going to go and then you kind of get to place where your animation is going to play.

02:16:26

You see what i'm saying? Not really. Oh, sort of. Like, i remember, we had a fifth, you select targets. Uh, yeah. So here's what we'll try. Do me a favor right now and just pick any target animation and assign it to the animations for the miasmal dread. Like you're going to use that right?

02:16:49

Just pick literally anything that'll play on it shifted. Targeted everyone. Uh, yeah. And then make sure that you've checked target animation on the animation menu on the spell and just pick one and submit and close. And then fire off, just press use on the spell and see if it plays it on everybody individually.

02:17:34

Okay.

02:17:39

So you had everybody targeted. It did it on everybody so that. Yeah, yeah, i shift targeted. Everyone they did on everyone instead of just the people in the cone. Uh, so i guess i'll have to figure out where my account is, and then manually target just those people per to affect.

02:18:00

Yes, but you should be able to i was trying to play with this, but i didn't want to do it until i could like macro it. So they want to use my ability. It also applied above to my target and i kind of gave up because i didn't want to get that far into it, but i think maybe if you change the animation type from the drop down at the top to range, we might be able to separate and have the eyes play on.

02:18:22

Just your token. And then the skull swirling just play on the target.

02:18:32

All right.

02:18:38

Yeah. So source animation, that'll be you. So, you would set that to the eyes one, which is cool on what i use for forgotten trick. And then target animation. Do the spell swirly skull thing. The only problem here is that when i switch targeted, it targeted it to range.

02:18:57

I am i lose the ability to do the the breath weapon part of it. It do you remember? What's up menu? It was under.

02:19:11

Uh, yeah. It was um, wait, no, no. It was a i had to go to templates and i had to go to animation and i go to type home and it automatically put it to breath weapon.

02:19:31

So, but what was the actual animation? What was the actual animation for the for them? My asthma, the skull swirling thing you had going on was that what was supposed to be on your token? In general, the eyes and the skull circling you? No, the eyes were just supposed to be on me.

02:19:49

Those full swirling was supposed to be on. Everyone else is what i had in mind because i never saw any of the breath weapon. Animation happened. When you did it did you do like poison or something? Nice. Um near, let me click it again.

02:20:35

Oh, it's really lagging out. Yeah that's a lot but see i didn't see any like breath weapon type thing. Come out of you. You didn't see that there. No, you're not going. I didn't see it happen in the comb, maybe it's because there's so much green cone going on, but i only saw the eyes in the skull swirling around each individual token.

02:20:54

Also, i don't know how to get rid of the template now. Um, here, i want to try something, let me try mine. I'm gonna try and set something up for me and see if it works the way. I think it's going to work. That'll be a little bit easier.

02:21:09

Source animation, we'll go with magic sign. I don't know. Token border. Yes, that's orange.

02:22:18

Sorry, i thought this would be a little bit easier. I played with this for a long time, just to get money to do it. I wanted to and then still didn't get as far as i wanted.

02:22:58

Okay, where are you at shoko, there you are.

02:23:05

I do not have the right character selected.

02:23:12

All right, i'm going to try it again. I'm trying to do one on you.

02:23:22

Sorry, i had you covered up with my with myself. No, it did. Both of them on you, which is not what i wanted.

02:23:43

All right, so now i've selected shift, click selected, all the creatures who should be in the cone of effect which should just be the white. No way on a and the monkey.

02:24:06

You see that breath at all? Oh yeah, i see it now. Okay, cool. So, i think i'm starting to figure this out a little bit, so, can you tell me which animations, you have selected under, which checkboxes

02:24:25

There's source primary, secondary and target. Okay, source. I didn't have a source animation checked. Okay, i should probably do that. No, because that's turning off and on animation. And what we had was the eyes popping up on you and this goes popping up on you. Uh, we didn't want the skulls, we didn't want the eyes and we wanted the miasma to go into cone, which was good.

02:24:58

So what was your primary one set to? My primary is the breathlessly.

02:25:13

And then secondary or target? Did you have those selected at all? Uh, yes. Secondary, i have set to the eyes target. I have set to the swirling spirits. What i think i should do, is, i should take, i should unclick. Secondary and have eyes set to the source animation.

02:25:35

Yes. And that's what i was going to suggest.

02:25:42

I don't know how to remove primary animation. I guess you could just make it the same thing as your source. No. Because then it still showed up on the other character when i did it.

02:26:13

Okay. Close your menus for a second and let's watch because i just tried one for me.

02:26:23

All right now, now click it again.

02:26:41

And orange around choco. Yeah, see. So that's what i did. I have. All right now let's see if mine's works better now. So the way that i did mine to get one on me and one on the other one is i had source animation and primary animation, and you can add secondary.

02:27:00

So, your source animation should be set to eyes and eyes shouldn't be on any of the other ones. You know what i mean?

02:27:11

Yeah.

02:27:15

To the eyes pop up. I missed the first bit of it. Uh, i don't think they did, let me try that again. Yeah, they should be set to source, your source. Animation should be checked and you should change that to the eyes. And what you can also do, like i was going to say is you can further go into the options if you want to make it look extra cool.

02:27:37

Every time you could pick someone in the middle of your cone and just choose them as the target like we were talking about doing manually and you can increase the radius. So it makes a big circle of swirling skulls, that kind of fills out the space. That the cone would take up.

02:27:55

I was trying to do them because i like made macros that do my forgotten trick stuff into uh kamikaze and shadow clone. So like when i do kamikaze, they're all messed up right now but they roughly go. In order of me using all my abilities key pool, the animation, i chose for forgotten trick and then two different animations to illustrate like kamikaze your shadow poem.

02:28:21

So if you watch my token, all is doing it on you now because i have you targeted but not doing half of them. Oh, i ran out of key, lol.

02:28:51

There it is. That's basically perfect. Well, there we go. Kind of complicated stuff. It's just, it's not like super self-explanatory, you know what i mean? I played with it for a while, to get it, to do what i wanted. Like, i was trying to get them to delay so that they happen in order.

02:29:09

So i get the poof from the key pool, then the eyes for him, like remembering how to do a trick or learning how to do a trick and then for like kamikaze the blood squirting out first and then like the red waves around him or for shadow, clone the little like misty step after all those animations and there's like a delay thing so you can actually order them like that.

02:29:31

So if you wanted, you can go to the delay section and options and put like 2000 milliseconds on the other two. I'd covered in my new. So your eyes happen, first, and it's scary and then you spit out the breath. You know what i mean? Yeah, yeah. I think he's kicking us out right now because he needed us to get off.

02:29:55

So you should probably hop out of the boundary. Oh wait, i just picked up play. Mark noise. All right. I'm bouncing out a foundry hopping off. I'll see you guys next. Hey, take it easy everybody. Good game 15 later. Yeah.
