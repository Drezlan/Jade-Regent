00:00

That's pretty simple. This thing, it's because we ran away. We i'll take a glass stand at this. Like dome place that i think it was both recommended because they're supposed to be like a samurai spirit that would help travelers and their time of need if necessary and sure enough he did show up and everybody controlled quite a few people and we managed to pull through despite Sandra getting messed up.

00:36

Pretty early on been unable to like do anything for quite a few rooms and all of the rounds. I think the big note thing was that, what's her name? The evil lady that we killed her spirit showed up. That was like, flying around taunting and said. So, she must still be out here.

00:57

I don't know. Like huntiness somehow yes. Um, we actually finished that fight in the tower at the top of the tower before, all this happened and then we came down and then it was the big chase. And we went like 500 miles to whatever this hill is called with no sleep.

01:15

We got one rest out of like doing it and shifts. While the wagons were moving, and that's it. And i realized as soon as we pulled this up that i did not level up to level 9. I'm handling that right now, so i'll do that very quickly. I have all my stuff picked out already.

01:31

I just have to throw it on my sheet.

01:44

All of my intrigue stuff. Starts coming online this level, which is just in time for us to get to minkai, i must have missed whatever it is, but it's probably not gonna make it this week.

01:59

Uh, she should make it. I was talking to where this morning so i was just checking because um there's the most been something that you put in in general because i didn't realize there was any talk of canceling this week and then you sent something last night. So, i was just wondering what happened?

02:18

Who did we lose? Oh, look at them. All right, i did put it generally. Yes. I clicked on general, as i said that no voice chat. Yeah, so i just sorry i wasn't following the general. So, let me just go do my several quick, but that was essentially it, we finished the fight, we broke the grace and broke the crystals, which shut down the tower.

02:43

And the storm moved away towards the wall of heaven. Um, and we are like, that's ominous and the it ripped out, like, with electricity. The soul of the, the big bad whose name, i don't know either. Um and then she was like circling this whole fight appearing and disappearing somehow and her ghost form.

03:06

Um yeah. And so the storm is not gone. It's just no longer controlled and blocking the path of agony and my thing is actually on my phone. So,

03:26

Hey abs, i'm taking a bunch of bad spells and beats the solo. Speaking of i used path builder and i remember ditty and had said, oh, is it as good as to e, which i still haven't really looked at? I looked at the some of the two e stuff this last week, it looked at the path builder for two E and oh my god, where why didn't that do you do all that for for one E?

03:51

Because the the two he one is incredible. Right there. It is pretty great. I'm also, this level. What did you do? I haven't done anything yet. That's what i was saying. I need to go and drop everything on my sheet because i have a plan, but i never came in and actually leveled up taking a bunch of bags, super situation stuff because i've been, i'm tired of of, actually being helpful, you see?

04:17

Yeah, and quite literally like underravel through the front of my fucking head. The last time we played, i'm going to assume that you guys will never go plus session. Ah, yes, we finished the fight and you did great just so you know. Yeah. Sorry if that was us by the way, but don't you away?

04:41

Like it was, it was a mix of several things, none of, which was any yellows bottle. So it was mainly like so it's it's very rare that i get compound headaches, that are that bad. Um it was bad enough that the next day i called my doctor and got like and you will subscription prescription.

05:09

Um, it's very much so it's not you. Um, so don't think about that. And it came off. Otherwise that, that wasn't the thing. It's just, i could not handle.

05:32

No, i was understandable. I didn't think it was us. I was airing on the side of like we're not that bad. So no, no. I literally felt like my skull was trying to break out of my head. Um was not fun. Here's the fun question that i ask. Every time we level up.

05:53

What is the taking the average on a d10? A six.

06:04

It's a very good thing that i have something i have i have no i planned out for like ever. Um, fuck. Oh, maybe not actually shit. This is the one model i didn't plan.

06:33

Basically everything else business a level where i get to redo spells and stuff.

06:47

Oh,

06:53

Oh, this is one of those of us.

06:59

So i can shuffle out something. I'm not used in a while.

07:20

Have been used, nearly any of my first levels in a long time.

07:30

Oh yes, i forgot how often zeo was trying to murder sangre last week.

07:39

What do you mean? All of his spells were targeting sandra.

07:52

Maybe maybe commune with birds. So i get rid of the birds guys, it's been really fun. It's, i'll leave that up to you. Don't do it. All right. You like talking to OG? Ah, it's getting kind of i delete, i delete me in with. I i delete commune with birds and all of presents, uh, speech through my head.

08:15

I was just turns into squawking absolutely as soon. That's what you guys aren't doing, right?

08:36

So many buffs.

08:42

There were a few other RP. Things that happened. Particularly for, oh cheese. That is true. I'm sorry. I didn't bring that up. Um, the cool flavor that happened because i believe. Abby. I can't remember if Abby was already gone for this part. Um i tried to rule knowledge on this guy with my very very important lore sword masters and couldn't remember anything but then i asked him after the fight, what his name was?

09:05

I'll back up. He bowed down before a mako towards the beginning of this whole fight. Um and then fought alongside us and did some really good work in this general area of holding the line and then after OT started zooming around doing his OG thing, he was over here and the guy was over here and he said, what is your name after the fight?

09:32

And he said it's not important and then he laid down a plus one, holy katana at oh she's feet and said something to the effect of i was the last of the defenders of the emotazu and i've done my work. Now, i pass this on to you sort of a deal.

09:47

That's a very paraphrased version of what happened. But that's how i remember it.

10:00

Pardon, i shall take your word for it. Yes.

10:10

So so i've made a few jokes about how crease in his only knowledge skill is history and he's never got a chance to roll it. This will campaign server. I thought about it a little more i realized. Oh i probably will never be able to because i've been maintained that Grayson knows nothing about me kai and anything so how would he know any of the history?

10:31

So unused probably for the rest of the campaign. He could spend some time in the library. Getting to know the history of minkai. Yeah, you could just continue knowing nothing. I'll leave that up to you. Hey didion. I think you did some fancy stuff to increase my land speed.

10:52

The first time i took the warrior public go fast flourish, um, because the version that i had on my sheet, doesn't do any changes to my land speed, but i know it's accurate so far. Do you know anything about what i'm talking about?

11:11

Exodus of janine. It's in like the top of my features and you have two of them because you can take it multiple times and i do duplicate it because i couldn't find it in the archetype thing. And then i was looking at it and there's no changes in it.

11:25

So i don't know how you made my speed faster when i like took this at like level one because i have 50, i should only have 40 if i'm getting the 10 from koya, i was just wondering because i don't want him to stack. Whatever 10 foot you gave me before, i don't want to have.

11:40

I mean, i do want to have 80 feet of movement, but i don't deserve it yet.

11:48

So if you've taken Exodus of June twice, right? Yes, so they provides you a 20 foot boost here. Movement speed. Oh, we'll just write it in on the one. Okay, i want to know. I got you. I got you. Don't worry, boom. Boom, is there. We're just gonna put land speeds since you don't have any other types of speeds.

12:09

Sure.

12:14

Works on land speed anyways and it's untyped. Okay? So,

12:28

Vegan. I'm saying i now have like another 10 beyond what i'm supposed to have, because there's 10 affecting it from somewhere, i should have 30 for being a tangu, 20 for the flourish, and then another 10 for koi's buff. But i have 70 instead of 60. Did you write it in?

12:47

Is that what happened? Wait, you get 10 from being a tengo 30. 30 base speed for being a tengo, right? Okay. 20 for the flourish, 10 from koya. That's 60. I think you just wrote it because you can edit the thing here.

13:07

You know, i imagining you did something funky. I love it. Looks like i who set your base land speed to 40. Yeah, you have four levels of ninja. Does i give you a movement speed boost? No, that's it's activated with the key pool. So you just changed my base speed.

13:20

When i took it the first time, it's, we didn't do changes on the thing. So i have to edit it to 30. That's that's really too big. It was that there we go. Okay. Sorry for all that confusion. I was just like, there's something there's some fuckery going on here.

13:37

Appreciate the honesty. Okay? How have our planned out? Literally i remember the level for this stupid bitch but not level 9. This is so annoy.

13:58

The problem is smarter to grab like a car still but i kind of want to change my necromancy spell out so like i can feel like taking dirts bar really meant something.

14:15

Looking at all, the first level was our necromancy spells right now. I'm trying not to decide which one would still be useful this late.

14:41

Sword.

15:02

Not sure who doesn't care but much about whether a spell is evil or not. So, I'll take that.

15:27

So i think i got all my stuff. Did everybody else level up? No way. I know you said you didn't have a plan uh shoko i'm working on it. Luckily most of mrs, fella easy. I'm just deciphering which one of these options actually. Yeah, i'm gonna cover your, you guys's stuff with some rp here, grace, and did you already have your level up done and blind out and everything?

15:49

I guess i can just read the chat. That would be smart, huh? Relatively simple since i don't have spells to pick. Yeah, yeah. I'm all done uh, way too big.

16:12

I need to do skills. I'm sorry, i'm already either. I was gonna rp but building op characters. Building barely effective characters. Just comes first.

16:28

Give a look at something in your like this is aggressively. So multiple, but very funny. Yeah, you just you take some warrior public levels and then you'd stop taking warrior. Poet levels. Yeah. Yeah. It's in the vein of that. That's more or less what i'm done here. I took a bunch of things that shoko specifically would be good at but aren't actually all that useful in a broad range of situations.

17:01

So,

17:12

Like, i could still.

17:24

One of these is like it makes sense and it's still not really optimal, but it is actually panical at that toxic toxicological timing. Mmm. I've read that one. I forget what it does. Uh toxicological timing is required for improved toxicological timing. And basically, it makes poison action bible because all of the poison that takes forever to onset, you just it's onset.

17:49

Becomes immediate in maths away. It undoes math. Yeah, you you reduce the onset value by up to one day? So anything that's like oh it doesn't kick in for an hour. I was like, nope, it happens, man, it happens right now. Hell. Yeah, still waiting for my supposed poison drinks.

18:10

Okay, okay, fine. All right now that's what we're doing now. That's we doing now. Thanks. Grayson got him. Not even joking forest size and resigns herself to preparing neutralized poison for the rest of the trip.

18:46

Do you know of a way? I've been putting this off for a long time? Hold on. The i at one point, tried to add two languages for one of my linguistics, linguistics ranks and i added them as one entry with a comma. I don't think i have the power to delete language entries.

19:02

Didian. Do you possess this power? Yeah, under languages. I only have checkboxes. And then i custom field. I don't have a way to remove one that's already on my sheet. Oh no, i do. I'm sorry. Oh my gosh.

19:26

I'm for all the mpcs to go back to the npc folder.

19:38

Oh no, i do have to do it that way. Okay, that's fine.

19:44

Um, speaking of the npcs gosh, it was a couple months ago. I think you mentioned, you were gonna make devotion buffs for npcs that we got that were close to that. Uh, didn't automatically come with one, but i never happen or did i or not? I have not made the buffs yet.

20:04

Uh most of you are only halfway towards where you need to be to get the buff. I think a couple of you are close with like a single NVC.

20:22

Here's my players. I will look into that later that was even a thing. No, there are very useful buffs that they provide.

20:38

Sure. Go spend some more time brewing and worrying to actually bond with people. Yes, thank you for the reminder racing because i forgot.

20:59

That everyone, everyone that this starts wearing as human guys as we get closer to mankai, by the way, he said a little a lot brighter than someone who recognizing

21:21

Anything about

21:28

Hello. Pitbull spells on a clerk. What's that? Righteous might also blame shake divine powers this level back. Right? Just might sixth. Yeah, that's a good stuff. Pitbull spells they're good. Okay, toxicological timing.

22:34

Remember, we were before, we took off on this whole journey, like the lady at the village. Told us like where we could start where we could expect to start finding settlements again. Are we roughly at that point now? Oh, you're certainly getting there.

24:05

Know, i had some sort of epiphany about toxins throughout this journey

24:15

Mako might not have dropped so often if i had. Realized she was level behind everyone. Oh yeah. Oh no.

24:28

She did fairly well, even regard it regardless.

24:39

Okay, leveling for her is easy for like four more levels humor levels to get those brain steed. That.

24:55

Wait, deeds like like swashbuckler dates? Yep, she's a virtuous bravo. Oh,

25:06

She is the nimble paladin.

25:13

My will admit when i first read the butch was Bravo and print. I was speaking with shades at the time and the exact words that came out of my mouth was oh, fuck off.

25:25

But it blends so beautifully with devoted, muse. Yeah. This is before the voting us was printed now and i was just like, okay, you're just gonna you're just gonna make next the damage that much better or death, got it. Oh and they got to keep their the guys. Okay, but they don't get they don't get smite.

25:50

Now i don't get their christmas oracy with their smite. They still get smite. Exactly. Exactly to go. They don't get full size. Like i did. No, they get the good parts of smity, you misunderstand.

26:10

I don't, i don't dislike it at all. I think actually it's a really solid class. I just think it's one of those ones. Unfortunately. That's very good for dips. Definitely it does front load real quick.

26:26

Hey, so now i've got to look up the Poison less than find my notes of the ones that actually work.

26:47

Sure. I have a list somehow, and when ochi asked me to look at some

29:37

And everyone again, hold on. Like i should have done this before this session.

29:48

I'm ready. Whenever now i'm done, i'm just looking up other stuff on the side. For please pay no attention to always increasingly frankly stupid collection of minor poisons.

30:06

We will find something that won't kilograms and eventually,

30:13

That's not the plan for what it's worth.

30:34

Gotta be something here.

30:43

So i feel a little bit like i'm missing out on some stuff by the fact that i didn't play rise and i'm playing jade beforehand. Uh, but you've all played rise at this point, i have never finished, right? Actually i've never been gotten into book two, this is the only AP i've ever done.

31:05

Furthest i got was, i believe the very back end of three. Um, but yeah, i like it's a test. Okay, about to the end of five, but honestly, you're not missing out on too much. Like amiko is in rise of the room lords, but she's the hero. Yeah, she's she's the damn slow.

31:31

You rescue as like, your first big mission? That's it. And you she wallops her dad with a ladle. And you go to her tavern, you can become friends with her but she's not a major part of the story.

31:54

I would still like to experience the whole storyline. I just i'm running it after rap. I'm gonna run rise shattered star and return for you guys after rap. Because i want, i want to finish the trilogy. Brides, return is the only adventure path. That was one through 20 without an ethic.

32:23

Most of the others get to 18.

32:37

No. There's definitely some stuff i could make that might be able to to get through a grayson's.

32:48

Palette.

33:04

You don't need you don't need like your strength or your wisdom for anything, right? Are you kidding me? Those are the only things i need. Oh good. Good. She says having i think something else suspicious into a violin. Given it a shagly is he i see.

33:28

The job of your head. What happens if you takeaway someone's sense of ego and curtis? Fine. Right.

33:46

Um, no like a cocktail shaker, right? This is, there's no go scratches of his head, i guess they'd still technically be breathing.

34:08

See, i think i found a way to potentially target the the frontal cortex, which if i'm thinking correctly, won't be as bad as the neurotoxin that you're experienced earlier, but will give a sense of particular stickification to an individual. Assuming it's allowed to take, but it just narrows her eyes at you.

34:34

So you're cooking up a roofie. No, no no, no, no. I can make that pretty easily this thing though.

34:50

And don't worry. Go away. It'll be curable. I'll make antitoxins.

35:01

By the way, this is the next day. I assumed everyone like set up shop and fucking slept. Perhaps absolutely. Now we all died.

35:16

I wonder if i can make a poison that. Hmm.

35:28

As Abby remembers like to particular types of poison that exist and is like, mmm, we're getting to the point i can make those

35:41

That i buy enough poisonous material to make it. Trying to make deadly toxin died. Ice is not really a fan.

36:36

Oh yeah, the polyglot monitors off. Yeah. Okay good.

36:44

I love it. Conceptually is president.

36:54

Or no. I said it's default language. It's a common again. It's default language to change for some reason.

37:20

So what what does, what does noise chemistry experiments look like? Oh, like, like my mind immediately went to like nile red. Like i've got a highly toxic chemical compound here and i'm gonna try to set it on fire. Funny. You should say exactly that. Because one of the things that you see her shaking in NASA in the tomb fuel is this very luscious almost ruby, red liquid but upon like popping the top of it it catches air and seems to like spur off.

37:57

It's like okay, okay. All right. What are you always uh, with magic and can i borrow your fancy fingers for just a moment. I promise this won't hurt should go size and get some. All right, so don't worry first. He looks over at zio's snoring and then he sighs and gets up.

38:25

Oh, don't worry. If i was going to test anything on him, i just used the big stuff. This one, and it could you just cop your hands for me, you know, has your has your hands, like put together and then puts this, uh, this this sphere of liquid just in the middle of the line.

38:42

Think very hard about. Um honestly i don't know how your magic works. It's gonna be honest. Uh, but just kind of yeah, it's hard to explain uh you want me to cast something, not precisely but i want you to think quite hard and if you can channel your force of will just into this item, i know.

39:09

That's a weird thing to ask ordinarily it. It'd be much more actually bite makes hand signs. It's like, but i can't do it. It's not really me. So, uh, i need someone who knows a little bit more about this. Um, i don't know. Use like uh what's that thing that you're always doing?

39:31

Um well i can order. I literally have a spell foreign that works on containers here up. Um, uh and uh, yeah, your vile empties.

39:55

Brows. Go up naturally by um,

40:03

So is this still in there or did you just purge it?

40:09

Uh, i i undo, i i, i smirk and then top the side of it and that comes right back. Oh my goodness rice. Okay, but no good good. Uh just just it's hold that i'm just focus on it. Very lightly for me, she says she pulls out like another small vial gives that a hard shake and it's just trying to support in his carefully as possible.

40:42

I just need something to eat just a while. I guess i'll try to take magic. And as you detect magic, the bottom of this. I'm fuel like almost closed for a couple seconds and then when the this black liquid gets put into it it's simmers down and thickens and just very calmly.

41:06

Settles. And just like, okay, detect evocation from this thing. Um, it is definitely poison but it would detective the vacation. So okay, okay. Now i'm draws out one of her lakashi's. It's like right? So if eyebrow quirks up, yeah, don't worry about it. And then just pores over like this liquid onto the blade and it like vanishes into the actual metal and then stays there.

41:45

It's like, okay.

41:50

All right.

41:54

So nice. Stop holding this. Now. Oh yeah sure she takes that. Okay. And just close it like somewhere and and the ice just don't worry about it. That's fine. We're good at that. Uh, fucking magnumar. Um, i had a friend good kennel art much more interested in the works of black fingers than i ever was.

42:19

But he had a Kanye eye for being able to mix and match things that should ever be married. This is one of them and she, she flicks the the end of the lock is actually. And you can see like the blades edge. Just spurt into fire just for a minute and then pops out again.

42:39

So yes. It's called flaming do which is bit of a grandiose name in my opinion, but it does the job that is something else. So you just what makes a difference than just setting your sword on fire. Well the second episode on fire, if you're not a certain 10, no suey usually just doesn't work and at worse.

43:09

You know, you can cause damage to the blades and best you might be able to get it a little bit warm. But this thing if it cooks into like tissue, what it should do is scald and burn it. And if it's actually, ah, going to make contact with farmable material, it should catch fire.

43:32

Um, that is pretty impressive. Oh, it's good. Good for like one to us but i'm still waiting on getting it being more. Stuffy. So it goes away after one cut, that's usually the way ahead with poisons, but they're always to keep it sticking around, i'm working on it. Whoa, good luck.

43:56

Don't set our caravan on fire. Believe me, i'm not intending to and she's very gingerly puts the story back here. It's like none of that. None of that. But there's some more interesting things that's kind of my enjoy that a black toxin. Gave me an idea bearing intensifies. Okay, so something that's weird.

44:32

Uh, i shoko speaks parisian so coya's. Text says translated from barium. I could like i can see what she says, but i don't see ogs. That's because ochi is using versions sign language. Oh, okay. Oh, g took a rank of linguistics last level and this level. So i filled in like four more languages because verb things came into work with box or something already or i suppose that pantomime in shadow box.

45:04

At this point, i actually think if we wanted to have a super good, i guess it is a brain thing. I kind of pictured it as more of like a bird's easily imitate the actual vocal cord movements that create languages, that is true. So varician sign language rules as intended you could argue that he doesn't get it as easily and would have to actually spend it foreign linguistics but he likes coyote.

45:29

So he would put in the effort. I understand the respect this entirely. Yes, i was delighted when it popped up on the screen. Actually he was just like she's gonna kill all of us. Can you can you cure all of her juice? It's sign language. Equivalent was like, yeah, i got you i couldn't quite figure out how to add more languages to my languages is you're using one that isn't a checkbox.

45:57

You can just in the custom box at the bottom. Just put a comma after each of them and it will put them in a separate and separate entries and on the languages dropped down in the chat. You could select each of them individually and most of the big nations have their own individual form of sign language.

46:13

Yeah. Okay. Yeah, i put a comma after in between the two of them, it's still like the same box. If you know, close it, save update button and it will appear at the sunset right. Language on your list. It shows up in one box but you can still use them separately in the chat and then you could just read them off the character.

46:37

This was what i was asking didian for um because i thought they should be separate entries but it still works for the languages. Uh it's it's not too super boxes, it won't be but when you use if you go to the chat and you go to the languages drop down they will show up a separate entries there but i'm saying they're not.

46:55

I'm looking at the drop down in chat and there's showing up as one thing. Interesting. Did you put a space after the comma? Uh i i'm pretty sure i did. That's what i have and it's working for me so i don't know. Yep. Nope. Not working for me. I do not know.

47:26

Orgy, is just sitting there eating his stew, thinking about the really big fight. We were just staying in his cool sword that he just got and he goes i was carrying two, holy weapon bombs. That probably would have really helped during that fight.

47:45

No slowly turns. No sand drew slowly turns. This wasn't any paralyzed by a white? Yep. Yeah. Sandro throws. An empty bottle of something. He was drinking. I ochie from his career. I'm just saying i can make more of those if you need them. How are you using merithians? Sign language?

48:16

It's not in the polyglot, anywhere. It pulls from the list on my character sheet. I would imagine because that's the entries that i put in my languages section or what show up down here on the drop down on languages.

48:36

Why not have coyote selected, that's what's going on. So, i'll do this one more time for showcost, benefit, if i go to the attributes tab and i go to my languages and i click the edit button. I get the box that says actor ochi and it has all the checkboxes and then it has the special field at the bottom.

48:54

I put mincai in comma space, sends our comma space, etc. Varician sign. Language is one of those entries. If i hit update, actor puts all those on my character sheet and i go to the chat and in the languages, drop down in the chat. I have 10 languages to select from 12 languages to select from.

49:17

If i click on the varician sign language, one, i can say stuff with my hands.

49:28

A lot of you know, hideous laughter by any chance. Dude asking girlfriend. No, unfortunately not, uh, yeah, i just followed your instructions, like point for point and it didn't work. I'm just a special part. You have to change your race to tengo and then it will let you do it.

49:45

I'm sure i had to reload before they showed up. That could be a two. It could just be the actor, not updating. Also, you took the one language that i thought i might have over you because it's unique to kids in a starting out with an alternate racial tray.

50:02

Yeah, i know it's when you're talking about, yeah.

50:11

I think i tried to burn a lot of them on like, being able to talk to certain people in the party and then understanding more dialects because i think you know, that makes more sense for him picking up stuff, that's more native to the dragon empires. Because after a certain point after like, six ranks in linguistics, i think the the value starts to drop off diminishing the time.

50:39

Yeah, by by level 20 which you will speak every language that's ever been created.

50:50

And he's actually going to pull out his journal that i've never mentioned that he has and start writing down some more stuff. He's been keeping tabs online so far. So yeah. I reloaded the thing and mean cayenne and censor are still in their own box together. I don't think this journal is something that he shares with anybody, really?

51:11

But i want everyone to know that at the top of every single entry people. The language drop down is working now. Yep. At the top of every single entry in his journal. It says, koya has saved our lives again. Today, it seems after and there's like a tally mark at the top of every page, it's like Grayson legs fatalities that hasn't gone up in a long time.

51:46

I just started trying to catch up on the recaps because i did like two of them. After i did the original one, to get everybody caught up. And i have like there's like 13 and i was looking at when we fought the ooze before the tengu ambushed us and i think that might be the last time that you did it.

52:03

You did it actually. No, you did it. In the tower. No use an arrow to break out. That's right. I'm sorry. So yeah, maybe these fight i kind of want to to the big recap at the end of each book before we start the next. I think that would be a nice refresher.

52:24

Yeah i'm i'm it's tough with the the baby. Um but i am trying to catch up on them and i think i'm just going to spend the 20 bucks to publish it and then you guys can see it as a wiki in that way. Nobody has to go through all of the the nonsense that i had to do to do mine and it'll just be.

52:39

I want to do like some art for it, too, but that would take forever. I think we'll be done with the adventure before. I was planning to do like one per session or one per book, if that doesn't pan out. And i think i will be very far black if we stay on schedule.

52:58

But we could have that to pull from, i am trying to catch it up.

53:09

This i can in fact take 10 and double countries. Yay.

53:30

Okay, where did we make camp actually? Uh, we'll save probably either on or near the remnants of the dead man's. Uh, thank you. Yeah. And so no more waves came after us that was the tote the in total i was it you you fought off the rest of them?

53:52

Yes, yes, we did.

53:58

Cool. And now we're eating stew and talking about the cool juices that, no ice, skating up grace. And you don't want to be patient. Zero, do you? I could use a drink or for what a drink. Sure.

54:19

Let's call it Bob.

54:24

Shot shots. Shots shots. Hey everybody. Like i'm i could definitely use some good food after that. God, don't want this. I think you also succeed at like, what dc18? But DC, what for what 18 for poison if i'm just taking that. Oh, if i get a one um they could be.

54:59

I mean 14 right now. It was like a 25 percent chance. It might work, which is kind of whatever.

55:13

Cocoa is very weak to poison. Please do notice them. Don't worry. I would never do anything. So malicious as poison you, she says tipping in something into your drink, okay? All right, and you guys got the warrior terracotta teleson, right? Uh, we got two horse ones, you said it was horse.

55:32

And that's the one that we had previously, you should have gotten a horse and a warrior. We got horse the first time. I don't remember where from and you said horse, again, you should get a warrior from the dead man. Still, okay, my apologies. No, you're good. I just wanted to verify.

55:52

Where did we get the horse from? I don't remember. I think it was the dragon sword. Ah yeah, that sounds right.

56:06

I,

56:15

Into the decentral. Pretty sure i can. That horse seems really useful, if it does what you say, it does.

56:33

Yeah, it can move in an l-shape, but most other pieces can only move in the line.

56:43

That's amazing. Tell me more sensor. No, but seriously if this thing works as a phantom steed once the day and doesn't get used up. Does it get used up? I don't believe so. No, they're like magical figurines. I could be wrong though. I haven't actually played read them through.

57:05

Uh, what's it called? Air caught a figure. Yeah, there can. Yeah, i'm pretty sure. Um, i'm pretty sure they function as, um, What you call it figurine, figure into wondrous power. There we go, it could be wrong. But that feels like it would be the case.

58:16

Yep, once per day. So yeah, it is. We're coming.

58:26

Circle drums in his knee. It says.

58:32

So now that we're getting closer, what exactly is our plan here?

58:42

We know that there's a big storm in our way. Yeah, i really thought that we would have solved that problem and we took the tower, but it seems we're not through it yet.

58:57

I'm sorry, we we've still got storm bullshit today. With, i mean, the storms have faded some They're now passable. Oh, so they've just kind of returned to regular storms that were regular storms. Yeah, we would deal with for passing through at this time of year. Anyways, the the hosts or go fucker forgot what was called?

59:27

That was bound to the storm. Inspire was released from the storm spire and sped off.

59:37

And you might recall that you are aware. That the hungry storms are sapient in some way. I hate that but their storms. They're not creatures. They are a, a thinking and malice, filled force of nature fun. So is a micro first thing in the morning and you don't say make them blending about that.

01:00:15

Sorry, this fish please continue as you I'm a terrible person. He accidentally it's choko with whatever she tried to hit. No amigo tried to throw an orange at you and it slips out of her hand and hits Shoko. Yeah we'll go with that. Ah, what did i do? I'm sorry.

01:00:48

You only hates me for. I speak the truth. It says Noah clumping on top. One caravan here. You get any of the neck batch of curry? I make.

01:01:02

I'm so sorry. Your highness. Please forgive your unbeautiful. Immediately just goes full the gravel just like he's pretty fame for her curry. So shit dank says ochi it wins awards.

01:01:24

Yes, well, big fun. I'm so sorry. Uh, please accept my under apologies and

01:01:35

Also stopping a weirdo and sitting in the corner. I'm sit by the fire.

01:01:43

Not want much more weirdo delay. Who also tends to be off by herself is near the fire because she has nothing. Well actually the razor probably because we were about to get murdered by cold skeletons. The one fucking spell that she has on her character sheet is resist energy.

01:02:04

Where are shivering her favorite? Enemy is goblin noise. Which sure came in handy in this in the north. Yeah, i use fear and rise of the roomlords. She is a famed goblin slender but yeah that makes sense. Yeah, yeah. She fires her bow from waste height. Also sugar you should totally drink outfits, totally fine, don't worry about it.

01:02:38

Okay, i'll just looks to be staring off it into the distance thinking, don't worry, fine. Thinking what he's always thinking. We are definitely gonna die. It's okay though here. So drink up says, says, no, she puts a finger underage, just like, tips it up.

01:03:02

He looks side long at you and oh, cheers, i guess and and takes us. He smells it first. Ah, it's almost strangely of, like, some sort of pickle. Not, not like a sweet pickle, almost, like, the pickle plum wine that you've seen. Now, i kind of make artification.

01:03:33

Oh, this kills me. At least i don't have to deal with whatever's waiting for me past that god for second wall. Oh, he will. Oh yeah, he will tilt it back and drink it and then make a fort safe and fail.

01:03:53

You definitely do not. Um, so within one round all of a sudden Coco stocks is laughing like really, laughing like hideous laughter just laughing. But uncontrollable i was you get hit with decorations. He says as if is this strange grimace on his face halfway between and three and happy.

01:04:27

I don't think i've heard him laugh like that in 30 years. Oh, that must hurt so much actually oh it's fine.

01:04:44

What can i i don't think i should cast anything like this. Oh, this is oh no, you can. Oh it has this wonderful relaxant in it but uh i'm sorry. It's just weird seeing July, it makes things um, slightly difficult, it actually hurts my voice to laugh and show go voice.

01:05:10

So, i'm gonna not down. But yeah, no, no. It's just kind of their pad. You on the back just like, i'm glad to see that it works.

01:05:23

This is where off. If you're lucky one round for 26 rounds, So feel free to roll one v6 and find out how long you're going to be laughable or two consecutive safe.

01:05:44

I got you. Two rounds, so it doesn't matter. So have Yeah, like he's just going to town for like a solid 18 seconds. See everything i make is better. Uh, he just saying they're breathing heavily and on the floor and other hand on his forehead. Yeah. Yeah, sure there wasn't totally about suffocating me.

01:06:29

Don't exaggerate go poisons that will do that though. If you prefer or not, i'm joking. We couldn't you test that one on. Grayson was the last time because the one that Grayson's got will probably kill you. So grace and tips. No, no i haven't put that one in yet.

01:07:06

She says wrestling a small small mile. It's like i'm still looking on this one. Um ordinarily the onset time for for this particular baby takes a while but we're gonna see if we can shave off a little bit on it. So make it more palpable for you. I am currently endeavoring.

01:07:29

So that if i do test it on our good friend over there, he doesn't choke on his own tongue and die which i feel would be counted productive. So what i'm trying to achieve. Also, before i forget,

01:07:47

Just, No, it looks very uncomfortable for most like is press. What a individuals such as yourself, consider to be unathema to your goddess. Specifically. I don't know how Desmond's actually and treat you through their face.

01:08:17

Well.

01:08:22

Hmm, i've got us a dreams is very against removing anyone. Else's choice, causing fear or despair using nightmare magic or powers to corrupt dreams. We're really engaging any form of bigoted, racial, any behavior circle is scratch against the backs of his neck, trying to look away. Considering all the fear magic he's going to be not looking at you.

01:08:56

No, no, i just pops that's choke on the back of like me and you might have to talk later.

01:09:05

I see i i've had an idea. There was and i mentioned this really but there was a it was a young man that i used to used to hang around with who knew his way around botanicals much more than i ever did. Um, back particular recipe with what's her face with the evil demon worshiping bullshit.

01:09:32

Reminded me that there are ways that you can infuse certain types of liquids, to be able to channel magic again medication. Some of them are fairly innocuous and use the word harmless, but no, i have a place. Um, all right. But i did hear of one and i don't know exactly how important i doubt.

01:10:08

I'm gonna find the materials where i talk to you in the first place, but i might be able to find a way to make Poison that can make not several but inhibit. The problem is that i don't know how the bastard did it and i don't know. Exactly. It's all i know is that you can use that very specifically against followers of avadar.

01:10:43

So you can imagine that most of the contents for that one involved crumbling down bits of or durants and shoving that into a bottle along with a variety about it. For sure, i don't feel that would work on demons or such. So perhaps something like cooldown, um, the remnants of a whole velum or something like that.

01:11:11

Something that is fundamentally against their nature. As a practitioner of hateful arts, the reason i ask is because it's difficult for me to understand what developed person would consider to be cheap. White waves around, uh, hateful each other practices. Since my question, it doesn't always one of those posts that i don't fully comprehend but i suspect her chaotic nature probably has much in line with similarly chaotic entities purely academically speaking because i was handsome

01:12:08

For anybody wondering in nuts. No, i speak. She is trying to inventing heresy.

01:12:19

Which is a very specific poison. It seems like an awful lot of work to just you block jar. My dear. Well, here's the thing, not always failcasters require the use of their mouth for speaking. Of course, so it's not useful across the broad spectrum, but it seems like less of a headache.

01:12:49

Lockdown will stop you from casting. Muddling Harrison or stop you from chat line? Ah, A horrifying prospect. I cannot say that there's no would approve of you cutting off anyone from their deity.

01:13:11

No, i imagine. She wasn't. So if you're looking for absolution for a crime, you're going to commits in the eyes of my goddess, i can't really offer that you. Oh, no, no, not at all. I wasn't asking for it doesn't permission and i die. It does not really fun to giving permission.

01:13:31

Anyways, exactly.

01:13:37

More just from a perspective of what words come thing with someone new worships in the divine. I just so blessed in turn. What could i use?

01:13:55

You give me some ideas and food for thought, though. So,

01:14:02

I think since what you're talking about that's compound. It's from what i'm aware of. It's mostly used by followers of Of carry on some knowledge. Religion roles for that. Let's just assume we know stuff about art arts. Okay. You're a fart though. Yeah, that's fair. I i rolled in advance and i'm sorry, but please, yes, continue, yes, continue.

01:14:48

You can feel free to know what you want with that. For the most part, my logic is no way doesn't know where that particular poisoning comes from. She just knew somebody who's a black famous follow-up, though. Poison.

01:15:08

It's, it was invented by the arch devil of heresy and blessed me meant terrible. Disrupts people's faith in their own deities. That sounds about, right? That is truly evil. Did you say the archival blessed mess?

01:15:40

No way. If that poison comes from his followers, you shouldn't be making it. Like, the very act may be daming for your soul if that knowledge is heretical. Well, that's the thing. Oh, geez, eyebrows hit. What would be his hairline as he looks away? And at the ground i thought like no, i was like, no, no questions of glasses up.

01:16:04

Like that's the thing. I don't know exactly how it was made. I just know that the premise is. There it is. And it exists. So looking at the description for muddling heresy it doesn't like say evil anywhere on this like page, it comes to poisonous so i feel like it's all in the name muddling heresy, everything kind of just gets muddled.

01:16:43

And what it's worth it, it's probably around this time that you realize that nobody knows that she's talking about like a particular, kind of poison and such but the extenuous details of it. No, no idea. Don't don't. No, don't particularly gas. Why are you going to, you're going to jump this game chaotic for participating in violence?

01:17:03

Not because i'm pretty sure the job doesn't make me a follow-up and if you want to talk more specific access to using spells that can make, even to add fear things, but that kills more like another phone. Yes, you're not strong. Superstation sound showcostal

01:17:30

Imagine when i get to the bone yard for asthma, will have a few words from me? Yeah, they haven't made them shamble about him walk. I think she'd probably give you an air plus and tell you about on your merry way.

01:17:45

Also, i'm not passing judgment on you. My dear. I would just like to point out that if you need to explain so much moral gymnastics for something, the sound right, it may not be right in the end, just be careful. I do worry about your soul and where it will go.

01:18:03

I wouldn't i'm too concerned about the living right now, and the fact that we haven't died out here in the snow, peaks tells members, you know, this story is going to go enjoy very different directions or i am beyond fucked. Ah, i'm not entirely sure which one is here.

01:18:25

No way. Do you. Sorry. If this is a two personal question, you have a patron or matron data, someone you follow someone who's code. You believe in well, i did and then be killed all of her family, so no not really.

01:18:56

That's uh yeah. I can relate to that.

01:19:08

No just kind of shrugged right here. Until i know the princess tells me to get lost or one of you finding your soul to put me out of my measury at this function for the plants. I think i can be useful to you and if i'm not She just kind of shrunks.

01:19:34

Oh, My throat protests to say this but i do, i am thankful to have you here.

01:19:50

We wouldn't gotten nearly as far with it. Yeah. Hi.

01:19:58

Patio man, on the shoulder. Quite griffin was like, honestly, i I don't think that my particular part in your story is going to be very exciting and 100 years when they tell the story of how i makeo took the throne back from oppressive jade regent and started eyebrows. So beautiful note in there.

01:20:24

That mentions that yeah, that was one spiteful. Arrogant, little thing the top that she could get away with running away from what she was. And here, it comes down. To it. That'll be my place and i'm okay with that. I've made my peace with.

01:20:47

I mean after all, but the whole thing about ninja is that the more you know, about the the worst they are, right?

01:21:05

That's that's certainly something you, you know, okay.

01:21:12

Um, am i wrong here? You're not looking at literally, everybody just like, but come on circle looks at the drink in his hand.

01:21:31

Just because nobody knows much about something doesn't mean it ain't worth anything.

01:21:42

My worth is what i think it is.

01:21:50

Then of course whatever the rest of you want to attribute to it i suppose but good and they've worse comes the worst. It's my partner story is so small that people will notice it. I think it's best of all that. I'm no one who gets my hands. Dirty with things like this.

01:22:15

Proud and tell us though, all of you may be and noble to some and significant uh degree. No way, take a puffiness before you continue.

01:22:35

Join me in some zen. Why don't you?

01:22:41

What's wrong with just letting moves and bends for once? Honestly, but nonetheless does exactly. She's told and shuts up. You're still learning kid pictures of some slack.

01:23:02

Way. And just sort of sits on the ground in front of you and pass. This is the pipe back.

01:23:12

Well, thanks mr. Noflukong. But what you call me?

01:23:22

You're implying that you're not akin to the monkey king, lazy layabout.

01:23:35

Now, you've got some strongly about mythological individuals. Don't go just so go. Coughs of that like oh i'm sorry. I think there's a little bit left of that poison ivy. Some of us have actual jobs. This likes to wander the material plane pick and fights with people. He definitely don't know anybody who wanders around half the world pick and fights with random storms or anything like that.

01:24:08

Do we folks?

01:24:15

I don't think there's a

01:24:23

I mean, it's more like, they're in our way and we kind of, but we can't just go around them. They're too big. We've got, we got a scheduled to keep

01:24:42

Let's go to the crown. It's okay. I will shut up for the rest of this book now, but you're fine.

01:24:55

No, that was really good. I i like that. Well.

01:25:04

Where the map of the crown. Go one dose of the Japanese and those of that which is that much? Okay. So,

01:25:20

Was it worth 200 gold for a joke? Absolutely. I got choking a lot. It was worth every time.

01:25:30

And oh,

01:25:40

All right, within a couple of days you have found once more of the path of agony, we're not lost. Holy fuck. I mean well, well done.

01:25:59

If we stay on this, we should reach ola going. I'm going within a week.

01:26:08

It is not a large village, but we will be able to resupply there and perhaps gets really warm again. That is if whatever's following us, doesn't kill us first. Uh, we should make checks on that. What was was a caution's new form. She just a ghost he just looked ephemeral, man.

01:26:33

She just appeared for a few seconds in flashes of lightning in the storm. Wait, the bitch is back. What? Oh, yeah, yeah. While we were fight while we were fighting. Um, yeah, she would just like appear and then laugh at us and then disappear while you're fighting the skeletons.

01:26:56

What she become like a another one of those. What do they call it that? The yukiyona. Oh no. No, no, the storms after and pulled it her into it. I yeah, actually it kind of. Did you saw it? Rip her solo.

01:27:20

I mean, i saw her body that evaporated. Oh no, air ripped your soul out. I remember describing that you did, but no noise, don't remember? Yeah, she she's not no magic. What never mind, i retract. What i said.

01:27:45

But before we get to the village, we have two tiles to get through. Yeah, profound and you are down dragon. Ravaged caravan. Oh yeah, i think this is the last uh, like panel we get of like the, the plus 40 to it. Uh, no. Actually, once you're past deadman's, you are going into the high ice now.

01:28:16

So you're no longer in the expands, it's plus 90 this time.

01:28:31

Ah, and actually your first encounter after putting the rest, the uh, samurai is a wondrous polar aurora. That ripples overhead, that knee thing. And last for an entire week, this good omen grants, the caravan a plus, two bonus on resolve checks for the duration of the aurora and the caravan's fortune teller and use her reroll ability, one additional time that week, we're not doing the caravan encounters, but you're basically have a very lucky week.

01:29:05

Oh yeah. Oh, all right, right. We have a fortune teller. I'm just like holds up her arrow deck, empathy and pilgrim. Yeah, okay, okay. All right. Seems rather rude that the narrator didn't address you by name Google says, out loud in universe. And so 39 is a fucking dragon sighting again, but the dragon is dead.

01:29:40

So where we rolling that. Are you sure about that? Uh, i am positive about that.

01:29:51

Boo, boo.

01:29:57

Pleasant weather.

01:30:05

38 is the dragon sighting, again, i'm gonna reroll that

01:30:14

66. It's dragons all the way down people. Just this is the dragon book. The caravans provision somehow, become tainted, spreading sickness rapidly in the caravan. Oh, this one again. Yes. I through vigorous use. Once more of purifying food and drink and remove disease, you guys were able to fight it off after a day.

01:30:46

What do you discover it?

01:30:50

Two 51. Hey, look an aurora again. The light bulb. So, your trip across the high ice is actually fairly uneventful, except for, you know, some scurvy. So i gotta say um now that we're all the way across the expanse and so we're not going to be seeing like the really high results anymore.

01:31:16

A tables kind of disappointing. It was real scary for the first half of the travel. That wasn't it? Yeah but it's just yeah that was dragging. Attacks are gone. Yeah. It's it's a little disappointing, but we never got, i'll wait, did we we did the bullets? Yeah, yeah, let's see.

01:31:43

Uh, if you get it, if you get the depth from below in the high ice, it's a remoras and if you get it in the boreal experience, the young crossword.

01:31:56

Uh, we didn't get it, neither of those are areas.

01:32:04

There are a few, you haven't gotten still To do, haven't gotten the polar put in oh no not another slime. Not again. There are slimes in everybody. You cannot avoid them. He's returned. He followed us all the way from california for the bridge. Not this shit again. All right, let me get back down to the town.

01:32:39

So all and gordon is a village of roughly 626 people ruled over by an autocracy. Uh, it has the prosperous quality and the rumor mongering citizens quality.

01:33:04

The village is perched on the shores of the salt sea lake.

01:33:15

And here are a sets.

01:33:21

Boom, where it was the day of region. Yeah.

01:33:32

So we can do some quick bookkeeping now and take our break. We'll start again at four. I really get a peak.

01:33:49

I am. I used significantly by the plus one key focus and charcoal.

01:34:33

Are y'all, we need to, we need to be talking more. Honestly like, uh, like, like that scene. We just had there. I wish i. I wish i had more to say in response, uh, but it's just been like this has been such a combat heavy. Ap also. Are, is anyone else getting an echo for me?

01:34:53

Yes. A little bit. Yeah, i thought so um well i mean i don't know what's on the other side of the wall but i assume that we're going to be running into more like intrigue and social situations once we're in being chiroper. I would suspect the moment that we hitting in high.

01:35:16

Yeah.

01:35:21

Don't exactly what i'm announce yourself in a country. That is almost certainly going to be mobilized, tequila to kill you one site.

01:35:48

Uh, so what did we get from our to encounters on these vans, like added to the loot list? Crying crying things about right?

01:36:05

Oh yeah. We got the, uh, the cube of frost resistance and the gem of brightness, was that what was also in that room?

01:36:27

Haven't actually read the jump. Brightness for Johnny.

01:36:44

What is base value mean? For a settlement base value is the amount. So if you, you can buy any item up to that price like they will have it. Gotcha. So that's these are strange names for this. I'm reading up on how this works because the prosper is bumps everything up a little bit but i was immediately upon reading it.

01:37:06

I was like oh the purchase limit is like the biggest thing you can buy but that makes sense. Base value is the biggest thing you can buy. Purchase limit is the total amount of goods that you could purchase. Nope. Nope, so base value is the, i mean, the ends when it definitely, but rules has been face, value is like, you can find anything up to that that price with information beauty and basically between 650 and 3750 dt.

01:37:36

There is a 50 percent chance that you will be able to find the item that you are looking for. Got you, i want you to find for example, of natural llama to grand, like, you roll, 50% chance, they have it 50 times. They don't, there is nothing above 3750 or something items that you see below.

01:37:55

Gotcha. And then the purchase limit is what they can buy, okay.

01:38:07

So uh you can't melt down the cube into into a few thousand goals that that is not going to be an option in this particular location, but imagine it will want to across the the welcome. I have a blue question for you guys. Actually, uh, we have that magical music box from the silver dragon.

01:38:32

It claimed, it was one use and i think he said after it was used we were welcome to sell. It does anybody have a reason to want to keep it or good for me to market as for for sale? I think we should be fine to sell it. I think we should be but i think you should ask sans first if the value was changed or not, i'm pretty sure it's worth less.

01:38:57

Now that the spell isn't that? Yeah, i think it might just be the worst of the box itself as foreground like it's exclusively made dark, wood positive lines or something.

01:39:24

Which here in the staff, do any of us? Want the staff, the staff of journeys. I believe that's currently inquisense.

01:39:39

And make the most valuable thing. We're carrying we can't sell it here. Anyways, i don't think.

01:39:51

Yeah i just yeah i don't think any of us actually used the thing and at any point uh what are the rules on using a staff? Like you, do you need to make a usd check for it if it's not if it has spells that are not on your list, then?

01:40:09

Yes. Um the way that it works is that the staff has a certain number of charges and you will need to charge it up. Do what you do that is that if you have a style on your list that you're taking your testing of corresponds to one of those on staff, uh then you can't expand themselves.

01:40:33

Lots of that spell in order to charge the staff for equal number charges spell level objective. So if it had haste on it, for example, you could cast a haste to spell into it and it would get three charges back, but i have to know the spell can't just be on my list.

01:40:56

I believe, i will have to chat. Um, that's the charge it though. Like you would need to know the spelling order to charge it to use it. I don't actually know it has been a while, i'm taking a look.

01:41:16

This one's got detect snares and pits and developments long strider passed without trace and freedom movement. I remember talking i'm being like, oh, this seems like every major state value from the divine works, right?

01:41:47

Something about phases that they use the ability schools just like the DCs of this bells from the user. So they don't use minimum but also use the cast as caster level. But after that, in the power of the staff, that's high in the castle of stuff.

01:42:06

Um, Potential background chargers each broadcasting, the staff consumes you one or more charges when i stop and get the charges. It cannot be used until it is recharged. Each morning. One is called after prepare spells or against falsehood. You can also en view one started your powers, only one or more of the spells cast by the staff is on their spell list and you are capable of casting, at least one of the spells.

01:42:32

So you would have to have it on your known most of your companions during this stuff with his power restoring one charge to the staff. But the castle mustard that i want to tell or spells what? Level equal to the highest level spell cast by the staff. For example and i'm from wizard with a stack of fire, could induce a staff with one charge per day by using up.

01:42:52

One of his fourth, level spells, a stack, can update more than one child per day, and i can't, i can do more than one step. I forgot how much.

01:43:14

That's not to say that having a stick or freedom of movement is an absolutely dagger.

01:43:44

Five pre-casts of freedom of movement. Are they charges? One job today, i must adhere

01:44:39

Level one one. Just a 750, right?

01:44:45

I think i'm pick up the wand up there then.

01:44:51

Uh, one of no one was a boy for you.

01:45:10

Amers are.

01:45:17

Uh, circle will purchase that wand of fairy fire.

01:45:30

Very well, the menu purchases it from is they fairly gruff older looking dwarf.

01:45:45

Don't suppose, there have been many else others through here recently. No, it's the off season. Abby, which folder did you get the links? I charm out of previously, i looked in like items magic items and wondrous and i wasn't finding it. I didn't, he created. It makes you wonder why you folk around here.

01:46:15

Oh, you're the reason the storms to be moving again. Uh, were sightseeing.

01:46:30

Yep. Heard me kyle was lovely this time of year. Speaking of which any news from past the wall, i that the storms is moving again.

01:46:56

Now, do you mean which storms do you mean thumbs all over the north?

01:47:11

Yeah.

01:47:15

Is it a good thing that they're moving or a bad thing?

01:47:22

Moving storms, good for the ones. It's already boots fast but still more trouble for the ones that's heading towards.

01:47:42

Anything else? Weird happen around here recently.

01:47:49

Maybe just looks at your caravan. Uh yeah, i guess.

01:47:59

Hello, i won't keep you any longer.

01:48:07

Oh and by the way, when you arrived at town stagni kind of just fucked off. Oh yeah. Yeah, he literally just leaves believing his contract with you and payment now with it.

01:48:31

Um we did come up with one loot related question. The silver dragon had given us a that magical music box that summoned him, but it was like a one-time use is previously told us it was worth 4000 gold and that we could sell it after. It was used how i was going to check to see did that price change after its magic had been used?

01:48:52

That was the price after the magic was gone, the four thousand gold. I'm going to go use the restroom real quick. Uh, sans, i don't know how to make wand, uh, you just drag the spell onto your inventory, sheets, and you will get the option to make it a post from the ones, or scroll or spell, as long as you're on your inventory tab.

01:49:28

All right, i'll be right back.

01:50:07

Pick out 3750 worth of stuff to sell to get off our loot sheet to that we start the process of selling some of this stuff. But just letting you know, what? I'm gonna do that. All right.

01:50:36

And this is one way to keep a party's item level at a specific level. Yeah, never have villages. Freaking solve your big ticket items. At, here's some stuff that's worth. Uh like just shy and like 70 grand. Don't expect to do anything with it.

01:51:02

That's pretty much this book. Yeah, here you go deal with a punk.

01:51:42

Okay. Got that done. I'm all set.

01:52:15

Was that everyone else at? I'm pretty sad. Um, can i trouble you to roll me to 50% chances? Yeah, i've potions box back. Sure. Yeah, i don't know. Hi bad load. Good.

01:52:46

Nope.

01:53:06

All right, so everyone's been there they're buying and selling i believe so because i am saving my gold for my first head back and i'll never get this. Grayson can build them.

01:53:35

Um, jug if you're looking for intelligent. So we have one in the loot list. I did wonder what skill was associated with that but now charisma, either of the other two, i'm not joking. Either one is perfectly fine.

01:54:02

The ran around here.

01:54:11

Really wish these masks were closer together.

01:54:21

You take the south of all and corn, the caravan was traversed, the 20 mile long vorkier pass which rises above 5000 feet,

01:54:40

If the caravan has been out of the high ice for more than two months, they have lost their, wow. Okay. I don't know how you would have been out of the hype. I guess you could wait.

01:54:57

Hold on. Have you been out of the highest for two months? Three six nine. Well my group 14, 18, 21 24? No, no, you were out for about a month. Your acclimation remains.

01:55:24

Ascending the paths, the caravan must negotiate. The geothermically active veils of baroon's breath once. Atop the past. The caravan passed, then passes through the ice sheath, the monkey forest known as the word of winters. Deadly roar or was just narrating this as you pass through these places.

01:55:53

All right, i'm back very fasting.

01:56:00

One.

01:56:18

And while you are stopped in camps in this frozen forest one night and we moved on from the village. Did you not get anything anything by yet? Oh no. I bought what i bought? What i wanted. I just then hear you, i just got here so oh, welcome back.

01:56:43

Wait, let's see. South of all ungorn. The caravan must traverse. The 20 mile long award tier pass which rises above 5000 feet. Boom ascending the past, the caravan, then negotiates the geothermically active veils of baroons breath uh if we know that this thing is five thousand. Um, how big is the bridge across?

01:57:16

Uh, because that that might convince me that maybe we should pick up that.

01:57:25

Oh wait, no never mind. We keep. It's in our loot list. Uh who has the the ring of featherful.

01:57:39

Definitely didn't really have them. We do have one. Um, well, i mean, i'll make those the vip so i say on the ocean have the ring on if she doesn't already have both rings slots taken up.

01:58:09

Just in case.

01:58:16

Is everyone there? Yep. Yeah.

01:58:23

I am just setting you guys up on the bridge.

01:58:33

Uh, if one of us falls, what when the the words you're looking for their shoku is go on. How do we get down very carefully?

01:58:53

No pass down, huh? Actually struck those. I perks up and he says, if we want to risk it for fame and glory, i wouldn't be surprised if uh, well, a lot of things have fallen down there over the years.

01:59:21

I'd be something valuable down there.

01:59:32

I mean, apparently there was fucking diamonds or something under a sway that toxica toxic ass fucking slush. So who knows what the the writers were thinking? But i'm not forget that the cybermen had like, oh, yeah, the fucking jewelry. It ended down like how, why would they expect the players to just go diving into this sledge?

02:00:08

Don't worry. It's it's just it's just like i'm an immense amount of neurotox. Don't worries, deadly neurotoxin. It's fine. Pony told me that.

02:00:35

That was gonna throw on detect magic because this is a space that we would have to cross. So they if someone's expecting us and doesn't want us to cross it then,

02:00:58

Tech magic would detect like magical traps, right? If you are staring long enough into that space. Yeah, you're just casually walking maybe not. All right. What about walking like slowly as long as you're focused on the direction for that amount of time? Yeah, you'll you'll be fine. You do not detect any magic.

02:01:27

He's been idiot. Go do the mental thing from scout and tell you that there's nothing there. And then have five encounters trigger all walls.

02:01:39

That's fine. Sounds like a good idea, doesn't? It says no way and just here's the thing. Wait, no, this is this is a place where i can gather information. Uh, shoko looks around. Are there any birds in the sky? I'm sorry.

02:02:00

I'm so glad you kept that stuff. I'm so guys, the yako. Go ahead. They're they're birds, all right.

02:02:16

Uh,

02:02:25

Um,

02:02:29

I would ask if any, uh, if any great predators or monsters, watch this bridge or nearby right now.

02:02:45

Well, i haven't seen anyone lately mind you, but there is this really scary red skin, dude, that comes out and attacks people on the bridge that i don't know. Man, i've seen him talking to the air.

02:03:06

Finish. Do you share that with us? Yeah, poisoned horns. Lots of white hair. Big sword.

02:03:16

Uh, so apparently there's a red guy. White hair. Big sword attacks people on the bridge sometimes. Oh yeah, that's an awful lot. Like an ogre mage tube shogo. I was i was literally about to have to have no idea. Feel like, oh, potentially has a face that looks remarkably.

02:03:34

Like pulls out Kevin dotsu's. Sculpt this thing. Oh hey. That looks just like it. The birds say that looks just like it, okay? Okay, okay, please put that away immediately draws. My fuck is actually okay.

02:03:59

So what kind of spells does do over magia? I have again i yes a prefer pressure course. Is i know you guys scored. Well last time they have spell like abilities including at will darkness and invisibility they constantly have fly-on and once per day they can charm monster coat of cold guess is form or deep slumber.

02:04:26

All those are bad. I'm just going to put away my knowledge planes role. Oh yeah. No you guys, you guys. This is very well on this last time, i was like recall. Yeah uh regeneration five suppressed by fire acid like, you know, a troll for some reason.

02:04:49

Well, they're in the like but they share that mythology space. Yeah, that's true.

02:05:00

Uh they are native outsiders shape changers.

02:05:16

And despite their size quite graceful, they have things, including combat, expertise, and combat, reflexes, and improve initiative.

02:05:28

They're very fast. Um i'm suddenly very angry that i i rolled to not find more portions, something very mad about that.

02:05:50

Well.

02:05:55

That goes gonna start us off with some buffs over back here on the side of the bridge where the this thing can't knock us off. Oh, she's gonna take out, uh, his katana that he got and also a holy weapon bomb.

02:06:20

And he's gonna apply the holy weapon, bomb to the katana.

02:06:27

Everyone else. May perform one action. As you were getting a surprise round reasonable gas, perks get on himself.

02:07:02

All right, everyone gets good. Hope that's just so we know that i used it. That's not throwing it.

02:07:20

Remember to get it on you before you roll will initiative it. Uh, oh, it doesn't affect an issue. Good hope.

02:07:35

Okay, listen, i think so. It's been a while since. I'm sure it is. I rolled away ends initiative. I forgot. I had control of them.

02:07:52

He said good hope right. I did not apply it before. I did the initiative role.

02:08:12

So everyone who forgot. Yeah, that you're an initiative is too hotter.

02:08:25

We spell instills a powerful hope on the subject each affected creature gets plus two morale. Saving throws attack rules ability, checks skill, checks and weapon damage roles.

02:08:39

So, the initiative is a skill check. Like happy says, right, there's no initiative skill. It's an ability, neither is a concentration check, but a concentration, check is a skill. Check. It's, it's one of those things that never comes up.

02:09:03

Uh, unfortunately i don't think the plus two matters for any of you actually. Can't paiso just figure out how these different thousands of different combinations of feets and abilities interact and just clarify all them for us. My goodness, they did they called it second edition. They said less man.

02:09:22

All right, i think about that a lot. It's like going from oblivion to skyrim or borrow into oblivion. All right. Did everyone get their action? I applied my bomb. That's what i was trying to do if you want to rule. Like i don't have quick draw so this could be like two turns worth of stuff, but as soon as there was mention of Oni, he was drawn his sword out and then he has to draw out the weapon ball.

02:09:51

And then he has to apply the weapon ball. If you want to stop me at any point during those and decide that i have to use part of my next turn to do some of that i would totally understand

02:10:07

Not be here right now. It's good, it's good. And we're you're okay. Okay, she's just doing the up with the different chat.

02:10:26

He's doing the piece.

02:10:31

Just OG went after we hit the knowledge. Check. Shame sprinkling bomb sword. Yeah.

02:11:00

Very good time.

02:11:12

And shoko.

02:11:20

Soco will.

02:11:26

Uh, use a move action to start playing a brand new performance, but none of you have heard before. They don't actually have it in bus because i haven't used it before but shoko starts playing a counter song.

02:11:47

Because i'm not sitting there and watching no way, get charmed again.

02:11:55

Samsung just stop. Stop charm. Right. Right. So i it. Yeah, it works and charm person being not language dependent. I'm pretty sure charm monster is not.

02:12:24

I'm very awkward about it. I literally can't. Remember that is affected by a sonic or language dependent magical attack verbal for mass. Nothing for charm monster.

02:12:38

So nope, it's just mind if i think it just works because it's not restricted by creature type. So it's got to be able to bypass language barrier.

02:12:50

Or it wouldn't work automatically on things like animals.

02:12:58

Oh crap. I forgot to put koias thing down. Then inspire courage. Instead charm person says, you must speak. The person's language to communicate your commands or else be good. At pantoming. Come personals. Okay. HR monsters. Oh, different beast. So that's my move action. And from my regular action, i will be clicking the cube.

02:13:28

The, the thing that gives us a protection against frost that we got from the storm tower. So, okay, where is that? That's um, a few of the frost or something like that. Yeah, it's cheaper people processes. Yeah. Okay.

02:13:57

Okay. So beacon of luck, you know, as an immediate action before saving throw is made allies within the area, can choose to benefit from this luck rolling twice for a saving throw and taking the better result. Once the creature benefits from the beginning of luck. In this way, it cannot gain the benefit of this bill for 24 hours, all saves, and all of you get to roll twice once of your juicing.

02:14:55

We see that you are not so easily taken by surprise. Give to us. The he may and the rest of you may leave.

02:15:16

Discord shop.

02:15:28

I mean,

02:15:35

Yeah, pretty much. Um,

02:15:41

Yeah, i know and it just um,

02:15:50

Uh, no response. Well, i don't think we need to respond to these guys. No, no, we're good.

02:16:05

So can we triangulate their reposition from their voice? I don't know. Anyone gosh, that could have a profession creepy gracing does actually You are five thousand feet up though. In a windy gorge.

02:16:30

Yep.

02:16:34

Yeah. So oh okay, so 46 doesn't do it.

02:16:47

Breathing. It came from over here somewhere. Get some turns into his head in that direction and is like peering over there and listening but you know it's too big to get a exact, you know, square position. So he's just kind of keeping an eye in the area. You have to understand that he rolled the 46, but with all the negatives from wind distance, that's actually something around the 25.

02:17:23

Which is still pretty good for audio. It is still is still pretty good. Yeah you want a direction which was? Yeah yeah. So yeah. Pinpointing something by sounds ordinarily difficult.

02:17:44

Boom.

02:17:48

So that was coyote turn.

02:17:58

Need you not mean to comply.

02:18:10

Uh so this frost cube it says i get a 10 foot cube on each side uh centered on me. So definitely like centered on one corner that i choose. That means centered on you. So does that mean it only encompasses me? No, it's kind of put cubes.

02:18:43

Okay. But isn't that 15 foot on inside, though?

02:18:53

Yeah, the human processes. It does not say like 10 foot radius. It says 10 feet on a side, centered on the possessor.

02:19:11

And it's cube in your inventory. Uh well it's in the the group loot. But yeah, i was the one who used it in the last fight so i guess which i wasn't questioning if you had it or not. I want to read it. I don't think i'm understanding.

02:19:40

Why did i click the items? Compendium could have just used a website. They're announcing my inventory.

02:20:01

All right, the key was activated or do you have the pressing one side? Wouldn't activated. It creates a cube shaped area, 10 feet, on a side, centered on the possessor, or on the cube itself.

02:20:27

And create another sides. So so it's not like like we designate a corner and then that corner is the center.

02:20:42

There's usually how that goes.

02:20:51

He's the right thing tool and feet on the side. All right, put it one down. She'll go over like hold it. A little behind them to catch koya and Annika on it.

02:21:10

Like this. Yeah. I like that. Excellent.

02:21:16

Boom. Boom, that also catches no way in it.

02:21:25

You don't see it but you feel like there's approval somehow excellence.

02:22:00

Is it an action to use the two rules? Uh, it's an immediate action. I'm not that again. I'm not gonna look at my reflex saviors. I'm just going to roll it, i don't think on they going to make reflexes like it just nullifies the damage for them.

02:22:26

It could be quite funny because i think the cube might actually explode from this. It'll definitely collapse but i want to explode. It's a of 50 damage in a turn, means it collapses and cannot be reactivated for an hour. It's 100 points of cold damage in a 10 round period.

02:22:45

At the piva's destroyed. I repeat myself. I'm pretty sure the cube's gonna explode. Oh,

02:23:01

Uh, it might not actually it only took 38 points in the image. Probably go 38. That is surprisingly. Okay, and the other yoga mage actually gave up his certain waiting for you guys to surrender or health section held detection. That's the proper order of business. So yes, it might actually collapse right here.

02:23:31

Now, you see him?

02:23:36

So i'm going to take half, right? Uh, if you made the say yes, and that is correct, no evasion for you yet. I don't ever get evasion the way i'm building. Sadly, which is wild because og's entire thing is that he's very fast

02:24:01

One.

02:24:05

All right. Anyway, yeah. Put away enroll way enrolled being in his master's face. He is familiar kind of sees happening and then just leaps clings to the side of her head.

02:24:33

Okay, so it pops but the cube is not destroyed.

02:24:42

How's a 19? Do that passes.

02:24:49

An 18 mitovite. Okay, you scared me there for a second. That is rough. I keep forgetting that you're not actually like a member. Okay. Oh, she's just pretending just realized gonna cold is a a reflexive

02:25:21

Okay, i thought all cold spells were before so they have Atwell Lesser invisibility. Uh, no, they event will invisibility just not greater. Yeah. Okay. I see, um,

02:25:43

Ochi as a move action is going to or use. Oh yeah, here we go. Sorry, this is not it's not an action at all, that's how we've decided. He's wait. What am i doing? Okay, standard action. He's gonna crush his link side charm.

02:26:05

Did i take that off? I'm sorry. I'm so not doing great today. Where is it? Well i have clicked it. Yes he's gonna crush the link side charm. How do i link it in chat because it's not going to use button. I know we know what it does but just so you remember anybody uh if you want to leak into chat just click the 20.

02:26:30

Yeah, this could be ion. Ah, that's right. So, their standard and then forward, move action, going to bar room for all her. There's that.

02:26:51

My one for the day to gain a feet, which i will tell you about when it's time to use it. And then swift action. It's going to challenge the one on the left.

02:27:07

Where's my challenge button?

02:27:15

That is OG's turn.

02:27:28

All right.

02:27:34

Nothing.

02:27:43

And it might evil and draw her weapon.

02:27:56

I'm a bad idea.

02:28:03

She well, i guess this is why we gave her the ring. No.

02:28:14

Look at the princess is gonna end up fall into our death. She might as well go down with a plum. The only have only tried to capture her. So far though they had ample opportunity to kill her. That is true. So uh everybody stand around a mako and then they won't drew it, us off the edge of the bridge.

02:28:35

Which is why i know who's going to use your sandwich already an action just in case anybody gets in swapping distance.

02:28:46

I doubt it will happen, though.

02:28:54

It just gave me the next up for weight, hands initiative, because

02:29:06

Took a five foot zip and full attacking the only on the record.

02:29:17

Fit, you've got all that acid damage.

02:29:26

Not. Damn. Yeah, he drops and both to his death. He'll go.

02:29:44

What's the range on fairy fire? It doesn't show it like what? I just click on the item.

02:29:53

I guess i have to, i, i have a, i have a standard animal action. So i can just however, far is, i can just move up to overuse up. Uh,

02:30:16

Uh, where is very far? Uh,

02:30:24

You used it? Yep. Oh it's all. It's a long run show? Yeah, yeah. I get a no problem.

02:30:38

And uh shoko shokos stays where he is in fact shuffle my foot soaks back.

02:30:52

No save no nothing. Okay.

02:31:00

Oh yeah, holds up for star knife. Kind of looks like. She's testing the distance like.

02:31:13

I feel to hit him.

02:31:27

Being him noise.

02:31:33

Boom, and then restart a nice flies back to her.

02:31:40

So this man who suddenly fears for his existence uh in many many ways does not want to die and there's only here to capture amigo. So uh no way. No idea. You're there. None whatsoever. You know, that that seems appropriate.

02:32:14

That is not the role i wanted to use but okay again. Oh, because it is books, like boundary

02:32:27

Uh, so to start off, that should be too higher who you hit. That is the very wrong damage. I'm assuming. So i'm going to fix that. So, please just use the damage off of this.

02:32:49

And that has the only vein in there, already. It does max and fencing strike. Fantastic. So your second. And then after that applies, please make me a 42% that. I'm sure you will automatically pass.

02:33:17

Yeah, they wait. Yeah, it's still 22. Let me delete that.

02:33:36

Wahoo.

02:33:42

Uh so seconds. This ogre mage appears uh well no way up years after gutting, this ogre mage

02:34:01

Uh who screams in fury and blood rage and then what are you gonna do about it? And nothing. He's going to miss with both of his attacks. Boom. Boom. Okay. Oh, you're gonna og, he's going to zoom around him not using acrobatics to avoid attacks of opportunity to get behind him.

02:34:34

Zoom, he's gonna be there. If you would like to swing at me, please do so he would he misses? He misses badly, he misses badly. The second is doing work right now. Yeah, it is. So we're gonna try and faint against him and fail.

02:35:03

That'll do it. I mean it was entirely doable too. These guys are not dragons and then he's going to swing at him. Wielding his fancy new. Super cool guy. Katana with two hands. You guys remember? When ogre majors could one round you and they were terrifying. I mean, those, yeah, those two prosper.

02:35:32

Uh, frost cones would have what a fucked us up with does that ever even hit? All right, uh it does hit actually because he's sickened there's an additional 2d 4. Is that the little triangle one? Those are deforce. Oh yes. Yeah, the triangles are too but i do believe that's the extra.

02:35:55

Holy damage from the bomb just for pizzazz. Yeah. You, you decapitate the owning mage. Uh, you got him to negative 23, which is this constitution. Exactly. So ochi who has been trying so hard to be this beautiful graceful warrior this whole time. Uh, i assume now since they've been inspired and gotten this katana has actually finally succeeded at what team imagined himself.

02:36:29

Becoming yeah, definitely.

02:36:47

All right, hopefully there's not more of them. She'll end this performance. You reckon i can make a second honey on this one.

02:37:06

Um,

02:37:11

I mean, if you want to

02:37:16

I don't know why anyone wants to wear only on their face.

02:37:24

I can't say, i understand if myself but i did believe it's actually a thing of what what do you call them? Would we maybe have this talk on the other side of the bridge?

02:37:41

Well, you don't like hearts.

02:37:46

So go very gingerly shoko. Very gentrally steps around. Omega. Okay, you you live a very fearful life, don't you? I'm sorry. Did you just assume that omeco? Wouldn't fake shove? You. The chaotic. Well, she's not really chaotic good anymore. Is she still? Looks like she thinks about about it but then realizes that she's on the path to maturing and doesn't it's okay.

02:38:20

She actually takes your elbow and helps helps you.

02:38:26

10 years ago, she totally would have shoved you.

02:38:33

He's grown up. What are those things called when you was? But,

02:38:45

I forget what they're called, but it says no, she like looks like this christening decapitated only skull. It's like i'm sure there's a oh you mean a kabuki mask?

02:39:03

Is that what it? What it is. It's the the theater arts or something, right? Yeah. Some of that shit's scary.

02:39:17

I'm familiar with some of the entities. Um, the only one that i ever really picked up was the higher. Okay. Mother obvious raisins. You know, when we get into minkai proper, there's a priest of sukiyomi. I want to introduce you to

02:39:43

Genuine, like i think you might do good in with the moon. God mind you. He's also the god of madness and insanity, but you know, curing those things. Oh, you gotta just scampers off. Worried about stupid. Sukio studio? Yes. Did i say six yummy? You sure did because that's who he it is.

02:40:14

It's fine. Yeah, it's not suki on there, huh? Yeah, apologies. I mean they even made him a jade rabbit. Come on. Yeah, well it's not that he's super yummy. Mixed with is a naughty for some extent. Also, a bit of chunky. Yes, with the whole jade hair thing here.

02:40:36

I was about to bust out flurry of stars for the first time and Grayson just obliterates. The other one, the greatest threats and inkai right now is not, in fact, the only it's probably a drunk grace and firing in the wrong direction. I mean you you say that but i really didn't do anything and to help with the dragon, both of them.

02:41:01

Actually you guys are they're able to hold your own these days. Circle squints his eyes at the bridge. Um, say christian. Do you are do you think this thing can can hold the weight of the caravan me coal?

02:41:28

Background is just quiet doing. Nope, they're not too big, idiot. I don't know. I got no idea. I don't know anything about architecture or engineering.

02:41:49

Do i know anything? Oh, do i think the virtual hold? Can i roll profession? Caravan guard on getting a caravan over a bridge.

02:42:02

I mean, yeah, you guys can do all of these things, but koi has had to make hole on your spell list, since you brought her a broken key to repair. Okay. My reiterate again that i love coyote. Yeah, ochi says it'll definitely hold up after koya. Fixes the bridge pretty much.

02:42:20

I guess that will it. Hold up after coin of things. Yes. Quite. So this was the bridge isn't even supposed to be like a danger. It's the only letter the danger. Yeah. But oh, she's literally like guarding. A caravan crossed a bridge once and is like, this isn't my first rodeo it'll be fine.

02:42:42

I'm so glad he has a professional monkey with us. Okay, just wait until we get on a boat sitting at the head wagon. Like uh-huh has literally done all of the caravan responsibility.

02:43:06

Once atop the past, the caravan, then passes through the ice sheast dolma, golkey forest known as the wood of winter's deadly roar, that's lovely.

02:43:21

One of these days we're coming to our location that's just known for its perilously. Good hot springs. And excellent cheese. I was literally just thinking like we're gonna roll up on, like the super dope, sauna. One of these days, you know? Yeah. It was like, please tell me that oncens are real.

02:43:36

Ah, i mean this, this is the weed campaign. There has to be a whole story. If they will be, please tell me the own sins were real.

02:43:49

The poo poo. This is the next day so you guys can reset your buffs. And all of that good. Because i burned my one bar room brawler over that fight. And no, i would absolutely talk all the way under. He's just like wait you actually know about like the moon gods.

02:44:07

Like come on talking. I am a devout follower of shizuru. Of course, i know about her husband and lover that never gets to meet her and his jealous fucked. Hard of a brother. You know, you murdered him. Oh, gee doesn't know how to feel about this, because if he, like knows these deities personally, or at least one of them.

02:44:32

Personally, i think he has the right to speak like that. But OG's like dude I'll show the god's chill out. They can hear you. The gods are allowed to be as flawed as anyone else. That's, that's the thing, the familiar that the chosen One Paladin gets is a direct emissary from the gods.

02:44:53

Yeah, this is. So what we're discovering is that my earlier comment about way n being like, some will come, it's actually quite accurate in the traditional journey to the west kind of way certainly, but he doesn't want to be compared to that chaotic. Like fucktard bubbly, don't know anything about them.

02:45:16

Other things is a monkey and apparently having for uh, not stopping violence. That's about it, that's noise. Let me tell you about the time he stole the immortal peaches from from schizuru's garden. Okay, the dude has no sense of boundaries or law it's despicable, he gives monkeys a bad name everywhere.

02:45:45

The entire venara race for that matter all. Just like him. Okay, now that makes me sound a little racist. Yeah, not. Oh, she's gonna be like, i need you to calm down with the generalization's way in. You're getting into some dangerous too. You're here. We need you down here.

02:46:07

Look, he has responsibilities. He's supposed to do in heaven. Right, buddy, spins centuries. Sometimes just wandering glarion friend way when you're already trending on twitter, stop it.

02:46:29

Twitter. Is it is that something that ochi does? It's it's what it's what me and my pals called the the bird network. That i talked to every time. Okay, like you you just see like two crows up on a branch and they're just shaking their heads. Disapprovingly it way in, and they fly off.

02:46:53

Oh goodness. All right. I'll settle down. You know the twitter icon isn't a bird non-secutor here. It's like in the employee contracts that they're never to refer to it as a bird or draw it as a bird. They're treated as the twitter logo. Specifically that's weird and fucked up.

02:47:25

Um, so what do we find in the forest of? We'll run that name by me again. Oh, yes. Uh, the wood of winter's deadly roar,

02:47:44

Well, what do i know about this place? I mean, we're getting close enough to the wall, but like maybe i, i'll feel maybe i could start making my geography checks.

02:48:00

Okay, yeah, that's fine.

02:48:11

I ain't gonna like they didn't really give me a lot of information for this place.

02:48:42

Yeah, there's not a lot of information. I assume would of winter's. Deadly roar has a cool story to it, but if they gave that information to me, i don't know where it is. I do not see it anywhere in the book. Let me translate it to you into scald.

02:48:57

It's fucking cold. That's fair. Very windy. Very cold, by which i'm in. It's not actually that cold. I'm disappointed also known for the galloping furry giant spiders. I'm sorry.

02:49:25

Just choke up.

02:49:31

I, i don't like this. I don't like them. Please make them stop.

02:49:39

Oh, no. The hand isn't in the, in the, in the, in the tools. I can't i can't, i can't click it and fake having a rectaphobia. So we skip this encounter. How do i, how do i undo?

02:49:59

Now, spiders have never bothered me except when the bloodborne spiders are fucking more, right? Real spider is freaked me out. You know what put actual fear in me? Every time i ran into them, the scorpions in new vegas. The rad scorpions. I am going to blow up the art a little bit for people to see.

02:50:21

This is read out of the book. Uh, they look like big white furry. Tarantulas, that's awesome. Oh yeah. That's good stuff. Financials are great. They're, they're very fluffy, very cuddly. The sukio have a problem with me stabbing things horrendously, when they look like they're about to eat us. No, i like smokyo.

02:50:55

Considering we're close to the main kind, that they feel. Oh, are we close to me? Okay. No, there's probably like a good bit after the wall of heaven, you are going down into hungle through this path. I don't know. I'll go pull up my map. I have really good.

02:51:12

Change your map. I was gonna say we're close to tien and we're we encounter giant spider enemies and it's not. Um such a coma. Uh, nope, just giant spiders. Nothing really special about these. I don't even know why they're in scripted encounter. We designed these giants snow spiders. We need to fucking use some somewhere.

02:51:46

It's there literally just a variant of the giant tarantula. Can i roll nature to see if i can think know anything? That's weird or different about them. Yeah, go and get your knowledge natures out. Now, you were not surprised by this.

02:52:16

So it's okay. I've been rolling amazingly. Well, today, like you were the one who stole our roles who are damn earlier, you did this. I got, it was so bad. I had two roles that were above 10. Thank god. They were the ones to kill them.

02:52:40

He almost party wiped on a mushroom. Oh dear.

02:52:47

They'll get you.

02:53:02

I don't know. Was it a punchy mushroom? Like in dark souls, uh, it was kind of like a punchy. Mushrooms. It took me out with a single crate. It jumped from the tree and landed on my face and then proceeded to knock out two other people in the party.

02:53:20

And we had this like whackamole party thing happen. Oh, she's gonna move here and, uh, drawing a sword as he does and go total defense.

02:53:45

Did everyone hit their breast buttons? And this.

02:53:51

Yeah, Grayson and i never healed up but we did take the rest. Healing. Yeah, good and heal yourselves. This is a whole new day. Yeah. We have we have all the healing resources to help you guys. When i get back in the game i will i hit reload on the page and stuck on.

02:54:10

Look downloading world data and ah then i will go ahead and do that for you.

02:54:25

And put grace in initiative.

02:54:34

All right. So these things don't have like weird mug sizes, right?

02:54:49

Are you asking if i can see what you're in school? Oh, absolutely. You should notice by now. Uh, nope, just dark vision. That's a shame for them.

02:55:10

I'm gonna double move to like there.

02:55:39

Equation.

02:55:47

I was finally expecting you to say yes. Of course, they have tremosomes. All right? No, not those kind of spiders.

02:56:00

Joko.

02:56:06

Uh,

02:56:14

Sugar will go with.

02:56:23

Uh, sugar will go with in inspire courage.

02:56:33

So, everyone throw that on, uh,

02:56:41

What level is that at now?

02:56:47

Uh, because of eight eight? Yeah.

02:57:33

Space and you still have in trouble.

02:57:39

Uh, yep. Okay, and for my action, um, We'll go. What's up this? Because these are, these are spiders. They're not very smart. So, we'll play around some illusions here.

02:58:02

Uh and we'll put like an illusion of uh no way with her knives out. Ready to fight this spider right in front of him.

02:58:19

I will be right back.

02:58:26

My that box?

02:58:38

Oh no.

02:58:45

Okay, it's okay. You can just make it as well. I know that it's it's like it's fine.

02:58:58

Um, move the image within the limits of the size of the effect. So she'll be a ducking and weaving and like, uh, making the fight thing.

02:59:11

All right, well, it definitely rears up and Flicks it here.

02:59:27

Nothing halfway through damage.

02:59:34

Into any damage.

02:59:40

Uh, it hits and nothing happens, of course, but now it gets video case. It's still believes, it's her because dodged greasing

03:00:02

Grayson shoots something.

03:00:07

Are you still loading in? And says you're in still on the screen. Assist downloading world data. Yep.

03:00:32

Know, click that.

03:00:51

This one.

03:00:57

Very cleaning both attack.

03:01:04

Well, i should not roll for you, Grayson.

03:01:11

Uh, are these all against his black-blooded?

03:01:20

Even it's flat footed is 20 Spell, natural armor, thick fur. Boo boo. It's racing happens. Inspire courage on. Yep, that's unfortunate.

03:01:54

Like these two on this.

03:02:05

Pieces, that's clear.

03:02:12

She does get to add her wisdom to that.

03:02:18

Boop b. Boop. Boop.

03:02:38

Why is it still getting the bonnet? Okay. Oh, because That's where.

03:02:53

Okay, target.

03:03:03

It doesn't hit you. That's a mess.

03:03:10

All these one more closer? Oh, gee

03:03:19

Oh no, it was sick. It can reach. Where's my inspire courage. We have that on, right? You should nobody seems to be missing it as well. Whoops, there we go. Oh, g. And let me know if this is legal because i've been worrying wondering about how this works. Can i switch my katana to my offhand and make it full attack?

03:03:46

Let sure you can with my main hand. Yeah, of course, bro, to draw sherry can or to switch hands with my guitar cherry can or treated his ammunition and can be drawn freely {question-mark}. I honestly can't remember it's in the description of shuriken they're treated as ammunition. So the same way that grace and draws arrows is the way that i draw.

03:04:10

Sure. You can just throw them, i should probably know this but i don't. Um, does that sound kosher? Yeah. No, that's that's completely accurate. Cool. Because they only do a d2 damage times two critical. So, they have to have some sort of advantage indeed. So we're forgotten tricking into flurry of stars, just doing this for bookkeeping for my key points.

03:04:41

So, i get many attacks with, i'm sure you cans.

03:04:57

Says i'm out. Oh i didn't select it. Gosh this. I never use these buttons.

03:05:12

I didn't check the deadly inbox on that. Third one. Congratulations me. Boo. Boo.

03:05:30

And cute and cute.

03:05:40

So, it looks like all about one of them hit.

03:05:46

I thought i checked in on the first one too, but i don't have deadly aim on there either. That's okay. I just wanted to see how that went for me and that's gonna do they quite well? Yeah. And that's going to be OG's. Turn no way. Thou art invisible, still Indeed, and they seem none aware of your presence.

03:06:06

Can everybody see in a way? Because i can see, no way and i haven't changed anything on my toes. Yeah. I created a duplicated version of an illusion and when one of them, says all the others with all, uh, okay, just making sure i'm not crazy.

03:06:22

It's also go fault. But what is my fault?

03:06:32

I got distracted. What happened? What is my fault?

03:06:38

Oh, that noise. Invisible now. Well, now, she's visible because she's visible. Yeah, just fyi, because i know that i shouldn't be able to see, no way. That's why i didn't move into flanking because OG was trying to stay with the party and get them. Now, you can see no way.

03:06:55

Yes. But that's why you see like like no way from the back of it. One of its legs just flies off. Uh, yeah, you just reduced its plus 14, natural armor to nine. Natural armor volleyball, isn't it? Uh, a lot of natural armor. And then she disappears, i will not hit the button because i do not want to make sure illusion.

03:07:26

Oh no, that's fine. You can, you can

03:07:39

We know the aliens there and it's distracted by it.

03:07:48

Boom. Boom, uh, mayco being. I'll make a low is gonna charge.

03:08:05

Double check, then it doesn't have. Ridiculous bonus to hit because of something. I missed. It does have a good to hit, but

03:08:27

Make up the bite.

03:08:39

Now.

03:08:43

Oh, sh I updated an omeco that was on a map, not her face sheet. This, i'm gonna go is once again under levels. I don't know how you'd man. It's impressed because i keep accidentally leveling her on a specific map instead of just through her sheet.

03:09:15

That is more accurate.

03:09:22

And she swings. I also got a plus two today. Doesn't matter google.

03:09:33

Oh, and actually she wants action from my illusion disappear. Oh, okay. Uh, i'm ako. Might be standing on it. Oh,

03:09:57

It's awesome but like, ah, that's right. That's what it's fine. I know that i'm invitable time. It doesn't know your invisible, it's very confused. It thinks that the very air has turned against it for they are stupid. Yeah, they have an intelligence of zero so it doesn't take an action or anything for me to like, have no way move around.

03:10:27

Uh, so i'll just have her like, i can't control her. I'm just going to have her like, do more than a five foot step like downs. Like like down just to draw an attack of opportunity in case that helps

03:10:49

Is from my turn. I will move forward. It actually already used second opportunity.

03:11:05

Forward a bit. Um,

03:11:20

Yeah. Yeah. This guy, this guy.

03:11:28

Look at me if my horse my horse is amazing. Give it a lick it's just like crazy.

03:11:42

Good damage and enter.

03:11:52

Ah, tempting things. Tempting things. Hi it attacks. I'm a go low. It attacks. The illusion. Hello it attacks. The illusion.

03:12:05

Um, john and it was a dc. 17 to just believe, wait in roaming, the affected by illusions.

03:12:22

This is one of those weird ones where it's like, um, i think it can we'll say yes and he still hasn't succeeded in disbelieving. It, this was also my lock cases of mind affecting does. I mean i couldn't have used that.

03:12:46

It's fine. This isn't like a game breaking encounter. This is some spiders in the woods.

03:13:00

I hate Grayson. Yep, i'm begging the game, your first, two hits. Your last three myths, though. Yeah, no. They're just, it's great. Some secretly have a fear of spiders is silent image. Mind affecting. Uh, yes. Oh no. It's not that it affects vermin. It's a pigment. Yeah, then affects them.

03:13:28

Yeah, lock gaze. Does not though. That was a mistake on my car, okay. So oh yeah, you fucked around. You found out and yeah.

03:13:43

Uh, let's see if coyote has turned. No one is actually looking bad. No way. Our, i'm gonna kill yourself.

03:14:01

From home, she didn't have to move.

03:14:16

Patent. IOchie. Oh wow. He really missed. He rule the four. Yes, but spider like tries to bite the ground. Next to you completely missing you OG will roll up on him and his life. Not even gonna try and faint. Are you going to acrobatics though? Yeah, for that. Small of a distance.

03:14:46

We can do that. Let's say that's a no that is, that is not enough for it is a multi-legged creature sir? Yes, it is. So they're CMDs are quite unfortunate hecka. Hi Jewish wing.

03:15:08

Oh, i think he's still missed. He do prison. That damage is no joke though. No it's not but it's only got a plus 11 here. Is it evil? I it is not. It is very neutral. It is hungry, the spider is uninterested in your mornings. That's heartbreaking. That's actually even, that's even more, like beyond what it's capable of conceptualizing to OT.

03:15:41

Did a big fat mess that is unfortunately a miss. That's okay. That that'll be OT stern. Also, by the way, i love that you've linked your contacted abilities into your attacks, it's neat. Yes, it took a while to figure out, but it helps me to keep track of them like, for a long time, i don't think i had weapon focus in any of my attacks until like level eight.

03:16:06

So, no way.

03:16:18

So the first attack is going to get a plus two, i'm not going to one. Strips out under the fire. There soon. Very unfortunate.

03:16:52

Um,

03:16:57

That is that is extra unfortunate.

03:17:05

See if it's actually close it. Yeah, it does that crits then.

03:17:16

And then it dies. I'm serious as to why that's not rolling. My secondary attack on these weapons because they should be doing full attacks. Are you click useful attack? I am, i don't see an iterative attack on there, i know, but i have been affinity. So something weird is going on here.

03:17:44

I need to fix that. But are you liking the iterative attack formula and the weapons statistics? Yeah, if you didn't uh type it in. It's like the BAB formula and the iterative attack box then it doesn't just make one for you automatically. You have to actually put that formula in for the 6BAB to kick in and like do that i have identified.

03:18:04

I'm not just so i will be putting that in now. We will not have this problem in the future. Yeah, it's easy. If um, because i don't know how good you are the foundry language. If you just go to want to, oh, cheese and scroll down. He's gotten pretty good.

03:18:19

I i don't calculate anything on the shit. Yeah i would have to google what the formula is. If it didn't already we all have the learn them from somewhere. We didn't just know them. These are the foundries advanced, all right with it for you know. It which is spider.

03:18:39

Murder vicious. Spider motor that was a full attack action. Yeah. And then i presume that other things gonna fuck and die. She just kind of rubs off her sorts just

03:19:00

Today, i have to move.

03:19:13

But um, a mako made it through an entire fight without dropping guys. Incredible. Absolutely flawless. Please do not heal the sweater. That's burgers. Just like, oh no. I'm so sorry. I just, like, resurrects. What's my face? You were doing so well.

03:19:43

Okay. So um using in nature, check, where do i think these things like nest is like maybe we can find like other prey that they strung up. Maybe like, you know, travelers maybe we could get loot from that. I'm trying to find a reason for this again. I actually think the tarantula drops standard treasure.

03:20:11

Let me double check though. So we do tear open though. The the spider sack, with the most awful sound effect in all of Skyrim. No, you find it layer where it has its bodies uh and has incidental treasure.

03:20:40

Let me on two macho's generator. Standard incidental. Animal. I've been doing cholesterols on the several and because of the 3d days, the unbound of dice that shows up on my screen now.

03:20:58

Okay. But damn rocks. Well, all right. That's a hell of a horrid. Actually, apparently these guys have eaten quite a few people.

03:21:16

That box.

03:21:24

One day.

03:21:33

Is quite the amount of gemstones. You find? Maybe they just like collecting shiny rocks from around the world. Since many of these rocks, don't form anywhere near each other.

03:21:54

Clearly, some tradesman from Hongo was coming through and did not survive the path of eigenheim.

03:22:21

And i think that is the last thing before you hit jogging. It is.

03:22:37

Congratulations. Guys, you have made it almost to the end of the path of agony.

03:22:48

You reached the small town of jogging.

03:22:55

If we get that on the map, i am working on. It house is joking. Try and kill us again. Doesn't try to kill you, actually.

03:23:12

Doubt.

03:23:19

So john gene is a neutral, small town with the qualities of prosperous and strategic location. Once the caravans ascends from aborticure passive enters, the lands of awesome of the awesome. Confederations surrounding lake burien. The town of jogging stands square in the path of agony. Unlike all engoran, the citizens here have little interest in you, or your caravan.

03:23:48

By the way, they were the ones that the last time you were in, told the only of the five storms were to find you. Yeah. Yeah. Those rumoring on those rumor mongering citizens.

03:24:05

Wow. Do they actually have twitter play? How did they get that to the only the method spell, sending other associated things? They probably have agents. Okay, now it's when we get to do the big sell-offs. Oh yeah, you got you a small town. Oh, okay.

03:24:45

I mean, they could only buy seven thousand five hundred worth and we've got 70 thousand to sell. Hey it's uh it's a substance and i'm pretty sure that over item value isn't it. Or is that max they can do per visit? I was jiggling it earlier and i think it's maximum.

03:25:24

Like the the highest amount they can purchase right or just max gold, they can sew they can give you a via selling, i don't think i've ever known. I've never had to use 3d statistics. This often a settlements purchase limit is the most money. A shop in the settlement can spend you purchase any single item, from the pcs.

03:25:46

Yeah. So, you can fill up anything that's under 7500 gold nails. Actually, you can. Yeah, it's worth that much. So anything up to 15 grams and it's raw value. We can now. So yeah, because you sell it to have press. Yeah. All right. So, um, i'm sorry. The purchase limit is 7500 gold pieces, right?

03:26:11

I want to make sure we're on the same page. They can buy stuff from us as a single item. That's not the overall purchase limit that they could buy from us. Right. So did you say 15 thousand? I thought you said 1500. Okay, that makes more sense. So first thing um well let's let's go through here.

03:26:31

What do we really want to keep? Uh the potions, the light consumables are always nice to keep because you never know.

03:26:45

Really for cheek consumerals. There, there is a column, column e that is cell. Yes, no. And if you want it to be held on to put an end in there, yeah.

03:27:24

I'm gonna sell all the non-magical stuff that's like well the gems and masterwork items we found yeah because those are all those are all definitely under

03:27:38

Yeah, the only things we can't really sell is the cube of frost resistance and the staff of journeys. Everything else can basically, if you gave coyote, this happened journeys, we talked about this while you were gone on the break and we didn't think anybody was using it.

03:28:06

And we should probably keep, we should probably keep a terracotta statues as well. Those could be useful and an important to know if you gave coya the Seth journeys. Oh yeah. Yeah. I think we gave the oil. The stack journeys? Yeah, because i betnets you all bonus points with her.

03:28:28

Yeah, like he uses that as a walking stick. Now.

03:28:36

Sorry about my management. You're okay. Welcome back. I know like i think i i've seen what it did does. Um, the uh, the gem of brightness. Despite being really expensive. No, no, that great. I think we're final selling it. I mean i don't know what it is because i haven't looked yet, but i'm gonna look right now, but the lot of these only have been able to do darkness at will also which is kind of a big deal.

03:29:13

It doesn't have anything to do with darkness though. It doesn't. I was just going off in the day i'm currently looking up the rules.

03:29:24

It just blinds things and it's a DC 14. So, i mean, ray was using that shield of blinding until end of last book, and that was a DC with 12 13. It's still works. Things were control. Bad more importantly, so just the carry on that conversation. Um, if i'm remembering correctly, the general brightness is made with daylight.

03:29:52

So, most of its spells probably resolve at third. I said spells it's a facts resolve it uh spell level three at a castle level six which makes sense so yeah, it probably resolve a daylight so it cancels darkness, right? It's like i thought i was that, it's correct. Yeah, it counteracts deeper darkness.

03:30:20

Yeah, we're gonna hold on. Yeah, because it glows as well. And that doesn't expend any charges. Okay. It's, it's a lot better than i thought. Yeah, it's got 50 charges. It's a brand new gym.

03:30:41

Yeah, it is not a bad item but i can see why you would want to 5400 gold pieces per person. It definitely warrants a conversation.

03:30:59

It's demo of brightness, is 13 thousand, sorry to sell. I was just looking at the, oh, i was, i have the, uh, you would cut that in half, i looked at the table wrong and it was, i was looking at the cube of frost resistance price because on the sheet that grayson has their next to each other.

03:31:15

And that's i do the 27 divided by five and i didn't have it yet. So i was like, how much is the cube across for this since 20 fat, 27 thousand by value. They fucking put one of those in the game. Jesus christ. That's something. They expect you to blow it up.

03:31:32

Well, that's true. So yeah this is no joke before it did what it was supposed to do though. Before nice and started selling stuff. We were at 70 thousand gold pieces itself. Value people have kind of picked the, the most expensive things for us to hold on to. So yeah, well you say that like that's disappointing but at least we got items that we've actually decided are cool to keep.

03:32:01

Yeah, well, i mean, a lot of these are just sitting in alutless, like no one's putting them on their sheets and using them. Yeah, i hadn't looked at the terracotta warrior. Let me go look at that. Because if it's cool, we can talk about that one and get it for somebody.

03:32:16

I don't know. Where is the sheep boy?

03:32:24

We go. Uh what about the cuba? Frost resistance are people wanting to keep that or no. Um yes. Yes we are. Absolutely wanted to keep that, huh? That's been incredibly. What? Oh well, the sashimano comfort is on the caravan loot sheet now so you can remove that. Yeah, i've got it on here but noted as it's not exactly attached to the character, there's a keep section and there's notes and stuff.

03:32:54

And got a lot of stuff. Lots of potions and oils. Yeah, that's the thing. It's like all these questions as oils. Like the hoarder in me is saying like, yes, you want to keep all of this. We never know when we might need the wand of color spray. But then that's part of me, this would be more reasonable.

03:33:13

It's like you think? I mean realistically, you're probably never going to use colors for you, unless it's like a joke or you're just like, oh look a group of goblins color, spray and walk away. Yeah. Um so personal opinion potion of magic tongue is kind of near the hand of that so that means we have to go just burn it.

03:33:37

Um, scroll protection from chaos, actually is kind of useful very funny. And i think only zeal potentially uh i might go has the ring of feather falling.

03:33:53

Pushing a box in or pretty good. Yes, i will take the talisman of warrior if nobody else wants it, but i'm also open into selling it. They are really good. You get a reroll and you get a spiritual ally or for the horse, you get re-roll. And you get a phantom steed, pretty solid.

03:34:16

Pretty solid. Okay. So put put them on your cheek and remove it from the luchee i just wanted. Yeah. Before i took it, i just want to make sure people were cool with that. I will pull it off.

03:34:34

I do. Look at this loot sheet. I just haven't needed much. Uh, oil Los angeles. There is no single thing on here that i particularly care about. So yeah, all the scrolls and potions and ones that i have in that lower section. Um don't think anyone's actually going to use and so it was planning on just selling it all types of questions.

03:35:03

I'll take some potions of dark skin barkston, the portion of pass without trace might be useful in some circumstances. Depending on how all you want to deal with things in Mankai, i'm gonna talk to the scripts. Oh, is the scroll appeala there? I was like kind of effect of the coaching of shield other work.

03:35:23

Yeah, that no.

03:35:30

Um why is there only an air elemental gym on here? Couldn't swore. You've also gotten an earth in a fire one.

03:35:40

Ever told about or it's already been long sold back here. College earlier. Remember making a joke about finding all four of them.

03:35:57

All right, all over on. The the horse terracotta and the dark skin potions on my sheet funny i'll be back alone removing the warrior terracotta so that you can have it on your sheet tune it i'd like forge to kick out. I use a place so that i can actually play happiness.

03:36:26

Thank you.

03:36:32

Uh, sugar. We assuming that you're holding the cube of frost resistance since you held. Yeah, yeah, okay, yeah. So, make sure she

03:36:43

Uh, who wants to hold the gemma brightness? Then.

03:36:49

I've definitely don't for obvious reasons. I think it should go on somebody who stays back like you or koya. Because and like i'm gonna be close to abby all the time. Illuminating, the hell out of her. If i carry it, you kind of poly, katana, nothing doesn't boil. I'd be surprised, i don't think it does.

03:37:12

I read the description and i'm i might have missed something but it doesn't say anything about glowing.

03:37:20

Is that specific one? No! It just holy weapon property. Oh yeah. No, there's a 50% chance of any magic weapon being flowy. I remember him. Sorry, i remember. Did he and saying something about it glowing? But i think that was when the unnamed samurai like, did something with it, like when he was attacked in the undead he mentioned.

03:37:44

Did he mentioned it glowing? But like a? Okay. Hey didion. What does my sword glow?

03:37:57

You know what? I didn't roll for that. There we go. Did you made a show of the animation, quote unquote, when the unnamed samurai fought the whites with it? That it, like, did fire or glowing or something. But we would like to know, actually, we believe i recall it glowing with golden flames, golden flames.

03:38:21

Like the alma top two blames. Yeah, so i think we're thinking of gem and brightness going to either a mako or koya.

03:38:35

Uh i think it brings sometimes with coya. Yeah, because it may go sword also glows. So we have like light all over the place. Sadly for Abby. Okay, brightness to queer. I mean that's a screen. She doesn't have prepared daylight.

03:38:56

All right. Well, everything else said. I'm not knowing that you did you want the job of brightness? Hell. No. Oh okay. I was like that. Seems a little i don't care. No no i was like oh okay. You know. Of course owner does not to prep gala every day.

03:39:20

Bang it, excellent, fantastic. Oh yeah, it's nice. Me for ninja. I'm gonna be over there. Fuck off away. Once we finished through all the cold areas, i'll look to price out and sell out all like, the cold weather outfits. And doubles and skates, and all that random stuff that we were carrying.

03:40:01

How's everyone looking on their shopping? Uh, well. What's our total gold? I just posted it in discord right when he said that bear and nice. Okay, that is a lot more than i was expecting. Uh, okay. So, you're unfortunate that your base value is only 1400.

03:40:30

But i have a chance of finding something else thinking.

03:40:39

I'm sticking out actually, what was their actual thing that we've got hair and items?

03:41:14

Almost 100 to purchase that eight of Falls.

03:41:52

So, just confirm if i wanted to buy crafting supplies, the most i could buy is 7500 gold worth. It's a the purchase limit is any single item. So as long as it's under the base value, the individual things that you're buying, you're probably good to go.

03:42:21

I said that backwards the purchase limit is what they can buy. The base value is what we can buy in a single item.

03:42:31

Okay. I could only buy 1400 gold worth. No, yeah. On a single item, you can, you can buy plenty of crafting supplies, right? So, what's the limit on crafting supplies? Well, they're all if it's not, if you don't buy one magic craft material making machine, that makes all the little things that you need.

03:42:55

That's over 1400 gold, you can buy a like this. That's 500, this that's 200. This is a thousand and even if it totals more than the base value you're still good. I believe, yeah, basically, what i hear you telling me is you want to spend your 7131 gold on crafting supplies to use for crafting items.

03:43:15

That's totally fine. You're buying a bunch of basic enchantment, gear, enchantment, and and preparing for the items that you want to make. Okay, they're not actually buying an item and i don't want to go through each individual item and figure out how much those items you have to buy cost, quite frankly, that's too much map for me too much bookkeeping.

03:43:50

It broke out of you by saying too much bookkeeping.

03:45:42

Boom fun. So it says on there, i think, also, if i go oh, i close the tab, isn't it? Always fun.

03:46:39

So i'm gonna sell OG's magic double walking stick katana that he got in book two end of book two. Um, and i can't sell it for what, it's actually worth but what it's actually worth is very near to the purchase limit and the rules say that i can lower the price and just give it to them for the purchase limit.

03:47:02

Perfect. I want to make sure that that's kosher before i put the money on my sheet. So sans i just found an item for a thousand gold that feels like it would be kind of broken at this price, since it's, it's soft mind reading. It's called a decorum band.

03:47:20

Are you familiar? And i am not here, put in general. I'm like, well the brace your foot easily on the wrist growing cutting into the skin and putting on. So where have any action that could cause the creatures attitude towards the where it shipped negatively No, that's a common sense.

03:47:45

Leaper. That's that's not the tech sites that me telling you. That's a bad idea to do. We'll shift their latitude towards you negatively. Oh yeah. But what i'm thinking is like talking to some random in minkai, i could be like. So i think that Jake region is awful and that, the proper emperor should probably return.

03:48:09

And then, the decorum bed would tell me, you shouldn't say that. And then I'd be like, oh this person is avoid was done and is correct. You could feasibly exploit it like that? I'm not gonna roleplay you talking to all of those people though.

03:48:30

Oh when we get into minkai, it's not going to become like a more like a social intriguing campaign. It's totally going to be.

03:48:43

Well, there will be some

03:48:49

But not like war for the crown levels of injury.

03:48:56

Okay, sorry we are going to be like doing basically a war from the crown once we get in there. I was expecting it to be. Uh yeah. I was expecting a complete shift in tone from what we've been doing up. Until now, there's a slight shifting tone warp of the crown really expanded on the social systems.

03:49:19

Uh, you will still be doing. Put that in chat. There's gonna be some.

03:49:34

But not an entire book of it or three books of it, i should say.

03:49:45

Oh, i could just have grace and make this for me because it's a wonderous item. Yeah and like he just put in chat. Something that makes sense, right? Yeah. If it's gonna be clear, master craftsman, has a limitation in that you are limited to what you craft. It is made of leather.

03:50:10

Uh, so that was require leather working.

03:50:15

Considering it's a thousand gold. I can just buy it because it's under the price here that you

03:50:31

Oh um, ochio is looking it up. The the gloves of arcane strike. Can you put on it? The say they are soft. Leather gloves, do? They have to be made of leather.

03:50:47

Uh, don't know. Therefore a mako. So dirian, i was gonna buy a, mako, some gloves of arcane striking. Grayson, if he could craft them. So it's a leather versus cloth situation on the flavor. Text of a pair of gloves, i'll take the gold back, it was for a mako, it does have that feet but they also require rows of misceral rivets.

03:51:21

They do.

03:51:26

But no, those those would not be covered under cloth. That is that is very much leather in metal working. Okay, i will take those, she would actually benefit quite a bit from those. Yeah, they're pretty cool and they're not that expensive she does. In fact have arching strike one of her go to feeds.

03:51:44

Well, i was until she got you know, okay oh no. Okay. So uchi make sure you get your money back. Yeah i was just totallying it up to add back onto my sheet. Thank you. What's. What's the maximum value that we can roll for to try and find 1400?

03:52:06

Oh, so i i have to roll for the decorum band. I imagine that that's over the it's only a thousand gold. So it's a 75% chance that it's there base values, okay? Yeah. All right.

03:52:30

All right, not there anyways.

03:52:35

All of that subposition was not useful for now.

03:52:42

I like the idea, though. And it doesn't make much sense to find one of those out here in the middle of nowhere. Anyways, it really don't not a lot of politicking and stuff going around here.

03:53:12

Oh, we rolled for the sword but we or we didn't. But we decided that it goes with golden flame. Yes. Okay.

03:54:22

Boy, christian hasn't been this broken a long time. You guys have been rolling across the north with like a bunch of fucking money. One whole wagon is just devoted to coinage and treasure.

03:54:56

And you're gonna be back.

03:55:08

Where i to give grace and my belt to upgrade it, i would not be allowed to wear it for the time that he's crafting on it, right? Correct. Yeah.

03:55:21

And what would you do for the cost? Just subtract the next level from the previous level. And then i mean i would check the current price from the price of the next level that makes sense. Yeah, instead of making a negative shit. Yeah, that makes sense.

03:55:40

Uh, okay. So, what about, uh, i'm gonna make another roll for another, uh, 1k item. I'm gonna look for some boots of the cat.

03:55:53

Boots of the cat.

03:55:59

You find them.

03:56:08

Oh, it's nice time there.

03:56:33

All right, greyson, how you doing on time? Do you have to leave yet? No today, i'm good. Okay, there is a oh boy. There is a movie reference in this book that i have been waiting for. You guys to reach, you have finally reached it.

03:57:01

Well.

03:59:12

And just like, oh that's what i was looking at. I was gonna say and just like that, i forgot what i was searching for because i replied to that.

03:59:22

But what i mean abby and chat.

04:02:31

All right. Well.

04:02:36

I think we might have to call it. Yeah. Well, we'll do the movie reference next time. Yeah, everyone can just spend their money's now and we'll call it per year for this week. I got stupid money animals and myself for strong hungry. Me too. We made carnitas i'm jealous.

04:02:57

They came out really, really good. I hope that's almost better. Um, can i have a very 50 50 on next? Second in Chinese, in this house, let me hit you with it. It's so rough. Let me hit you with a question before you go because i'm not good at this stuff.

04:03:12

Buying a potion. Spell. Level fly. So it's based volleyball would be fifth because the third little cell, which is what it'll auto set to, if you drag the spell onto your inventory tab. So for like potion, okay, i will try that if it should set it to the minimum caster level, the caps, the spell,

04:03:53

Might also prove me wrong, though.

04:04:00

Yes. Spell, level caster, level spell. Level three. Caster level 5, perfect.

04:04:08

So, but my real question was the price so that it's level three for everyone level three spells depending on the class. It looks like the depending on the school of magic. Basically, the table i'm looking at is very confusing, but i see from 750 to a thousand fifty. No.

04:04:34

I mean i assume you're gonna get fly as a cleric drew to wizard. So it's 750. Okay, cool beans, which isn't even on there, and which is what their primary spellcaster is in the village. So, we'll just call it a wizard.

04:04:52

Works for me.

04:04:56

Uh, i got a crafting sessions for you, not now i don't have the microphone now, but eventually, if i looked into making my own, uh, showsuku of the nightwind, you know, the things that um, no way has part of it, is it gives a plus, two armor bones without it actually being armor.

04:05:17

Uh, would that be something that i could after making it then pay to increase that armor bonus as if it was like bracers of armor. So your AC can be 50 would allow that. Yeah.

04:05:35

Which might be something. You could talk to no way about as well, letting her youth that because it is cloth you could enhance them. Yeah, well, i think she gets a lot of use out of it because of, like, because extra bonus for ninjas. Yeah, it would greatly help her though.

04:05:54

What Didion is saying is if she wants to spend the money enhance her armor also because her AC is very garbage 2018. It's very, very bad. And that might help her out in fights where things can see her. Because right now, our whole bag is just being visible and we're getting into the territory where that's not helping anymore.

04:06:24

No, i think i got all my shopping done. Um, i'm very excited. I have no more questions about stuff because i have successfully spent most of my money again.

04:06:38

I only spent one k, i'm gonna try and save up to until we get to like like a real bigger big city and try and pick up a flight speed of some kind, because it's getting absurd at this point. Yeah, everything's flying, same thing. I had a couple things i wanted to trade out and upgrade and stuff.

04:07:00

And the next thing i gotta buy is um is some fly because oh gee sure kids are not good. Okay, it's flying creatures.

04:07:25

All right, y'all. I'm going to go make sure that we all eat. So thanks guys. This was fun. I'll get to work on those recaps. And, uh, once it's all caught up, i'll publish it and get you guys a link. I'm gonna go eat. Bye. See, and see. So, you tomorrow,
