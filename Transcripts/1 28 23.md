00:33

Best with shoko's UMD. Check just as many scrolls and wands as i can carry. Hello, hello. Hello. Hello. Chi oh shoot, we're going to need you to take a few levels and wizard from here on out. We need, we need an arcanecaster, everybody. Since i told anyone anywhere about this build idea was like you should just play omegas.

00:59

I'm like, you're right now again. No, so i i'm gonna lean up and go into it because the amigo is normally supposed to be a bar, but we had shoko. So the party didn't need a barge. So, i switched to more of a tonki build, but now we have grace and an OT being able to handle their own in melee.

01:20

So arcane she can be a sorceress with a level of paladin little gitch build again. This is the magic of the imperial bloodline. She gets to swap classes like the warrior of light. Yes. Oh, there's a comparison. So roll me back, though. Why why do we need an arcane spellcaster?

01:49

Because we're losing zio. Yes, i think it also. Yeah. For like the utility of having spells available. I love low magic. I hate that everything is flying.

02:09

Um, okay, so i do have a question. What? I never looked into the rules for retraining. Oh good. I'm also ready. Go about retraining a skill and a feat. Is that a just stuff? I have to pay money for and then wait a certain amount of in-game time. It's there's a formula for it.

02:31

If you go right to the page for retraining for a feet, it's like a week or so, if you have a trainer, yeah, to replace a feet, you have to find somebody with that feet. So, back in cow's guard when Shogo decided to swap out a bunch of his combat feets.

02:51

For extra tales. She'll go ahead to go meditate with the local Kate Stude population for two weeks and like get in touch with his inner foxy self. You can read, i'll redo the skill ranks, retraining right now. So, you can retrain skill ranks. You have assigned, two skills, retraining skill rates, takes five, that was a weird way to make that sense.

03:19

Retraining scale rags takes five days. When the training period ends reassign, a number of skill, ranks up to your intelligence bonus, minimum one removing them from your existing skill or skills, and adding them to a different skill or skills. If retraining skill ranks needs you no longer qualify for feeder other ability, you have you can't use that feet or ability until you meet the qualifications again or you can retrain that feat or other ability.

03:45

So grace and has plus telling us modifier plus one. So it would be every five days. He can move one skill point out, and put it in a new one, right? Yes. But that's also all you're doing for those fuck that five days. Yeah, this should be said that.

04:04

Retraining, I'll go back up to the top because i was looking at this the other day. First of all, this is so complicated. I love pathfinder. This is amazing. Uh, it takes all of your focus. You can't like travel or adventure or anything like that for the number of training montage.

04:21

Yeah, you do training montage. You climb the tree with your feet, okay? So then i think i will start looking out for times where we're not doing anything. I'm also looking to start slowly adjusting grace into no longer have knowledge of history and instead have an additional craft of leather working.

04:44

Yo, you know, i out for a master leather worker to switch out, vital strike, which i just took to eventually get master craftsman for that to kind of build everything every wondrous item. Crafting, man. There's a, there's a lot more items that i thought that have some sort of aspect of leather involved in the.

05:09

Yeah, there is i'll just ask a question then. Does anybody have combat reflexes? Yes, amiko's combat, reflexes sick. So when and if a training montage happens i would like to do that. I had one point i had talked about switching something for improved unarmed strike and i was like at the end of a session, i changed my mind and put back whatever i had before and put the gold back on my sheet just for full transparency because i changed my mind on the future.

05:42

Build. I just need to swap one for combat reflexes whenever the opportunity arises,

05:54

Oh, two weapon fighting. That's what it is. Lol, actually no, i wanted to drop some ninja levels, too. So this is going to be complicated. It's all coming back to me. I was working on the recap most of my brain was very in that. Oh so here's here's the thing.

06:11

You guys don't have to rush through the north. You are in an area of relative palm now on the high eyes and in this pseudo populated area before you guys descend into angle, you can stay in the ice and train you can hunt to feed yourselves. There's wilderness again, you are, you are free from the undead.

06:33

We have reached a point where you can literally just set up shop for a bit. I just didn't want to hold up the whole wagon train for o2. It sounds like everyone needs to do some training to where you go into the enemy hostile kingdoms. That's fair. I just i was gonna wait until somebody else brought it up, but now the grace and has i'm like yes.

06:54

Here we go. And you know amiko can focus on that bud of power that she's felt growing in her chest in her blood. Yeah. Um, so that raises the question then since we're waiting on Abby. Anyways, so i would like to drop some of my ninja levels and turn them back into samurai levels.

07:15

I don't think there's a samurai around, unless we go back to the skeleton and turn to dust who is a higher level samurai than me to accommodate that. Uh, you can actually take lessons from 103. That's true. Yeah. That was about to suggest that yo this is oh a thousand year old katana.

07:37

Who knows literally everything about samurai. That's perfect. Are we at the town? You are near town. Yeah, that's that's changing. That question are, are we where we are on the map here? Is that where we are? Because we were at like here when we had the hill fight. I'm fairly sure.

08:01

We crossed the bridge. We crossed this bridge. Yeah. Yeah, you cross this bridge you were at jugging and we were we had sold in bought stuff. If i remember correctly and did our level up. Yes, yeah, which i realized i had to undo one of my reagent purchases, because i was bought stuffed to make a, to upgrade my belt of strength and i was like, over the week.

08:23

I was like, wait a minute, that's a leather thing. I can't make that. So i have switch that over and greyson is now going to be discreetly making his own shizuku of the night, wind hell yeah. Login is a neutral. Small town, go to population of 1370. This is back in the discord chat, right?

08:49

Yeah. Uh, yes. And we say elder. Sarai is a witch specializing in enchantment so i can get greater spell. Focus. Here she is a witch, so that's not you know unheard of

09:18

All right, so where's the formula for retraining defeat?

09:32

Hola.

09:40

Yeah. Okay, welcome. Welcome. So this is gonna be an in the ice training montage.

09:51

Okay. Okay, where everyone was kind of like uh i kind of want to do this thing. Yeah, i kind of want to do this thing and i'm just like you guys aren't really being rushed anymore, and everyone kind of has training they want to do before going into enemy territory.

10:13

Were you wanted to do a little sharpening up before we go to fight harder? Do you have any training or retraining? You would like to do just so i don't feel bad, i may cause also retraining. So we're racing grace. There's a month ago and then shoko you were like coyote is perfectly happy.

10:37

The way she is. She'll go where you're going to pick something up? Also, yep. I am training out six rounds of bardic performance because i bought, because levels of giving me more than enough already performance at this point uh, for a greater small focus. Ah,

11:10

Do we know how much time we want to spend doing this? Because i need like 30 days. Oh my god. Needs at least a month. Oh, i'll make it. Does need five weeks. Even would be better. Oh, shucka. Just needs five days. Uh, so showcas got a lot of free time on his hands.

11:29

Yeah, i need 20% synergy. Switch. At a minimum five skill points. And then another five days to switch the heat.

11:41

Assuming there is a master leather worker in this village. I don't actually know it. Uh yeah, there's there's definitely a master leather worker. You're retraining your master craftsman. I think he's doing even more than vital strike for another master craftsman for leather working. Um, so i have to actually get skill rings in that craft to actually get to that the Just because is even though technically vital strike does give, you know, a little extra damage on one attack.

12:22

It's just it's an extra 1d8 and that's it. So about that noticeable.

12:33

Yeah, by the strike, really works better. And when you're not able to pump out 15 hours, it's definitely not beneficial to you. Um but certainly other other builds that work, a lot better with it, so i'm at 15 days of training so i fit nicely inside. Grayson's window.

13:00

Oh, i'm sorry. That's if i have synergy. And i don't think samurai or ninja have symmetry with her synergy with each other.

13:22

They do not.

14:07

I don't want to load the features compendium. Okay. Did we ever find out a way to apply spell focus to an entire group of spells? No, you have to put it into as an effect note for your spells.

14:29

It's two conditional, unfortunately.

14:56

So i have a question when retraining it sounded like, you're basically doing that all the time. Or is it also possible to do crafting like in the morning and evening? Or is it if you can do crafting while you're adventuring? I imagine that. You can do crafting. The same rules would apply though, because most of your time retraining is taken up retraining, it's eight hours a day for a number of.

15:18

That's what it says you would. You would still use adventuring rules for crafting, the cut in half time. All of that. Okay, which i remember if remember is basically instead of doing a thousand gold today, it's 500 gold a day. Yeah, that sounds right and you can only get two hours of work done.

15:42

So then it would be 250, gold worth a day. It's quite a small amount. It is quite slow. That's all right. You get some stuff done. So, we're all doing this here in this town. I'm going to mark it and do it. I'm i'm doing it right on.

16:10

So just a double check myself, before i lose track of how much gold i have formula, is 10 times your level times the number of days required to perform the retraining. So 10 times 9, which is our level times the number of days. For the number of things that i'm doing correct.

16:37

Uh, sorry well. Sorry. Say that again times your level times the number of days required to do the retraining. Yes, that's correct. Okay.

16:59

Uchi your two crafting requests, the crackling tassel, and upgrading your your other item are both completed. Hell yeah.

17:16

And so, what is? I think grayson is the the person with the most. What is the total number of days? I'm going to put in a jacks. I'm trying to work it backwards for the recap on. Uh, i need 30, but i think sands just said five weeks. Yeah.

17:33

Like, yeah. What's uh, what's what's a mako's total time? Uh, 30. No one.

17:56

20 30. Yeah. 36.

18:02

No, i can't be right. I've already clicked the edit button 36. Yeah. Okay, i don't know why i didn't trust that math in my head. I had to put on my calculator.

18:28

Oh, i mean, if she's going another, you know, six more days, then i'll do another five days online, okay? So, oh, so if we're doing 35 days, you said that means 36 36 days. So, i have 31 days to uh, spend uh, i could spend 20 of those days.

18:51

Grabbing a new language perhaps knowing hongo could be useful. There are rules for gaining more languages, outside of linguistics.

19:07

Uh, yes spell. Retraining new language. Are you swapping one for? Like one of your older ones? No, it does not swap uh does not count towards your maximum number of languages. You could train this way. Only a number of times equal to one plus. Your intelligence bonus. So it's it's an additional language.

19:30

You can learn over your intelligence bonus. That's cool. Yeah.

19:38

Uh, oh, that is a lot. That's um, right now, that's uh,

19:51

It's nine time. So,

20:01

It's at 18 thousand.

20:09

No way. It's nine, nine time. Not okay. Oh oh gee. I can't do your second request. I don't know why this keeps because i don't quite know the the belt stuff yet. Okay. Like you don't have the requirements to craft it. Yeah. But, uh, so at the end of this 36 days, i will, i can't start making it starts on it.

20:34

That's fine. I don't, i was just curious. I was like, i'll take the money back. It's not doable though. I do need somebody in town who also speaks. The language also is hongol a language. A separate language from. Oh yeah. Okay, i would hope so. So sans, do you think it's two outlandish for me to find someone who speaks hong goal here and yaging?

21:01

Uh, no. Actually, that is fine. Hungle is, is a commonly spoken tongue here, uh and the common languages on this side of the peak are turning into, it's young.

21:24

No longer. Kelvin is the the norm of languages you are hearing.

21:39

Which t on is their version of common? If it's just young,

22:09

Well, i guess i should ask this, how long does a projected for us to, for our truck across hongold to take? Is it a? It's i imagine it's quite a big place if it's based off mongolia. Uh, it's it's an entire life country. Yeah, it's you gotta go through what trevosting a country in order to get so here.

22:35

And let me, i think i have a blank one with no spoilers on it. There's one with just country names. Yeah, yeah. There you go. So up there at the very very top, you'll see hungle in the forest of spirits. You're coming out about midway along the border line of hungle on the north.

23:04

So you'll be traveling through northern hungold following the mountains to the forest of spirits and then down into minkai. So you're only going to be in the hungle for a week, maybe or two. If you have bad weather and traveling, all right? Then maybe picking up the language isn't worth it.

23:26

Let's let me put it this way. What languages do you speak right now? And probably none that you don't. I have common tian verisian minkayan, sylvan and sansar.

23:49

Those are all excellent for this AP. I don't know what other ones i would recommend. I have too many of it is.

24:12

I assume ochi already speaks hungle, so even if we do need to do not. Oh, you don't. I don't right now. All right, then shuckle will pick it up. Just in case we do need it in our week, in mountain goal. Hate you points at night like the other half of her family.

24:37

Oh, you guys

24:52

A very attacked by young to apologist. Uh shoko looks very embarrassed to have made that mistake. Um, i'm um sorry. I should have remembered and tell you about that side of it. So, why would you now?

25:12

It's sorry. Who are you talking to me? Yeah, come in, bro. So how does it raining work? Now, do i just put 1800 on abby's character if you just give? No. I mean i am on my phone but it's just for a transcript to like take notes. Uh what's up dude?

25:32

You just hear it later. Hi. Well yeah pixel has like a really nice text to speech her speech to text the only reason i do it so i can make like a little recapy dealio. It's really cool. Actually, it's undertaking like application. That people who are really coding and creating like their little like repository for all their changes and stuff use and it's a, it's really neat.

26:01

What's the place called it does this oh, Girl Scout? Yeah. Come on, bro. You know i mean, i haven't really tapped into everything that it can do yet, but i keep track of spread our game and the upper reaches on the wall doesn't show you through to the top of pong gold.

26:20

I don't even know how to work it back yet anymore. Apparently i lost my main window but i have like the whole game so far in here, very cool. That's really fun. What the fuck? Oh well what's bro with the time to spare show go would express an interest in learning the languages.

26:40

See, i don't have any of the pages filled over, but also strict place, you can go and do we need text later? Fill in all the characters, maybe put maps and stuff in. It's really cool. Like it's like building my own business. Well, like i was having a hard time like keeping track but the shit that it happens so far at one point.

27:08

And i was like i need um a better way to keep notes. My thought process is by the time we actually die if we get the pleasure of actually, sure.

27:23

And he knows. Um, then she'll probably retrain out of the ninja rocket that she has book and then discover what coldness is about. But other than that like it doesn't really make sense. No, i got her ninja diploma off of amazon. Basically. Yeah, or it turned into diploma comes from studying about alchemy emulating from a teacher that was kind of asshole.

28:03

And then learning from a, i were talking soak. Mishmash of nonsense. Why her sneak attacks on like, oh precise neat. One strike. One kill. Now there's i recall half of your skin because it works. Is it neat? Is it poison? Is it effective? These are different things function over form.

28:35

Exactly, which is as i understand the idea behind the department.

28:45

All right, so yeah. No, i can have a 1800 gold.

28:54

What do i do with this?

29:00

Your donations are accepted. But why do i need? I, i don't, i don't understand it myself. It's just some the divine but you must you must compel me and over this money.

29:24

Not realistically, i think it would be done to. You're not getting people all of the i just constant or maybe it's like you don't just need someone who knows the language. But somebody who knows how to teach languages. Yeah, almost certainly

29:51

And also down to the fact that you probably be trying to use it in actual conversation, especially for the town, where it gets used because nothing. Anybody says can convince me that noise accent for for hamla aggressively bad? She would definitely be able to read it, much better than speak it.

30:39

Me and everyone is all done. I am close. We could probably move on with our lives. I just need to change some. No, i, i still have a couple of things to do on. I might go to as well. So,

30:56

If i get something at first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth. My brain is not powerful enough to come up with a formula to do that. What would you do it of doing like at classes samurai? Arch level. Divided by two floor. Does that sound right floor. Open parentheses, but as to the correct multiplier, like i already, i'm copying it from my.

31:24

Um, my samurai bonus damage for half my level. That's applies 13579, right? I'm not doing the math throwing there. The way the paiso words. It doesn't make it. Bad friendly for my brain. All right, sorry, what what? Exactly is the feature you doing so much resolve? I'm trying to get the charges to just populate straight from my level because i had them in manually is only having two this whole time per day.

31:51

Yeah. Okay. And so you get it at first level and then every other level, every one additional time per day for every two samurai levels beyond first. So that's effectively just half your level floored, right?

32:13

Just put an ant in there at the beginning of classes.

32:20

Yeah, it's right now. I have parentheses floor parentheses at classes.s samurai, arch.level, slash two parenthesis parentheses. I think, that's right. I've typed it in them one, if it's roughly about menu. Hey, what was the other one? I was worried about challenge. We need to go change challenge.

33:19

Man, i wish i could learn to be fluent and language in 20 days. Magic and gotta explain shit. It's probably what you're anything.

33:38

Would that be that formula plus one for resolve because you get the one at first level one plus four. Yeah. Okay, because i have that on challenge, it looks like i built that correctly when i first set this up but i did not do that on resolve 1 plus 4, over parentheses at classes summary, level divided by 2 close parentheses.

33:59

Put that whole thing and in parenthesis and you should get those. All you need. Are your total pool? Yes, it looks right now. Okay. Praise jebus. Praise log.

34:28

So about how useful on average as as somebody who grew up for about 17 years in the, the team, on the tien continent. Um, how useful on average does knowing the regional dialects come in handy like like is minkai in the common language. Pretty much saturated all over the continent at this point or, or the end is the common sorry, tn tn.

35:03

I got my turns mixed up. Um, but it's it's just like an abstain where it's common is the common tongue spoken across, almost all of the realms. And then you have well acceptance holder where it's held in, is just the tongue, but then in versa, you have varician and common, they're just they're different dialects.

35:25

Every kind most countries have their own dialect and or entirely different language from the common tongue. I think there's no different. Christian is predominantly more Thessalonians. Yeah, didn't tell them but yes also has different giant. I think indeed or joton as they've officially called it in second bed. Uh, so mincayen is one of the regional dialects of tion.

35:55

Young shoe, uh and then there's Goka on the other side. We'll be going there later. Yes. So there there's way. Well, if we run through the ruby phoenix oh i'll have to look up two E bars. All right, so i know. Sorry. Go ahead, so they're they're playing dialects.

36:24

You can learn in. In tian, you'll get respect from locals, if you speak to them in their regional time. Okay.

36:42

It's it's very much the same, as like being in europe. Yeah, you have french german Italian spanish. If you're talking in a business sense, though, for some extent, there is an expectation that a lot of them will speak. English is the as the front of libra, the business language.

37:08

But if you speak to them language, you'll typically be like, oh, you are a personal culture person of culture, or if you're french, you'll just not be incident anymore. Um or you will, depending on how good they're accent is. Yeah, my experience and speaking with French people in France, just don't try

37:35

I know if you were, i know a few qubit qual folk, and they said they have never had a dirtier look levy to them than when they tried to speak quibble off French with actual French people. Yep.

37:55

It's it's really disappointing. You get a similar thing in germany as well, but they they mean it in a very in a very nice way because you speak to them in german and then they really is very quickly. The German is not your first language. So they switched a question and they're like, oh yeah we get to, we get the practice and they speak it better than you and have an argument about that.

38:15

But, yes, generally church Belen was very much, a lot about having lived in. America believe me. Most Germans speak english better than americans. Oh no. That i can believe. Yes, definitely. Um back though, i just thought to kencha um common is still useful like no very much pelvin is still very useful especially if you decide that you want to go through amananda because that's but just elbow.

38:53

It's just a thousand colonies. So you know they're in Thailand is the main language and say, oh no is amazon still there in in modern day. Two week continuity? No reason for it to have gone anyone. So it is currently but we're waiting for the for them to actually do a book on it, but i suspect it won't be about far off.

39:20

We'll probably get either an arcadia or our calzimarron book first. I think wait what wasn't one of those continents like established by like change jacobs himself to be like, we're never doing anything here. This continent is for players to home brew on.

39:43

Well it can't be arcadia. Um, thousand moron, they've added some substantial stuff. About what comes from plasma around in the impossible, kingdoms book. So a bit of a crap too, i can imagine them being like that with arcadia, just some expense get. The problem is that there is a lot of pre-existing information about arcadia.

40:05

And they've literally printed a ton of stuff, um, about like, what's over there. Uh, i'm culturally how how it kind of works. So i make them so i'm familiar somewhat with the the general story and tiong jaw is so far as the like the main country used to roll all of it in like a big emperor, like the china stand in and like that recently fractioned up into pieces.

40:38

And that's the world we're looking at now essentially. Yeah, we're we're not quite in in like the the romance era of china. But this is very much like post song dynasty dissolvement a couple thousand years ago, which one is the the big original emperor empire. Good question. It means the one that fell or the one like older.

41:15

Well originally it was imperial Longoire. Yes. The big can shoot that footstanding for. Oh, she has done. Also, i believe, by the way.

41:31

But i think that was another one. It would be using yes. Because Eugene is is the imperial calendar. So yeah, so the ushing was the first empire. Um, well before, uh, absolent marketing, like 200500 years before that and then a thousand or so years later. It basically don't humbled into the ground.

42:04

Um split collapsed and then like a thousand years after that rose and then long while I hadn't providing and thought the bookshirt and then that it did the china dynasty thing where it just fractured itself.

42:27

I love the dragon out pretty good. They're so sick. Yeah. Who isn't done? Did he and you finished, right? Okay, you got your stuff. I got my stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Um put on the magic harp song already this montage, real quick. No, not again, it looks like poly is like what's left imperial wall?

42:53

Like that used to be the center of them. The continent.

43:02

All right, so There is my book. So i would love the flavor of this to be that he asked, hey, no sui to like sharpen his skills and a mako who's, like, not even a palette anymore. And is like, doing i, she is still a third level palette, and actually, she's doing sparkly finger stuff, and still beating my ass with teeno sui while i'm trying to learn how to fight with the katana.

43:34

Like i was fighting with my short swords. My walkie's ashes. It's also koya, instructing her, how to control her magic that she's rapidly learning. I don't know. I don't know how much help shoko can be as a fellow innate charisma caster. You can you can certainly help her learn to control it as a charisma caster.

44:02

I koya is helping her control it via varician tattoos. Ah,

44:13

And it's just tattooing her in the ice cold snow, well send no, three instructs, the both of you in the ways of rule and sword. Burial. Like she's gonna be an imperious Bloodline sorcerer, i will be right back. I need to go find another vape because i'm not a vape and our arcanus leaving us in the very middle of the adventure is less of a detriment now.

44:42

Oh, okay. That makes sense. My next question was gonna be. Why that? That tricks because she was originally a barred and then we had shoko and, you know, she had a little crisis of conscience and they were like, bubba, go do this 10. No, sui paladin, malaria. Frontliners too double.

45:07

Barded it. If you can't stack inspired courage you you would just be literally any other kind of love them and not thick inspire card. I didn't really think about that back then. She had an identity crisis and now she's found her path. You did say at the beginning of this, that every single character is like like h.

45:36

Npc is sort of blank slate e like they they have a bunch of different paths. They can go down. I'm kind of they give. Yeah, they they give they develop, you have helped them develop along the lines. There were some suggestions in the very first book about how to level them if needed.

46:00

But primarily to focus on the ones that you guys end up focusing on and everyone loved coya. So, quiet is always around and let me goes the princess. I hate that i've never used my my campaign trade require because i never had a chance. I can never fit a cure spell on my ball on my on the casting mustard.

46:27

Which does remind me. I need look one.

46:37

Because some of you are actually high enough. Now, to get thing a little bit.

46:51

Beer piso. Why did you never print to action? Why did you never do that?

47:02

That's a good question games like one cool trait, right? Right that like feeds into that. Okay. All of the npc buffs are in book one.

47:21

On time because of course they are. Why would you not just put it in an index in the back of each book? Because publishing they like to do that later.

47:40

Oh, i actually can't remember, you can't take like rogue archetypes. That tried out things that you don't lose as a mentor, right? Like you can't do that. I'm pretty sure not technically. But what are you thinking? I don't know. I'm just spreading horizons and trying to find things. That might be cool.

48:02

It's i don't i don't need powerful. I just need cools. And if we can, if we can adapt something to work seamlessly, i don't mind. Oh, i forgot. I bought my cool hat. All right. Cool hat. Cool hat. No way. And grayson have both earned the devotion boon for sure.

48:33

Lelu.

48:38

I don't know how uh you don't bugger, you have never spoken a single word to her and you have efficiently. Done your job actually. Neither have i i don't think i have anyways.

48:56

I'm sure OT has talked to every single person,

49:03

During the undead battle. No, like except my affinity to zero. Uh, your your kill count is just not. Not quite there yet. You're a good tank. You're a good tank. That not so much closer yet. Okay, so that boon was something. You told me i had back in book one so i'm assuming it doesn't change for me though.

49:30

No, you yeah, yeah. Actually, you are getting really early too. Now, she was my the one. I like my background. Yes, stuff was worth.

49:45

Uh thumbs up ochi, you have sandwich devotion Boone, you have that on your sheet yet. No. Okay. Anything. So,

50:03

Everyone's got koias.

50:09

And actually, you guys should have had koya as much. Much earlier on. Yo, sandrus Boone is perfect. It's pretty great.

50:26

Where are the bones? I'm dropping them in discord.

50:38

Uh, and he is at 3.

50:54

It looks like everyone would be between 30 and 34. So yeah potions from 300 to 350 gold. Basically, she will just make for you if you ask her. Portions between uh potions with a cost of 300 to 350 gold and under you will make for you for free. Fantastic.

51:20

Thank you. She gives you base to help. Yeah, every game session now, koya will provide each of you. A number of new potions of your choice with a total gp value equal to your relationship score times 10.

51:36

How can one person be so unbelievably. Nice. I mean they made her to be the loving grandma. Everyone always wanted.

51:54

Yeah.

52:19

And,

52:24

Gonna have to change what this is called a little. Why did i jump down to visions of Jade?

52:34

Boom. Christen you gave her that gift. Oh, she loved that. Right. Okay, so everyone's got amigos too, which i have to change slightly.

53:10

Transforming it.

53:20

Okay, who gets some who gets way ends devotion, boo. Just a mako. Sadly. Um, how should we flavor? Theo leaving imagining that he put a fireball than his fury too close to himself finally instead of the rest of the party and just exploded himself in that fight on the hill.

53:47

Uh, actually, yeah, the undead battle on the hill is probably where he met his end. It's really i terrible way to go.

54:01

He got run up on by three mammoths and then exploded himself and all of them a Marta Ferrara sparkles. I will always remember him but not why he comes up.

54:20

Or his surname or is race or what he looks like and you all get that for three rounds right now.

54:30

Yo.

54:37

It's pretty lit. Oh damn. Yeah, that is really good. He died. Zero died on porn island. On what? Oh my god. It is. It is porn island. What somebody wrote an r between the o and the n. That's okay. I was wondering if anyone would say anything. Yeah. Okay, sad, man.

55:16

I am a child. You think that happened?

55:31

All right, so everyone looking good i believe so i'm sure i'll find out something. I miss later.

55:40

I've still got all the stuff. Um, figure it out. Well, i can turn all of these into bubs in game for you guys to put onto your character sheets. You want probably where i should have put this?

55:57

Yeah, i think i'm good. I will, i will not be swapping out a spell to make up for the loss of our artist. I will rely on omeco's newfound abilities.

56:13

I was thinking of taking the drum spell for it morioe

56:21

It is a good one but maintain it. Take it.

56:37

Now, yeah, okay, okay, yeah, i'll take it. You have convinced me that i mean, took so much effort. What? What thing are you? Uh, i did have a stage fright as a spell for what i took for my third level spell uh, because the synergizes with both large bar and the enchantment focus.

57:05

About that. I was also looking at thundering drums for the flavor, when, as well as we, we need more aoe because we just lost our fireball, man.

57:32

Older mirror. This is thundering drums.

57:50

Okay, i wasn't gonna do this that you. You guys have done a bunch of retracting stuff. I'm gonna retrain exactly one thing.

58:00

What's the rules? I'm retraining our feet, uh, seven days. If you don't have synergy five days if you do. Oh no, that's for class levels. I'm so sorry, it takes five days for a feet. Okay. Well, i'm not going to be able to change poison activation timing anyway and any great to talk to logical.

58:23

So i can change that off but i can pick up this really stupid. Tracking said have so many coupons, i really probably just get this

58:36

So i'd have to, i have to ask a question which is a loaded question. Um, okay. Is the emotatsues or minkai or anything that we've come across aligned with any kind of imperial dragon. Uh, yes. Which one minka is. There's a thought sovereign, that is perfect. That's sick. That was i mean i was i really should have.

59:14

It should have been kind of obvious but thank you for asking. I've got to ask, i've got to ask because yeah, iomaday has her gold dragon. She zero has her her sovereign dragons.

59:33

Talking with way out about like sukio and Kazir in the background is like i have an idea. This is a terrible idea. We're doing it anyway. I'm glad i could inspire you, you may regret that but we'll see because now i have to do that. I'm not gonna regret it.

59:53

Someone else is gonna regret it. Yeah, pretty much.

01:00:05

Diagram. Hopefully, this should be quick for me to put together, so i can do this while everything else is going on.

01:00:14

Sonic damage. Yeah, it's a it's i hope it's useful. The 15 foot is a little but that would be a totally custom buff, grayson

01:00:34

Yeah, we had talked about in the past as something he was thinking or oh it was going to do, but i didn't know that. I talked about thank the super busy. I am making adjustment. So, what do you need? We talked about a diversify for kelda. I did not make one yet but you definitely get one.

01:01:01

I told me, i'm gonna make a note right now on the sticky pad to come up with one for her. Thank you. I completely forgot.

01:01:15

Stinky bad.

01:01:25

I will have that before next game session. Okay. Yeah it's about super important. It was just some weird dimensions in the past as a possibility. Yeah no like i'll get you. I got you.

01:01:57

And,

01:02:01

And be stacking. Dodge bonuses.

01:02:07

Well, they stack.

01:02:12

Oh, okay. If only in another life you were in aldori, sword manager, if only

01:02:28

I just need to make that sweet sweet flavor, uh shift to minkai and sword. Lord and change the first feet. Prerequisite to weapon focused katana? I mean, i'm surprised. There isn't something like that. Actually, you totally could do it if you wanted to, but i wanted to stick with real classes.

01:02:54

Since this is my first time,

01:03:11

So what was this about a polar mirage?

01:03:18

Yeah. So one evening, you find yourself watching a very beautiful aurora borealis.

01:03:32

Uh and the caravan drivers kind of divert off course briefly, uh, but they, they eventually make their way back on track, you know, they start following the mirage's that are created. And finally everyone, you know, camps for a little bit until it passes.

01:04:13

And where did it go?

01:04:27

For some reason, the caravan has been moved to the battle maps folder. Well, a lot of battle happens there to be fair. Magnate is no longer with you. He left without saying goodbye battens. Several of your waters. Okay. Filtering, never wanted to see you again. I wanted his devotion about you were never gonna get it.

01:05:03

Truth.

01:05:08

You have finished your training and the wall of heaven is in sight and by insight, i mean, it's, you know, within like a hundred miles so you can actually see the peaks of the, the walls of heaven and

01:05:27

Not anymore. No.

01:05:47

And why don't you have travel above?

01:06:14

Oh, okay. I misunderstood this.

01:06:24

That makes way more than let's go back over here. Vibration ice maps.

01:06:54

Is terrible, man. Yeah. Thankfully, this will be the last time we ever have to use this map and i have a much better way of extracting them. Now, i the caravans stops after it almost plummets into a crevasse after following some northern lights and missed.

01:07:29

Why aren't you like okay? Oh, no way.

01:07:39

Grace in.

01:07:47

Coco that everyone.

01:07:58

Uchi initiative. I'm sorry. But no, just saying you're not initiative, i'm trying to build the thing that you made for me, Grayson because i can't find it anywhere. I'm here. Now, it looks like it might be initiative. Considering we have a battle map. This is an rp map obviously.

01:08:21

Yes, it's just for a one acrobatic skill to jump across. That's it. All right. Yep, just one. One roll? No, no, it's not. I mean, acrobatics checks have never gone wrong for us and started multiple encounters at the same time. God. Never never know, and then i'm going to get it.

01:09:00

Actually. Abby, you said you had a way to get rid of these extra buff to like icons that seem to keep playing Grayson saying, what was it? That's so it's a macro. Um, let me see if i can. I'm sorry. Uh, come on.

01:09:25

Okay.

01:09:31

We do not have inspire couragement.

01:09:39

Of the black slush. Debuff on my sheet. There aren't any like long-term side effects from that were there. There were not you can probably delete that. Yeah.

01:10:09

Now, i'll have to take it out, but, yeah, there's definitely a specific command called clear all of yours that are associated with the problem. So because i had to do it and one of the other games, okay? If you ever have time to do it in such, it would be greatly appreciated.

01:10:25

Yeah, the size cost active confusion before for us. Yeah, i want to get it anyway into kind of habit as a separate macaron. Just yeah, keep it.

01:10:52

Didn't know, i end up following some of the neurotoxin whichever use that or anything.

01:11:02

Still got it.

01:11:10

Did we ever establish what it was like, what? Like, was it just magical poison, or like did it come from like a plant or for like creature or I know. I'm not entirely sure.

01:11:34

There's no way carving around a vial of radioactive snow right now. I would have actually is yes. Well, you don't have a head full of that, good.

01:11:51

Oonly strains wine. Look back, do things disappear?

01:11:59

What is happening with a poking thing?

01:12:09

Okay, select them all at once.

01:12:30

Well, and as you approach the crevice, the northern light, then turned angry and red.

01:12:46

And we're about to kick our butts, all the laid back to her asia.

01:13:04

I am self-rolling. There we go.

01:13:10

Why?

01:13:18

Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.

01:13:40

Actually think he missed.

01:13:51

Yes.

01:13:58

So how did? Oh wait, never mind. I know exactly what they got this box. Louis. Yeah, yeah. Invisibility. Yeah. Yeah, with perfect life scene. So they leave no tracks in the snow.

01:14:20

Uh, and you can kind of see as the, the northern lights uh, turn brighter and darker and angrier. All once the broken remains of caravans down in the crevasse

01:14:38

Oh, Grayson licks his lips and it's like, yeah my my loot senses jingling.

01:14:50

Lifted loot for here. So i can feel my stuff. That's right. As i roll twice, i would like to keep a 25 if i could. I don't know why it will. Everyone is rolling initiative twice. Hold on, hold on. I think it's because i'll wait to click the button where there's copies of us on the same map, as what's happening.

01:15:14

Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:26

They're more copies of you. It doesn't look like okay. Uh even though i would love to take that second role, my first row was lower. I just don't know how to alter it in the initiative list. I well actually the ones that have your tokens on them are the ones who are still on the map.

01:15:53

The other tokens were on the mountain.

01:16:06

Great thing. Oh, great question. Why do you have so much damage? The one from the willow was, right? Right.

01:16:18

Uh, so yeah, those are all obviously, get your platformity 500 touches. I should say as they are a touch attacks. When should be full health? No. When should be will help at this moment. In times, he he is super suffering. Emotional damage at this point in time. Uh, way in also needs to have more hit points than that.

01:16:46

Holy shit. I rolled a 20 on initiative and i'm second last. Uh, willowess are very fast.

01:16:58

Oh my gosh, amigos initiative is great. It's because she took improved initiative and imagine why. Because it was a bloodline beat. Be speedy. Exactly exactly. Be speaking. Um, of a bone, you take your six points of damage that way. Uh, i should have. I don't know if it went through this, i mean, and your 13 ochi marijuana.

01:17:32

Your 13 points is image.

01:17:38

13. What? Ac was it against your flat footed? Touch. Oh, 500 touch. What is that? Then not good. You are a nimble. Chap. It is not great. I did not take it or weird 100% certain on that. Um, let me see. I mean, my touch is 21 and my flat photo is 24, but your flat footed touch and all of your decks removed.

01:18:16

So six, including your dodge bonuses. So yeah, probably yeah. Dancers graze dodge feet and a dexter 5. Yeah, they they hit you with anything.

01:18:34

Bubba. Boom. That was his turn though. Um, i may go actually already had knowledge Arkana so that doesn't really change.

01:18:51

Wait, are they knowledge? Sharcona.

01:18:56

They are error. Element will now, aren't they? But that knowledge the planes. Yeah, they're outside of jail. If they're still aberr.

01:19:11

Then.

01:19:20

Nope, small operations. Air, some reason that didn't transfer over with the spc, he does not have engineering. Also dunge engineering. Oh sorry. Engineering. All right shooko. You are quite familiar with willowiths. Every chapter in bug farmer, living near marshaller. Swamps has his own name for these faintly glowing. Balls of light juggal lanterns corpse candles, walking fires, fine, lights, spook lights, rush lights, but all recognize them as dangerous creditors and false guides in the darkness evil creatures that feed on the strong psychic combinations of terrified creatures.

01:20:01

They delight in the tempting gullible, travelers since the dangerous situations and the wildlands were their most common willowest. Favorite simple tactics like positioning themselves over clips or quicksand where they can easily even mistaken for lanterns. Especially if they can sit their traps near actual signal lanterns, allowing them to lure, lure unwary travelers into perilous situations.

01:20:23

Uh they are naturally immune to all magic except magic missile and the maze spell for some reason.

01:20:34

They feed on fear anytime they're within 15 feet of a dying creature or a creature subject to a fear effect. It gains fast. Healing 5 and natural invisibility. They can extinguish their lights at will, or as a move action and become invisible as per the spell. But when they fire off their little shockies, again they become visible because like the glow up

01:21:06

Hell. Yeah, they also have a very powerful touch attack that does electricity damage as you clean.

01:21:23

Um, yeah, yeah. Oh i just looked at the attacks. You guys just ate uh oh wow. Okay. Uh,

01:21:38

Good job on taking those guys are guys. Are champs. You share any of that information with that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, um. What was the part of was there anything about like any attacks that won't hurt them. Um, all magic but magic missile and maze.

01:22:02

They are immune to ah yeah. Yeah, unless someone has magic missile or maze uh your ear you're not you're not gonna hurt these things. Stab no work. Have those work comes back. Static stop one.

01:22:33

So amigo unleasheses, the flurry of green and gold orbs Doesn't have arcane spell failure because armor training, green and gold. Orbs. Yep. Yo with a whistle almost like, jade and gold. Yeah.

01:22:58

Uh, the cackles and becomes invisible as a move action.

01:23:09

I put.

01:23:22

No way. I love and hate willowess. I, i'm not there their biggest fan. Honestly you fight just like them. But no, no, i'm not the biggest fan. They they take my shit. Um, yeah, five, footstep. Since we we know, okay, you're still threatening with your legs, right? He also threatens with his boat now, too.

01:23:50

You, you have the, the uh class feature. Yeah, gives it to just it's a five written but yeah. Yeah. Snap is not basically yeah. Very nice. Yeah. All right. All right, let's see if i ought to correct number of attacks. This time, knowing me. Probably not.

01:24:19

We're just.

01:24:38

All right, my next question is i have a new module installed, all right, is this popping up character art for you guys? Can you see on mouseover? Yeah. Yes i can it is but it it was already popping it up of the previously too. Uh it's popping it up on both sides now for me.

01:25:03

Yeah their previously was one next to the chat. On the right where the combat tracker. Hangs out with like a border and all that and no name and stuff. But now it also puts it on the left.

01:25:19

Really won't both of them going opportunity to screenshot. You would like, no, i i follow.

01:25:32

I won't say i prefer the left one without the border and everything. It's kind of neat. No way. Oh my god. Hey, so your butts doesn't even matter because you're too, attacked murderer. That willow is.

01:25:53

And then,

01:26:02

You vanish made him invisible after the block after the hit. Just like it's light goes dim and it becomes visible.

01:26:16

Oh, you're lucky. I was gonna have a good description of grace and pulling back his bow. Ready to to let loose on this. Whisp between us this very insubstantial whisk with the zeros point of directly at no way through it.

01:26:33

Take a look a little less excited about doing that. If you could grab some,

01:26:42

Yes, that is a. That is my entire time.

01:26:48

Look, i saw a chance for flanking and i took it. Grayson, uh, yeah, crystal just let loose set the the other one. That's right. Nearby, that he's got selected.

01:27:06

Boom. Boom.

01:27:18

One takes 22 and then really ah there we go.

01:27:29

I'm not going back to this. It's like of them like a five foot seven and fades away. Ochi. Ochi going stab? I don't even think i'm gonna move. I think i'm just gonna stab.

01:28:01

Go. Super well about 14 all the great role and he already acted. So neither of those hit, unfortunately. All right, p the notes. You will growl at him.

01:28:28

Tackles in the light at you. Is it evil? Yes. Extraordinarily. Okay, that's my turn. Boom, boom. I'm koya. And this is how i roll.

01:28:55

Since for healing or damaging, we're healing.

01:29:06

The two sugar. Ah,

01:29:17

Choco.

01:29:25

Trucko takes out, um,

01:29:31

Do i have a way to see invisibility? Y'all probably not. Did we maybe something in like the and our loot list in our potions and scrolls, we're carrying No, doesn't look like it. Didn't you buy a wand of dairy fire? But i, yes. And that's what i'm going to use here.

01:29:55

But that only helps once i know about the ones that are already visible. Uh, so i'm gonna put a five foot burst here and hit this guy and any that happened to be in those three squares, which might not be any probably not. Any. But struggle is going to keep that out or what, our assumedly, more of these things finding and waiting for us.

01:30:22

Well. All right, then.

01:30:33

Oh wait. They don't they aren't affected by magic, are they? They're not.

01:30:43

How did i? I'm so fucking stupid.

01:30:50

You get used to using magic on everything and then you're just like i knew better than that.

01:30:58

It's okay.

01:31:10

Any verb, 35 teacher touching for you.

01:31:22

He continues cackling in your face and then shoot you with more lightning delightful. Isn't it just though? O g goes.

01:31:43

Is that like a supernatural ability? I don't get to swing on him for doing lightning in my face. No, it's just a touch tag.

01:31:57

Depressive a little bit. I know. No way. Depresso expresso.

01:32:08

He forgot to become invisible. He's having so much fun. You about to have a bad time, huh?

01:32:22

You about to have a bad time.

01:32:36

I i assumed at it it did in fact hit they have no way of detecting other invisible creatures weirdly enough and that is enough to finish him off.

01:32:53

I did not like those.

01:33:03

I'm about done with dead, looking things and dead being things. Just gonna put that one out there.

01:33:21

No, we are. There's here. Six.

01:33:38

What you want to help me climb down into that crevice. There. Absolutely. I can, uh, gives you a rope going. Yeah, great.

01:33:53

It looks like we're gonna make an effort to climb down and look through the wreckage, a son of a bitch. All right. What did you does? Is that? No good. Know your your random loot is fine. Don't you worry about it.

01:34:26

He clearly murdered several mages and gem merchants. Oh my god. The amount of hot gemstones that we find, i know frosting. I'm beginning to think that there were actually like gem buying too. Once upon a time you a master excite who she want to be a safe wielder. No, we're not.

01:34:54

I'm not doing any more retraining.

01:34:59

Among us, was it that lights having major armor? Yes. Uh it was previously ochi and Grayson, but grayson will be getting reduced effect from it, because he finished uh his own shizuku of the night wind which gives and maybe ochi would still use it. Would you have like a wand?

01:35:24

I'm okay for you fucking wander. Major armor. Yeah, we just found a blonde image armor. I see, i mean yeah. I think i have a rank in UMD. Uh, well, i could even care. You you need quite a bit more than one ranking you in ddios and every time i took it off because i lost so many skill.

01:35:45

Ranks going back to samurai necessarily true. You just need to hit a bc 20. Just need to whack it a few times. Yeah, you have to, oh, will carry the wand of mage armor with him. And uh, whenever we're in hostel, whenever it looks like hostilities are about to.

01:36:02

I mean every day, cast it on koya. It's, it's a wand.

01:36:13

Yeah, yeah, i'll just cast it on ochie every day. Starting tomorrow. So we'll just it's it's a one. Well i got it. Yeah, only last an hour.

01:36:27

Video was casting major armor on them every day. He wasn't, he was an eighth level caster. Yeah. All right. Well, i will we will try and look out for combat and maybe i can breathe about you before we get it into it. Uh, all right. What else do we have for wands?

01:36:47

Um,

01:36:55

A wand of ray of front which probably just sell that potential for. Yeah. The others all that works. It I think i like to think Grayson has like an extra bag that he carries around. That's like a, i don't know what it's called, but your bag for golf clubs that's got all the little separators in it.

01:37:16

And he's like these wands, these gems and like, has it all pre-sorted. So that when he rolls into town, just go sell it all immediately and efficiently.

01:37:33

Be handy. Yeah.

01:37:39

And OG will walk up to weigh in. Oh never mind. And he'll be like, i grow very tired of this cold and horrible place. Could you please heal me. You go to weigh-in? Yeah. Uh, sure kind of lick. The dameko provides pipe best i can do, but I it's actually not the best you can do.

01:38:15

I'm just, he says hero. She hit this. Reloading bring another quick.

01:38:47

Let me push the button.

01:39:04

We go.

01:39:28

Which the wrong one. Why are you still on there?

01:39:44

The way in kind of taps out the pipe and touches you, we're six points of feeling perfect.

01:39:56

Thank you fucked quite ago.

01:40:11

01:40:39

Hold you. I mean, use this.

01:41:38

Him. Not sure how to later. Have we looking at racing? Oh, wet for the loot list. Yeah, there was a lot. I just threw at you. They're one picked stuff they want from it. Think the only person who took anything. Was that one of major armor, okay?

01:42:08

Uh, no still typing in hoard number three, but almost there. All right, well this next part is exposition, anyways. Go.

01:42:33

The last path as you approach. The elton zood also known as the last past. The temperature steadily drops, and ominous storm clouds dominate. The southern horizon as the caravan of sense towards the past. You see clearly storm clouds racing overheads swifter than the wind and you hear a fell feminine laughter mocking you from the clouds.

01:42:58

Interspersed with peels of thunder, the mountain. Peaks ahead are swallowed up in a roiling. Blizzard is avalanches begin to cascade down the mountain face to block the paths. Not again, the whole fury of the more zuko morelsco has been unleashed. The blizzard's fury seems restricted to the past itself for the moment at least, but if you remain in the open, the hungry storm will likely engulf you in turn.

01:43:39

The other everyone on the caravan page. Oh there. Another way around, or

01:43:56

Your guide. We can make for the eritake town of get scareled. It's 200 miles to the east and from there. We can try crossing the gulf of corky or at least taking shelter in the dwarven, delves on this side of the mountain, but i don't think the caravan can outrun that storm.

01:44:25

And they loo are there any other passes? We might go through. No, it says, oh.

01:44:45

Roko looks up at the storm. Was there any? What do we know about this? Is there any way like they're alive? Right? Like they're sapien is there any way we could commune with it or like to find out what's causing it? I think she's causing it.

01:45:13

Is, i may go. Koya, looks very uncomfortable.

01:45:23

So we're spirit haunts us and is called the spirit, the stormed block our way. Is that what you're saying? That would be my guess but i can't say i've ever encountered something like this. Can i make a knowledge religion. Check considering like undead are my thing to like think of a way that we might be able to get rid of her for good.

01:45:55

Well far, as you tell something like her being part of a living storm has never happened before for undead. Uh, your best bet would be finding where she's anchored herself and destroying her or remains of her soul.

01:46:27

So we found her wherever she's been anchored, but it seems to be in a living storm.

01:46:39

Well, then the answer is clear. We just have to kill the store. How do you kill us storm? Well, you know, shoot arrows at it. I, i don't think.

01:46:59

I was going to say, i don't think that'll work but knowing how well Grayson's done so far. It might just No, i could backstab it or something. I don't know. There is another way both walkers. I should draw on nodding seriously. Oh yeah, looks even more uncomfortable. As she speaks up, there's another path we can take.

01:47:31

And what is that? We cannot go over the mountains, we can go under it, we can take the gates of desna.

01:47:46

Following the path of spirits? No, no, no, no. I've seen this movie. We lose koya. If we go under the mountain, I'm so glad someone picked it up. This i did not make this up this fucking straight out of the fucking goddamn book. Where are you saying? There was a reference coming up, is this?

01:48:06

Yeah, reference the reference. I i i'm i'm uncultured. What is the reference? This is a straight. Lord of the rings. Fellowship of the rain, going through the minds of Moria where there's a storm blocking the paths. We can't go over. We have to go under and then the oldest person dies.

01:48:24

Yeah. Even like at that notion even know, is kind of like one wakazaki gets put back in its cheat. The other one stares out and she's like, it's an idea. Um, what are the gates of desma? No, a long time ago. The tall. Yeah, where to go.

01:49:01

Uh, here we go. The otalklands hundred nomads, who worshiped asthma as the queen of the north star. Their guidance protector in the long arctic night. You call believe that souls thought to follow the north star, even in death. And through years, they excavated of subterranean. Necropolis within caverns, the feet of the wall of heaven about 30 miles west of the last pass,

01:49:40

Big hole. They carved a passage called the path of spirits for the souls of the dead to make their way onto the high ice to follow the north star, to the top of the world where it doesn't know would carry them home into the stars.

01:49:58

I had a dream about it a few nights ago. I didn't know what it meant until now.

01:50:07

That seems as close to divine intervention. As you could say, that doesn't intervene meanwhile doesn't know. Yo, he never purposely intervenes. So like, here are some info dude. Like super important to your party. Don't get lost. No, good luck. You can do it. It's not only my mental image of bezen, i just like yeah.

01:50:47

And then she just like back flipped out a window holding a pie. Exactly that she stole from your fridge. Without you realizing the idea of Desmond, just being an elderly abomination, with a form that you are comfortable. With is one that i adore. But the idea of her doing that while also being an indiscriminate, just memelled far from there.

01:51:11

My jokes aside though. So what you're telling us is that we have a root that potentially could lead through the wall of heaven without getting ourselves. Learned about indicates vaguely to the sky. I don't know what's in the necropolis anymore. This was a long time ago. Well, the wooden acropolis is an indication.

01:51:41

Probably something dead. Probably many. We can probably stop and shoot those, right? Here. Oh shoot. Whatever you need me to be in a storm or a dead or underground things.

01:52:05

Um, as it happens, sugar is an expert on matters of spiritual shenanigans. When it comes to the to the dirtiness, right? Well, i

01:52:23

Spirits have always seem to bond to my presence in always. So, uh, maybe

01:52:41

Don't really know if i'd say. They like me. Or i'm like they or like maybe they're like allergic to me or something. It's always been weird.

01:52:58

On the one hand, you've been given some divine direction. And on the other we don't currently have a direction to go in. So, Well, where, where is the map? Uh,

01:53:16

Figure out what we're going and we just go around murkwood. Yes. Uh, this is where the last pass is. This is where the gates does. Not are or we could try charting a boat up through here.

01:53:37

In the middle of winter. No, that's all frozen over. Then we could walk.

01:53:46

You cannot okay, i'm just letting you know. Right now there's there's nothing over there.

01:53:59

Or the storm moves to block your path. It's the living storm. Yeah. Uh,

01:54:15

You're being pigeonholed by the sorry. I get it. It's shitty with is where you're going. Oh okay. Yeah. Yeah, i know if i i didn't want you to just straight up come out and really like say that, it was our only. Well, i guess i did. Kind of want you to say, it was our only option.

01:54:34

Yeah, that was the only thing i was testing about was like, i didn't know if this was another multiple, multiple choice, answer? No, they added in a hex, crawl. That was not sandbox format. Uh, which means once again, it was an unnecessary hex. Crawl in a game that we streamlined a great deal by having me just hand wave.

01:55:02

All the caravan encounters off to the side which deserve that frankly. Boom.

01:55:13

You guys make your way down the mountainside.

01:55:22

I really wish they had gotten someone to do art of this because the description of it is beautiful.

01:55:33

Good news is we don't have to go to caster light that isn't that good news? I do not want to have a conversation with my grandfather. We're not doing that please don't. Let's see. And over the bomb, the gates of desna are named for this great statues of the goddess.

01:56:00

That flank the entrance to the crop of us, between two arms of rugged peak one statue is broken off at the pedestal, but opposite, it still stands a primitively carved statue of a woman with butterfly wings eternally facing north with a roughly carved, 8 pointed star. Graven into her forehead.

01:56:19

A quarter mile beyond a cave, mouth yawns at the head of a valley with a card stone, lintel and door posts etched with faded stars. The entrance to the path of spirits.

01:56:36

Not in this point, spit ominous. As soon as you take shelter in the path of spirits, you hear the storm breach, a peak of rage. Fuck you. As one of the only things, a storm cannot destroy. It's the earth.

01:57:03

A long dark path of the spirits of the trip of approximately 50 miles, the entrance at the gates of desna to the oak tall and the necropolis ancient nomads. Delved only where necessary following natural faults riffs cave systems, the tunnel has many steep slopes and narrow passages that can be traversed by lone humanoids but are difficult to navigate with wagons because of the darkness and the close quarters.

01:57:29

The caravan moves it only half its normal speed.

01:57:36

The very first thing that you find traversing, this path. Boom. Boom is a can of stones and skulls. The skulls are all embedded in the cairns northward face and are painted with red demonic. Faces knowledge. Religion checks for those that have it, that doesn't seem, he doesn't.

01:58:04

Uh, i'm sorry. It's some reason been didn't know it checks, i swear they used to be under. I used to be able to bring them up under the skills tab. You can you might have the wrong character selected, that happens to me. Every time we change maps, ever, since we were given control of other characters i'm like, yeah.

01:58:26

Have you weigh-in doesn't have any knowledge skills? Yeah. Okay, i'm usually all for well, you should have knowledge, religion.

01:58:40

A 23 for the the native from this area, you immediately recognize the symbol of fumiyoshi, the tien god of dishonor and the graves and the undead.

01:58:56

I do not like this.

01:59:17

Yes, so it takes two days to walk, the path of spirits at half speed actually, excuse me. So, half speed would be 16 miles a day. So, it would take you three, three and a half days to walk the entire path.

01:59:37

And we are going to take our little break here. Do you still have that that break module thing? I do i keep forgetting to use it. Thank you, right?

02:03:18

Watch them, or

02:05:10

In the main job tonight, for hydrugs.

02:08:48

Okay, no.

02:09:24

I figured it out. No, but i have them.

02:11:58

Mina, i do not know because i think you bought it not in my operation.

02:12:29

I was gonna say 70.

02:12:39

You know.

02:12:48

I am out of vape juice. I can't find any disposables. I had to go out to my truck to get nicotine pouches.

02:13:04

I'm struggling. I'm sorry. This is not that bad. I just knew i couldn't sit here for two hours. I was like, let's be real with ourselves. I am on week. Four of completely quit. You are a legend. Thank you. It has been excruciating. I've been doing keto also recently, trying to get back on it because i'm the heaviest of ever been in my life which was like, not chill to realize.

02:13:35

So i'm like i will buy it as much nicotine as i want because i'm losing weight and that's more important to me right now.

02:13:47

Um while you're here, son's gonna ask him, no. Actually, i might not have to really let me say. Oh, i didn't mean it. No no, it's fine. Actually, i might fix it my figured out.

02:14:11

Maybe both of you are smarter than enough that to help me figure out, i was trying to do a formula. Also for guarded on my character sheet, it's part of my order abilities at second level you get dr1 and plus two. Morale bonus on saving throws conditional lead to blah, blah blah.

02:14:33

And then at six level and every four levels thereafter, increase the dr. By one. What form do you want to? You put into make that work. I try to do like samurai level. Minus one divided by 4 or samurai level minus 1 divided by four floor. And that gave me like point before i put floor.

02:14:57

It was a quarter. And what are you trying to do? Sorry. So that i've saved, i think. Well yeah i think i miss heard you. So i will copy. What ability is this? Let's start with that guarded on my sheet, it's one of my order abilities. Okay, second level, the cavalier getting the cr1 dash and a plus two more.

02:15:21

Also going to swim wearing light armor or no armor and fighting defensively or using combat expertise at six level and every four levels they're after this DR. Increases by one, he loses the benefit of this ability if carrying a medium or heavy load. So kick some level two and then goes up by one every four levels.

02:15:39

How would you math that with parentheses? I honestly wouldn't since DR. Doesn't actually interact with damage in the way that we needed to uh player in my rap game on thursdays. What they did was they created a basically a heel action that was set to their dr that they just clicked after they sustained an attack and healed themselves.

02:16:03

The amount they had over the ER so right now you would have dr2 and the last few marvelous than saving throws. Just staticky. It's static. Yeah, so it should just be in changes and i have all of it built already into the context notes. You just actually have to click on the expanded defenses.

02:16:27

It's all been in there under my combat expertise slash defensive stance buff for elephant in the room. I was just like, i haven't changed it in a while and i always forget to do the dr. So i wanted to update automatically. It was more of along the lines of because i always forget, i've never i've applied the dr.

02:16:46

Like in one fight this whole game. But uh it was more of like how would you make that math formula my brain? Can't comprehend, you know. I i am not good enough with the max to tell you. Abby might be. That was why i asked both of you was like Abby.

02:17:05

You're smarter to be at this sort of thing. It definitely seems like what would you do for that math? So i should probably take full attention to what you're asking. So if i'm understanding correctly thing that you're trying to math, is it the dr? Portion of it? Yeah, the moral bonus is static.

02:17:24

The dr. Goes up by one every four levels, but it has a shelf for the bottom end of it. It kicks in at second level. So, what does that look like parentheses and whatnot? Oh, that's actually not terribly. That's what the difference. Um, you just have to flatten it out first.

02:17:38

So, which order was it does that? Uh, this is order of the eastern star. That makes sense. All defensive stand stuff. Um, so kicks in its second level and then goes up by one every four levels. So the sunrise levels divided by four

02:18:18

Hello. I returned. Welcome back. You probably it's tricky because it doesn't necessarily count the, i mean it does, but it doesn't, you know what i mean? Like the first level.

02:18:40

We don't have to worry about this. I was just wondering if you guys were renewable formula for that if you run into one like that before. Don't one before but i'm trying to remember the order of operation. So yeah, like i said, i the first time i attempted it, it came out when i put it into like self rules as like a quarter of a bonus and then it came out to like zero and the negative 1.

02:19:01

When i started like flipping around the divided by 4 and minus 1 and stuff like that because i try to put minus one to take off the other level. I guess that doesn't work, though.

02:19:23

So it has to happen.

02:19:28

Every four levels after second varieties, so it's yeah.

02:19:37

I thought we might be even getting into like if then territory and i was like this is too. Oh god. If we had it, then i'd be so happy.

02:19:48

Um, but now though the best way to do it because you just the same rules as The same rules of this. So, hang on, hold, he's old.

02:20:12

There it is. Okay. What ability did you pull it from starts? It's not pulling it from directly but it uses very similar math to inspired. So we have to do, is you have to, you have to max it. So the ceiling it's impossible, value is zero and then you can like you push it further down so that it starts calculating it from further down the row of like the level rocket.

02:20:50

Insanity.

02:20:54

It looks, it's it do. Um,

02:22:03

I was everyone back. Are we still waiting on Magnus? No, i'm here. Okay.

02:22:13

So as you go deeper down the path of spirits, it gets darker and darker and more treasure to navigate as they described.

02:22:32

No way.

02:22:40

The young choir.

02:23:02

Just out of interest. Can you see other people's? Um, macros that they created. Uh, yes, actually, i see all of them school, all of them, including your various weapon attacks, you've all made. I have so many.

02:23:26

Um, but it's fine. You need me to be able to see something. Uh, i don't like to see something but i i do want you to run something but tell me are all the buffs off of Grayson like involving tundle.

02:23:45

No, turn them off. Do you want because there's a micro head? That should clear everything that's on it that should make them all. Things actually go away. But if you've already got both running, it might be turn. All my bus off.

02:24:08

So um, about a marker, it's called Oraclear. But uh, i'd love to put this in and just plan on common but my account because polycloth, instead i will put it, you could put it in discord. That's where i'm putting it. It's common not showing up again.

02:24:41

Oh yeah, it only says null in the drop down right now. Yeah, i'm only getting all as well. I think that's because we're on the explorer token, because we're on the big map.

02:24:55

Very, let me bring you to the path of spirits. But you may have your tokens else has no. Oh well i'm not on the map for some reason. Uh, i'll distract myself on

02:25:20

Shit. Um, i will delete myself by us.

02:25:28

I cannot delete myself.

02:25:34

So what do i do with this? Yeah. I have all mine so you know you're sorry, go for it. You know your hot ball with your macros bottom left. Yes, bottom left, 20 people. Whatever, uh, select an open one and a new window will come up called new macro, okay?

02:25:58

Um so first thing, one of the drop downs there, it says type and it says chat change that script.

02:26:07

Then copy and paste. The thing that i've just put in and discord, yeah, don't even have to save this but you do have to make sure you've got grayson selected and then hit execute macro and it might clear those uh i got did.

02:26:28

And now you should be able to put the box up and they'll go properly. Reflect what you have. Thank you very much, but if you did save that button, you could just put it on like a different row so you don't accidentally hit it later and you could clear them off yourself.

02:26:43

Yeah. I've got this in the in one of the other games, i literally have this on, on my paladin, trim that game. But i had to kind of remember what it was because i can't get to that right now.

02:26:56

Yeah. That should i should do interest. Anybody needs to do this in the future.

02:27:09

No. Why, how about everyone gives me a perception role? No.

02:27:31

To.

02:27:40

As you're all kind of enjoying still waiting on areas. Yeah. So as you're all kind of, i mean, walking along down this path of spirits scouting through one of these natural caves to make sure that the caravan will fit through the ice in stone of the cavern starts budding.

02:28:08

Not again, rapid rapid succession and then several yetis roar as they come running down the tunnel.

02:28:26

No, they're very much yetis, big hairy.

02:28:42

Big hairy yetis. I say we attempt diplomacy.

02:28:58

Oh boy. Beginning to think i should rename. One of my swords to diplomacy.

02:29:10

Well, unfortunately for amigo, she can't actually see them even with coyot's lights still going. So, she's just gonna cast my shoes into the darkness. Uh no. She's casting used on herself. There we go. I was like why don't, why isn't my duck vision looking? There we go. Hey, should OG be at full health?

02:29:39

Yeah, you're on. You're on day two of your check along the spirits, past the spirits.

02:29:51

I am cool.

02:29:55

Shield. Sadly with my retrain. Oh wait. I get one. Forgotten trick a day then increase it in. I'm so sorry. Ochi should should i shoot these things or do you want me to wait for some some talking? He's gonna say let me talk to them. Let's we can resolve this peacefully, basin will, and then he'll use his action to cast dark skin on himself.

02:30:31

I'm fully gonna try and speak yeti on my turn. Okay. Okay, you actually had me going there for a second. I actually thought no. Oh, geez. Learned, he's grown a little bit. He's completely silent grace and i think knows this and doesn't actually ask this question. He just pulls out his sword getting ready to murder some more things.

02:30:59

Some more living things? I don't think, i don't think. Grayson knew you were joking because the yetis are moving.

02:31:09

I mean christmas's got six charisma. He he yeah. He doesn't think coach is joking. All right, so that is a 26 stitcher 500. AC that'll do, do we have any kind of buffs for cold damage right now? I'm not currently activated. Okay. And i'm sorry my ACs should actually be lower because i had the defensive stance on for messing with stuff but i'll take that damage and 14 points of damage.

02:31:39

Is this Yeti drawers leaps, forward and sinks his fangs into you. Oh, nice and not any form of pleasant way. What is the knowledge? Check yetis. Boom, there are monsters humanoids.

02:32:05

Holy share, knowledge. Check. I can participate on. What? They are vulnerable to fire. They are pretty much impossible to scare.

02:32:24

You also know these ones have class levels. These are Yeti. Barbarians, why? Why not, uh, you also know that they can rent viciously with their claw attacks. And i suppose i like i don't diplomacy is not important, do they speak any languages? They speak aklo and aklo alone.

02:33:01

But doesn't it just goes well,

02:33:20

I unplugged my mouth. There we go.

02:33:35

That later.

02:33:53

Gonna take a bite out of you. He's not uh the yetis bite, bounces off of a micro shield spell new way.

02:34:12

Yeah, not mine for the pharmacy.

02:34:19

I am going to launching trick and move to a different location.

02:34:36

Ah, let's see here. Here is, i don't see invisibility, do they? They have sent.

02:34:50

Well, not immediately. They'd have to pinpoint your location. You're safe for now. Yeah, yep. I'm good for now but it seems to be there and i am invisible.

02:35:07

I'm gonna i think, i guess they do well thing, i get out of knocked out in the hospital, do you?

02:35:20

Minimum invits not that any of you can see anything right now. And that is my tongue addition to drawing. As i move five foot step, and start the rondo.

02:35:45

Everyone throw on haste. Yeah.

02:36:11

You little drummer boy. Oh he doesn't like me. I think i'm gonna use dodging for mash on this one. Oh so oh never mind. Never mind. He's so he's in ruptured by your drumming. That he falters in his attack. We're enter cave in the showgirl starts up the rock.

02:36:33

This party by watching, it just fucking resounds in the acoustics of the stone. Natural cavern, congratulations. The entire mountainside. Now, hears, you i have brought the magic of rock and roll to these people. No, you've done the drums in the deep.

02:37:03

Okay. Okay, i'm being serious guys. These echo through this natural stone cavern. Ochi is going to take a five foot step forward. I mean, what's the worst thing? We could be down here and then he is going to challenge this one.

02:37:34

Face me for a ball and then he will swing on him several times take offense to that. All right, that was way in, but

02:38:01

All right. The 23 and the 27 will hit. Oh, she's dual wielding two-handed, katanas. No, that the extra ones for haste. Did i have it? It's normally prompts me. Oh, there was a checkbox for it. That's why i forgot to press. That makes sense. Oh you're not a, you're not a dual wielder anymore.

02:38:22

You got one big katana. Yes, he took. He got the, he was given the golden katana. That the nameless samurai was wielding on the. I don't know if the 23 hits. It includes the seven from the challenge, uh, first attack image 25. Yes.

02:38:49

You just needs? Yeah. Seven more damage. I don't know if you got that. I apply that anywhere. No, i'll do it manually. Yeah, i'm sorry. I've been since I've made seven because it's only on the one first at first hit. That's why i put it in the effect notes because there's absolutely fine.

02:39:07

No house might work too. There's no good way to do that. In foundry. All righty, you cut soundly into this yeti savage.

02:39:25

Anything else on your turn? Um, somebody already knowed them, right? Anybody knowledge to them. Yoko did. Yeah. Uh, there. Um, their monsters kill them. They are not good, okay. O21 is turned if you've got any fire use that. Oh yeah, why does it say? Zero attacks of opportunity that will.

02:40:07

I like step.

02:40:17

Reaching gray is cooking for some reason. What?

02:40:41

Because the formula is broken for some reason. We're just gonna do to raise. There we go. It's fix calm. The buck down.

02:40:59

Play. It's going to step back so she does not get attacks opportunity.

02:41:09

It being rapid shot. Our first zach will miss but her second attack would hate.

02:41:21

Bringing us to the final yeti. Savage, did you get a haste attack? He did not. I forgot to click haste. You can go there and she missed.

02:41:56

Can't get us.

02:42:04

You, you may have a problem standing in that square.

02:42:10

Oh dear.

02:42:15

Oh, I didn't see you there. That's the points. All right, well, he's thinking it raised attack. So, if you want, i'm just saying

02:42:37

Uh, shoko a spear buries itself solidly in the stone next to you. Oh, that looks nasty.

02:42:51

Uh, no one with there gonna be something.

02:42:57

I'm gonna regret doing this but sure. Why not? Oh well i got a 50/50 chance to knock that fucking blobbered. So sure, why not?

02:43:16

You don't have that. I do have this.

02:43:28

It's, in fact, i put in

02:43:33

Of something strike is on. I assume you are up to five. Yep.

02:43:44

It goes five of his eight, natural armor and bleeding. I like to think that as, as this yeti comes in, with his spear and like, throws it the arm that it was throwing it with. Just collides ever so nicely with a wakazashi place that like, just the right place.

02:44:13

Just whoops, did i do that? He said he just streaks in pain.

02:44:54

Oh, that was his turn. Not your turn. I'm sorry, i may go.

02:45:08

Not really anywhere, good to go.

02:45:14

You move. She's gonna try and acrobatic.

02:45:21

Nope.

02:45:30

Wow. Okay. So, becoming a sorcerer with the right choice. For i'll makeo. She has found her calling in life.

02:45:45

And that should only be, it should not be free. Why is it three?

02:46:04

And,

02:46:16

And then i may go throws out some golden red flames.

02:46:25

So much damage.

02:46:32

And pretty much. That's the yeti on fire. Grayson, when it first it will take a five foot step forward and he is gonna shoot at b1 right in front of him.

02:47:02

Like arrow. Um, third arrow. Well, fourth arrow, first one missed. All right. You have two arrows left and they're both hits where you want them to go uh to the one down next to nohe.

02:47:21

Could i few arrows sink into this? Poor yeti who is currently vomiting on? No way with blood gushing. Out of his balanced arm i could do without that box.

02:47:41

All right, if you give people these conditions, you have to suffer the consequences of giving out these conditions.

02:47:51

And then you're second to do to the pain. Not because i'm making you ill. I've seen people vomit from getting that, let that level of pain is atrocious. I've seen my brother do that from. I'm a very swift kicking balls. Oh, i need that in my head. Oh gee, you're unfortunately in full attack range.

02:48:16

That's a real life. Secret condition for all of us. Uh, i believe in 25, misses it do and then the two claw attacks, a 26, and a 28. Tell me one of those misses. So, my AC is actually too higher against the challenge target. So excellent. Is it? Thank you.

02:48:39

Go to me. No. So only one hits. The 20 hits buck. All right. So, 23 points of damage.

02:48:55

I'm sorry, so one of those claws hit and he gets to rent.

02:49:03

Wait, so when it's what's your AC? It's against that particular guy is 28, okay? So one cloud does miss. Yes, that's what i said. Okay, that's not what i heard, i'm sorry. No, that's okay. I just wanted to clarify. No, you don't get the render, then just the the claw attack that hit.

02:49:19

So just the 13 is the 13.

02:49:26

No way. This is your taste of what the baddies are in the final dungeon you guys yetis.

02:49:42

It might be a bunch of yetiest guys. Yeah. Okay. Me. So in this big adventure of dragons and undead and witches, and all that, all i filled up and the finale is a bunch of furry boys. Just a bunch of frap. Rose chilling in their ice basement, so yeah, i can't do that.

02:50:13

They have a case. I want to move around in that fashion. So i'm not actually going through those squares, but i would like the acrobatics around that. I would like that, too. Very much, please.

02:50:29

That is a five.

02:50:34

Checks.

02:50:39

They only have two legs, i assume like, actually probably fail. I mean, these things a website. I don't want to say you're two to four under.

02:51:03

Do she make it? Oh, you rolled Yep. Man, socks of opportunity. I'm taking.

02:51:20

Yes. Yes. All right. First bite. Wow. Terrible miss. That's, and it's not even within times within five to get rid of my image, so that's that's good. Thank you bite. Oh, there it is. 50 percent chance because i have a mirror image. All right. Higher low in your favor, high is bad.

02:51:50

So i would like 50 or on there and of course, you roll the sex number so yeah. Yeah, that's it. Actually you don't correct because rhonda? Hey, rondo. Yeah. Yeah, you got a 19 right now. Yeah. All right. And final attack.

02:52:11

Yay. Rondo, gay run though. But you've lost your images. Yeah, that's fine. That was a perfectly adequate use of that thing in my opinion this one. It was so that was your movement. It was right. Um we're we're going to just stop the one that i'm now planking. Yes.

02:52:36

Like real life, spanking.

02:52:45

Do it in, do it back head.

02:52:52

Which really just unfortunate for all of these guys. What is the rondo have to do with it? Not hitting it, gives them a plus 20 feet from here and to two of those attacks for 18. So, one short of her AC of 19 with rondo going,

02:53:16

Noise defense is not being hit. It's a very good defense granted. But when it works, yeah, yeah. I'm i'm out. Thanks. Thanks first.

02:53:32

All right. Next up, shoko.

02:53:40

Um,

02:53:49

Don't goes going to produce his blade and of five foot forward.

02:54:03

Target for this fellow.

02:54:11

A taste look full attack and double botch. Uh, but also creek confirm oh that doesn't fun. Oh, they have a 16 AC.

02:54:31

Uh, when they're not sickened, i should say or flent.

02:54:43

So yeah 16 damage total is my grand contribution enter or sorry 18 when they're after their blends.

02:54:59

You are also in full attack rage, the bite. Um,

02:55:12

And i will, i was gonna, i was gonna parry the first claw to try and avoid the The rent. Please do raise the temperature, very

02:55:27

I do not successfully parry these guys have a high attack bonus. All right, clicking this button.

02:55:38

All right, so how much damage is this total? Um and remember, i'm taking five less on everything that doesn't have a bludging with it. So yeah, yeah. I'm just i'm just, i'm just trying to uh that's right. Yeah yeah. Okay. Okay. But the two damage numbers. But okay. So the the damage is, including okay,

02:56:09

Just wanted to make sure i wasn't missing anything. I didn't mean for you to, i didn't mean to ask you to do it for me.

02:56:20

Hello guys. Room. So that is the y8 savage.

02:56:30

Ochi. It's really hoping. This guy would be dead.

02:56:43

He's not dead though. Yes.

02:56:59

You just have to delay my plan to turn. I guess. So, we're gonna

02:57:11

We're going to five footstep there. Full attack. This gentleman, this gentle person. I don't want to assume here. Do some stabs. Are they evil? I'm assuming they're neutral uh the yetis. Yes. No. They

02:57:39

Oh normally. Yes, they are neutral, but compatible ones, but they're evil. Uh they're they're not actually evil okay, which is weird. They should be evil.

02:58:05

Do some swinging.

02:58:22

How's that work out?

02:58:29

I don't see anything. I had it on cell phone, i'm sorry.

02:58:42

There you, can we see now?

02:58:49

Yes. Oh my goodness. Okay, so if they see is actually 13 now, he has, he has been fenced, so that 15 hits and then that critical hits uh bringing him to one hp. Exactly. So you stamp him and then take out one of his Achilles tendons, bringing him to his knees.

02:59:15

You may flavor the kill. However, you would like, with your final haste of attack in his frustration at how much these guys are doing with their claws. I think the final one is coming straight down overhead and splitting the skull, uh, very furiously.

02:59:36

Getting down.

02:59:42

Um, and i think that's gonna be OG strand.

02:59:53

Bringing us two coins turns to come here.

03:00:11

Okay. Everyone caught pretty fucked up. She's gonna do it again.

03:00:29

Oh, i could see a mako's health bar. I didn't see that for the longest time. Uh, yeah. I picked her token. That's quiz turn.

03:00:46

Oh, now oh, she's in full attack range. This is ochie's. Second turn in full attack range. Uh 25. Misses i believe and then a 26 and 26 to hit.

03:01:02

I want to say for some reason that those don't, but i think they do hold on.

03:01:14

Yeah, i'm pretty sure those do although he takes five point damage from bleeding on his turn.

03:01:26

Yeah, those are both going to hit.

03:01:34

Which, of course, means

03:01:44

Friend, uh, that yeti is not long for this world. She's thinking.

03:02:02

Well, fuck. One of her razor flame, just completely misses the yeti and hit the wall. It's actually quite comical. How badly it misses christen. That shouldn't be heard much echo. I'll just fire at the eddie.

03:02:33

Pick only two. No. Maybe the that yeti has a 15 ac. So the first two arrows hit and eat him. The third arrow is not enough to hit the remaining Yeti but the 18 and the 30. Will he roars and pain in defiance but does not go down?

03:03:09

Boom. But yet, he's dead that yet. It's dead and they're bleeding. So, no way. Oh no, you're bleeding. This i won't would be ashamed. A few decided to join your friends and being completely.

03:03:39

All right, um,

03:03:46

I hi there's think attack in there.

03:03:56

Yeah.

03:04:00

I just broke like super flow for thing and again, and i didn't power attack. Believe print. Stop second, bleed and losing five armor class. It's all right. Chuckle quickness up. Uh, yeah, that yeti looks fucked up. That brought him the six hp and he's got five boys damage around so

03:04:33

Hi.

03:04:38

He continues to roar in defiance. They fight savage lead to the death.

03:04:47

They can't flee and he has no real avenue of escape.

03:04:56

And then sugar's first step, bring some low.

03:05:08

Foot sword of foot popping. So, and i was only uh, two rounds, right? So i think i've got two or three rounds. I do not remember but i think we were in the third round. All right. Okay. So three so we are not uh, tired.

03:05:40

Mission gives a shoku, a big pat on the back. He's like well then choco. Excellent. Oh yeah. Do you have now taken the most powerful healing spell that koya has ever cast? Yeah, you were her first cure critical. Beautiful. Thank you, coya.

03:06:10

Russell looks down and don't giant. Massive burn muscle. This means like, wow. Yeah, i never really saw myself here. How high were these ledges? I had meant to ask.

03:06:28

Um, very gentle slope. Looking at these yetis. Is there anything weird about them? Like shoko will set up a detect magic. So, all four of the yetis are actually wearing enchanted pendants. They each have an amulet of natural armor plus one and a sphere on them.

03:06:54

How my fuck? They haven't gaming dodge. Very important. Uh, but they were only third level librarians. So yeah, you you, lastly, out level them. Would cry on beforehand. I mean if you get in vastly i'll level those yetings. They would have murdered the party. One of them appears behind noah and is a tenth level ninja.

03:07:26

Oh my god. I mean that would certainly be a surprise. Okay. Fucking does the whole ninja yeti? Uh, grace. I'm gonna hold up the the amulets to show going to be like anything wrong with these. Are we good to toss them in the bag? Oh, not that i can see but i can't really tell you of something's cursed or not.

03:08:01

It turns to sequoia, can you?

03:08:08

Spears weren't magical at all. The streets are not magical there, just plain fears, which reminds me, but the only treasure they have it is the only treasure they have.

03:08:27

Kids are longer invisibility and be like i will be right back. I just want to make sure we're not gonna get randomly, jumped by whatever else is in here. Oh, and then they also have standard treasure. Sorry, i mean they probably heard my performance. So yeah. Oh yes. Do you think you could hit like um my shield with the light spell or something?

03:08:53

Because i might need to take uh, going on this.

03:09:00

So i'm using my actual thing for this very light. So, beyond the realm of the lights fell back there. This is all in darkness, right? That is correct. Okay, oh wait, no. I don't need coya for for a lifestyle. I'm a kitchenette. Oh, i know, i think i took, i think the alternate racial trip.

03:09:23

Got rid of that, never mind.

03:09:27

So,

03:09:31

Grayson. We never go anywhere. Nice. After traversing the long dark tunnels of the path of spirits, the caravan draws near to the uktal necropolis deep beneath the wall of heaven. All right? Still do have right within a mile of the necropolis, the tunnels become wider and straighter and rows of skulls.

03:09:54

All facing due north are laid in unbroken lines. Along each side of the passage other tall who originally built in the cropolis were worshipers of desna. They're descendants. Did not remain faithful to the goddess. Boom. Boom.

03:10:17

You don't actually need no. All of that. Meanwhile back in the dream. The corey wasn't memberfully does most like while you're there hun. Can you just like, clean it up a little? Clean it off a little just get rid of some heresy, you know, cleaning Quicker guns.

03:10:46

Can we hit the rest button? You do go an entire day on your way here. So yes, you may hit the rest button.

03:11:02

And much as i love these oriental maps that they made, for this adventure path. I am so glad we're leaving book three so that i don't have to use all of these ice covered ones anymore that are super washed out really hard to get these darker. Anybody own tokens with vision right now.

03:11:25

No. Okay. Just checking.

03:11:35

Oh,

03:11:50

I don't think i'll have kids any magic. I think i'll take meal. Ah, we are gone. I have way Ann's vision right now wherever he is. Your ownership observer.

03:12:12

I do need one. Random numbers in the darkness. Oh no, i forgot to hide the text. Just nice to. Yeah, three and five. I didn't see what the text was because i wasn't that zoomed in. But i did see the floating three and five.

03:12:38

Hey, where do you believe? We're Grayson highlighted a second ago.

03:12:49

All right. Oh, they go now good.

03:12:57

Uh yeah. The darkness. Is it no longer dark out.

03:13:22

My stock right?

03:13:35

Animation speed, slow the fuck down, so you don't make people dizzy and sick.

03:13:53

There we are. All right. S1. The pillared path. The tunnel here is clearly worked the floors and walls smoothed and decorated with faded cave, paintings of starry, skies colorful auroras and pale. Headless shades march along the path regularly spaced humans. Stone pillars decorated with star. Carving stand on either side of the tunnel without each pillar.

03:14:20

Since a bleached human skull painted with red demonic faces.

03:14:29

So each of these little white spots, right here is a little pillar with skull on it.

03:14:38

So um, i must have missed the setup to this because i thought we were going through. Like i don't see how we're going to get a caravan through this.

03:14:54

Take care of animal fit through eventually, okay? Um, this should be roughly like 10 feet apart. I'm sure you can get a caravan through that. They're not 10 feet wide.

03:15:13

Let's be honest, these maps are abstractions. They are right, and these are very old maps. I've done my best. Restoring them to degree, the inside tunnels are just wide enough to fit your wagons across basically except for one little area that they don't really give me any explanation for that.

03:15:35

We're gonna hand wave over. So with my detect magic, still up. I'm going to scan this hallway for 18. Seconds to see if like there's any magical traps here. Nope i'm not. I'm just going to use my eyes.

03:15:55

And film miserably, but you know,

03:16:02

Nope, you don't find any traps in this hallway, all right. Charcoal approach, one of the skulls and try to suss out its purpose and or meaning Or fumeyoshi's things is he fully gonna pick one up and be like to be or to not to be uh you recognize the symbols of desma on the walls that have been vandalized and the red skull paintings on the skulls is more homeyoshi paraphernalia.

03:16:32

All right i'm going to need more on for me. Okay. Oh you said he was the god of i deceit death and undead when so you know how super cute and dark place? Yeah, when we oh, she was one that killed him from yoshi. Got real jealous of shizuru and his brother.

03:16:55

By the way, he's nookiel's brother. I'm gonna kill my brother because he's mad because he's doing too successfully and she will be interestaroo was like he's cute. That's that's cute, that's fun. No uh sent off her husband to go and get raised by pigong and then it's like okay so you for me or she can go under rot in the tomb.

03:17:22

That was supposed to be susukio because you can go there and i'm gonna lock the door and you can fucking rot through them. Fuck around. There's a reason she's called the empress of heaven. That's pretty much everything you need to know. But from Yoshi, he's so interested. Dishonor, envy graves.

03:17:45

And undead were his areas of concerned neutral, evil known, as the lord of envy. It's eat eggs. Punish those who have unwarranted. Good fortune. Devour the pleasures of the living encourage resentment. Make graveyards. Supernaturally unsafe who has had the best roles this campaign? Grayson. Maybe if we kill grace and from yoshi will look upon the favor, i will only accept deaths in the form of a ingested poison.

03:18:26

You're never gonna let that go away, but you're never going to let your your little uh pet name for me. Go either. Are you legs freak of nature? Yeah, that one. Oh, Hi, but mine's accurate.

03:18:45

Hey, come on, you're two. Let's get going. Don't want to keep the lord of n be waiting.

03:18:55

I'm sure he can wait a little longer.

03:19:02

Come along koi. Anwan. Where's a mako? Do i just not have vision on her? Oh, she's under plan. Okay.

03:19:15

All right, this area here. Okay, move everyone over to a little more.

03:19:25

Still like the yetis typically worship, don't you see? Carbs bridge spans a deep crevasse in this large universe at the each end of at each. End of the bridge stone pillars support, a flat lintel car with star-shaped, niches set with red painted human skulls. On either side of the far lintel a dusty portal of stone marks.

03:19:53

One face of an angular tower built into the rock with narrow slit windows, overlooking the bridge. I, you know, understand that these are towers that are two stories tall and they have arrow slit windows at the top.

03:20:14

These are actual buildings. These are buildings. Yes. And this is a bridge and what's on the other side that we can see, just the continuation of the passage, just the continuation of the passage. We should probably check these doors before going across the bridge that idea stand back. No signs of people or life as you approach the bridge, a barrier of anti-life erupts, there it is.

03:21:03

And you leave written. Oh actually, who speaks eritage? Hi, no way. No, a youth pictographs on the stone face in front of the bridge. They're erotaki picture graphs and they really hear the dead walk. Trouble them. Not nor bar their path here the dead walk trouble them, not nor bar their path.

03:21:38

Kristen looks at Shoko and koya and Amico is like, so any three of any idea, what this barrier does knowledge arcana. Oh, doesn't the you mentioned it earlier? The the there's nothing of the spirit's supposed to find their way to the northern star. Yes.

03:22:12

So why would there be an expectation of anything borrowing her

03:22:19

That was about to say any idea princess, then you wrote the one. Um, this wasn't placed by the worshipers of desna. This is an anti-life shell. This was placed by servants of kumiyoshi. Koi is just like nodding sagely. Like yes, i knew this all along. What show goes check.

03:22:45

Can he emit, can he think of a way to get rid of this? You can suppress an anti-life shell uh with the spell magic for an hour after which it reappears. And what happens if you touch it before before? No way. Touches it. I'm not gonna touch it.

03:23:13

She might have to, you bring it to being a mobile, hemispherical energy field that prevents the entrance of most living creatures. The effect, hedges out animals. Aberration, dragon's face giant humanoids. Magical beasts once shows, humanoid oozes plants and vermin but not constructs elementals, outsideers or undead. So i'm gonna just prevent you from moving through it.

03:23:36

I'm gonna i'm getting that a game that's a little bit. This? These aren't ten foot squares or anything, right?

03:23:46

No. Okay, everybody except for shoko can just jump across this. Uh, oh yeah. Might have problems doing that too. We can jump and get a rope across. They can crawl across the road standing with the edge and looking down. What do i see? Ah, the crevice. Let me go back up to here.

03:24:12

The chasm is 80 feet deep their bottoms littered with thousands of bones. Oh,

03:24:25

Down there and inspect them. If you want me to oh, everyone's up at the edge. Excuse me. Oh, but you've approached the edge. Yes. We have see, whatever you're about to do lapel duveed. Oh no.

03:24:48

Oh,

03:24:55

I was concerned when i saw the doors and i hate when i'm like

03:25:08

Just fantastic initiative roles all around today.

03:25:17

Unclear, join us initiative. Foreign reinitiative roles and rolled like trash on each of them. I see that. And she only rolled it two Desmos like i gave you the plot point, dude. I just told you where to go. You got to deal with things when you get there. Come on.

03:25:38

That's not my job. There's no you never think things thrill no. It's like, my, my whole stick, my ways of a notable and elderly. Bump bump.

03:25:59

So that is going to bring us to no way who's going first and i need something a little more.

03:26:15

Composters, people arctic attack. Yeah. So, um,

03:26:28

I feel like she would have been looking at the auntie life thing the whole time. Like how do we circumvent this? And then he has doors of man's like oh, if you guys are trying to look at,

03:26:43

Oh, yes. And everyone see their their artwork. Yes, i can definitely importance. Oh, can i make a knowledge religion? Yes. Yeah, you might.

03:27:02

Well, that's actually a 32. Uh, yes. So headless wardens.

03:27:16

Are basically.

03:27:22

There's the guardians of crips.

03:27:29

Uh, likely these are here to protect them necropolis or were guards. The died in the acropolis.

03:27:40

Within the hotel in the crop. Plus a headless warden, it's guided and warded by the spirits of the dead, that swirl around the lord and pale blue, linguists, be spirits, grant, the warden blindsights defeat, and make it difficult for the words enemies to see it. Oh, So, that really needs to be on

03:28:07

All right, i didn't ask if we could see anything or signs of movement and stuff. Well, hey, i that if there is slits and stuff, we would have seen the glow coming out of the towers now. No, the arrow slits are are up on the second story. Gotcha, we lost abby.

03:28:38

I could have swore, i'm maintain.

03:29:36

Be an aura, doesn't it?

03:30:09

So yeah sugar will uh tell oh well we have to wait for Abby to get back.

03:30:53

All right, so that's the door. Is open all of these widths come pouring out of the room.

03:31:03

Oh, i should finish describing these to you since you made that check. Okay, they can do battle with the spirits that are surrounding them.

03:31:19

Uh and the flame feels 24 points of negative energy damage plus additional negative energy damage equal to the warden's charisma modifier.

03:31:34

When how did you roll? 28. It's a bit of 15 so it's a plus two 32, actually. Yeah, yeah. They're they're decent. Uh, they also have mummy rocks, so i guess their mummies of some kind. I don't. It doesn't say that anywhere.

03:32:10

There, or of this.

03:32:30

People or that's rude.

03:32:56

Below. And you streetwide power cut out. Yeah. She's out for the time. Being it sounds like it's coming back on but she doesn't have internet.

03:33:24

Three saving throw.

03:34:51

Restoration estimate 3. 15. Am.

03:34:58

Okay, are you back at me? Welcome back. So this this time slots fucking cast. But yeah, apparently it was not my street. It was my county. You just have a rolling blackout. All of them. Nope, 2168. Premises.

03:35:32

Stretch.

03:35:36

Let's see what's up real quick? Yeah. Yeah, i'm surprised. I can't i but then again. So, i live right next to an apple. Um, like the busiest airport enough. So it would be very very bad. If it was about that, that's three. I know. I put that on my phone.

03:35:59

Um choco would tell you that these things uh they could see you. They have 60 foot lines once. Yes, delightful. Oh, also they uh it's a lot harder to hit them if you're not right next to them.

03:36:23

So what what are they exactly had this Walgreens

03:36:30

Yeah, that's what that's what we got. Had this wardens, they guard things.

03:36:39

Nate. I guess they actually like full ghosts, a little like, animated bones or something. Like i, they are not in corals, they're actually more, like, mummies. They even carry the vulnerability to fire. Uh and mummy rot i like neither of those statements. Um and pop because i can't exploit the first one and second one makes me want.

03:37:08

Oh, shoko nods says also you're gonna want to hit him with fire and also they'll give you mummy rot. You don't want to know what that is and there's something about blindsight, but i don't know if we as characters know about that, i got a 32 on my check to know what these things do.

03:37:31

Yeah, okay. So he knows like foreign some shit, right? Okay. Oh all right. All right. Um there's not really too much. I can do friends, but there's one other thing. That needs to happen. You're fucking kidding me. So uh you want a website, i need four wheel saves back to back to the back right now.

03:38:08

Uh, 30 feet. I think you are all actually actually you are not some no. Okay, so you're out of range of one of them oxy.

03:38:28

Well, it's it's my turn so i'm sorry. It's a will save for four separate oras of despair. Yep. Oh, i fail the first one immediately so you can continue as you wear as i am paralyzed for however many rounds continue as i was figuring out. What got happened? What happens to manuals?

03:38:51

We want to take 10 on wheel saves. Nope, it all happened immediately or it happens on your turn contract. Even if i, if i took 10, i'd still felt so everything you are. You are fine. So, how many i will go next? Uh, so

03:39:21

To follow.

03:39:28

Do i even bother making the other three saves? Or, nope, once you paralyzed you are immune to the ability.

03:39:39

And so i don't have an auto countdown module.

03:39:49

I did not think all of the graphics in this scene through. There's a lot going on. I like it. It looks sick. I mean baseball in the description of everything. It sounds. There's a lot going on in-game too, uh so. Oh gee, let's do yours or showcas but show goes down for three.

03:40:14

God damn it. Oh geez. Down for three. Wait, how are we down for three? Where does it say that? You guys are so failing. The first one i dropped.

03:40:30

I haven't had to roll any others.

03:40:35

Let's do coya. Good.

03:40:44

Excellent.

03:40:58

And good. Okay, so call you in. Brace are fun. This is where the samurai really struggles is for consecutive. Will saves to be paralyzed professed. Yeah.

03:41:21

God damn. All right, i might go uh, and for expediency. I'm just going to say way angles and falls over where it stands? Yeah. Oh Grayson you are right in the way of this dude. Sure.

03:41:44

Three rounds. You said, right? Three rounds. It is round one on round four. We can do stuff again. Beard, slams. I miss regular slams, i miss

03:42:05

A mako's good. I hate to do this to you, Grayson, but weren't those against the spot flooded Your point is valid. Uh, what's your flat footed? Ac 323 yeah, 23. So, the first one would it?

03:42:31

Only three seems like a lot for your flat but it AC for a monk. No high wisdom. Yeah. Yeah. I have like no dexterity.

03:42:46

I thought you lose your monk bonus to AC. If your flat-footed?

03:42:54

I believe does that, you don't, because it functions as you roller these bonuses to acpy, even when against touch attacks or when the monk is flat footed. Excellent. Okay. Loses them when immobilized or helpless and you did not get paralyzed. So you're fine. Okay, so just the five damp negative damage from the first one.

03:43:16

Correct. All right, i may go is going to smite.

03:43:35

And you said that they were vulnerable to fire, right, right.

03:43:55

Are you kidding me? They really crammed all the lord of the rings crypt tropes into like one thing they did. Yes, like the bottom something. I don't know.

03:44:13

Maybe we just gotta wait for the big fiery demon creature to show up. Yeah. And then, after down here, we've left trapped bello. I mayco's gonna lead to undead army of spirits to reclaim her throne. That'd be quite the tip twist in the story.

03:44:34

And if you guys make an idea of badass shadow ninja instead, but that's okay.

03:44:45

Wow, with the botching. Amigo. That's like our third watch in a row. I know, but she still does a fuck ton of damage with that second ray shoko. That's one round of paralysis, right? Oh yeah.

03:45:12

Oh, it's gonna come right here.

03:45:21

Where's the trouble? Domains like isn't one of its things like freedom of movement, like all that. Yeah, like a little liberation. And i think probably might have freedom but in more importantly, doesn't the stuff that she has hopefully something like that the staff of journeys. I don't remember exactly what those.

03:45:42

So, uh, so decorative wildflowers in different kinds of leaves that you allows use the following fails, the dictionaries and pits and during elements long strider, pastel trace and freedom of movement, there it is. The freedom of women, just get rid of paralysis bundabar uh,

03:46:11

And she has to touch you for freedom of movement. She can reach out and touch him away reach out, but she can move here because grace is not paralyzed and touched shoko. And no way she touches. No way with a foot and choko with a hand. She's out in both directions, spread eagle in the middle of combat, but

03:46:54

Uses freedom of movement, on. No way she sees them just freeze completely and then and she shared that i don't think she can.

03:47:20

Yeah, caravan with her travel domain abilities but no, you need the the freedom domain liberation. Yeah, liberation. Yes. No way your freed. Me your brothers. Absol. Staff sketchbox.

03:47:51

That's a good alternative. Thank you.

03:48:00

Bobo misses.

03:48:06

That hits.

03:48:14

No problem. All right and where did you say please? DC, 17 close your mouth. Don't let any of the group get in you growth. Wait, what is the onset? It doesn't say.

03:48:32

At some point, i should really commit to reasons to memory.

03:48:38

One minute. Never mind. No fortitude. Now uh you make it over like yeah. We'll just let you keep that um, let me see. Frequency one a day. Oh shit. Okay.

03:49:04

Wait. So he's fine, right? If he makes that safe because it doesn't say multiple saves required. But once you contract it there's no cure except for removing curse to remove disease. Yeah. Am i reading this right? Yeah it's okay. Well, it's better to think of mummy raw as a curse.

03:49:25

Then it's fair that is his turn crease in. You have been a sailed by these headless beasts. Great. It will try to take out this one that's in the doorway here so he can hopefully step into it and block the other one from coming out.

03:49:51

I created tackles.

03:50:01

Uh and unfortunately only the first attack hits.

03:50:13

Oh, i never finished describing them. God damn it. Everybody got uh they also have dr. Five against everything. I and they're fairly difficult to hit these things are dangerous. I think that's it. Uh busters. You ignore the 20% miss chance though. Uh it also it makes it sound like you have to be more than five feet from them for that to apply.

03:50:40

Anyways. Rage attacks or reach attacks.

03:50:51

I think is the way it was worded. Oh made by creatures that are not adjacent to the warden typically because of breach, yes. Oh, you're right and you are adjacent to them. Yep.

03:51:07

Explanation. It's hard to hit these things if you're not right next one. Yeah, but there's i get it. I get it. It's a difference between being able to see them.

03:51:22

With that dozen rock.

03:51:40

Is going to swing amiko is gonna dodging panache.

03:51:51

No, not you.

03:52:04

Which unfortunately does leave room for this gentleman.

03:52:13

With his two juicy paralyzed targets. If he wants, oh god, he's gonna spawn. I kicked me.

03:52:25

Ochi is also paralyzed disney. Yeah. All right. Nope, he's going to swing at amigo and actually hit.

03:52:42

Okay, and i'm just gonna make her fortitude safe now as well.

03:52:49

Wait, never mind. She's immune, right? Protagonist power is yay. No. Uh, no way. Not Noah. No other.

03:53:11

Now aren't free. I am the head, everything about this one.

03:53:21

Some functionately, my increasingly good nature means that i really don't feel like leaving shop or in that position right now. I know koya will deal with this.

03:53:35

With showcode not freedom, you can only do one verse in per turn. One, one person per turn. Yeah.

03:53:47

If we make your decision, any easier show code, does look really funny right now. Paralyzed. He got paralyzed like mid talking about like what the things are. So he's like got a finger up and like, a lecturing pose and he's just frozen solid.

03:54:07

Into spare we should point out in despair. Oh okay. So, let's move. I'm gonna have to think about it anyway, so i would like to move the light here.

03:54:29

Let me see.

03:54:35

To use that new magic in my pepstep and back flip over half of this problem. Then gets to here. And she's like, okay.

03:54:49

Those a bunch of hand signs and i have not done the actual thing for this. But uh, y'all like sonic damage.

03:55:05

So she like, has both of these vocal shoes out fries to do like two two symbols takes in a big breath. And then let's just this just this blocks of sound that comes immediately out. It sounds like almost like a dragon's rule. Um, these squares. So, all right. Yes, there's a ninja trick.

03:55:32

It's a ninja trick. You need a 15 foot cone. I put a sound for it. In discord chat, i can make sounds happen. So, and like that. Is that what you were after that is, no, not completely out of it, exactly how it happened. It's this. It's this incredibly angry.

03:55:59

Well, it's a sovereign dragon. So i had like a way cooler thing of how this actually manifests, but given the situation, she does not have time to do, like the proper hand signals. And this is a botched one. Um as evidenced by the fact that both the major sex.

03:56:19

Uh so they only said half so that's what eight um, nine. You got max rounds to. Yeah, but i can't emulate that for another rounds. Great.

03:56:35

Thumbs up. Uh, these things are not, so they have concealed and they're not in control and they have dr, but they don't have energy resistance so that was still probably your best bus. But yeah, but now i can't repeat that. There's, there's the other thing i can do, but that would hurt.

03:56:58

And i don't know, you know what? Actually, i don't fucking care where we're doing it. We're doing it live fine. And then immediately after after doing, that gets both of the luck because she's puts them to to a collar. Just slashes down and we're getting kamikaze going as well.

03:57:28

Come at me bro. Don't don't pay any attention to those people over there.

03:57:39

Don't do it. But that, that is my turn.

03:57:48

Am paralyzed in paralyzed for one more round. Warden the spirits in their anger, lash out of Grayson missing. And then it swings missing. I'm paralyzed for another round after this. I was paralyzed in round one. That's a full round. This is round two. That's a full round and it's round three.

03:58:18

That's a full round round four. I can act.

03:58:26

Oh, no by quick step there.

03:58:37

I was trying to look up like a brawley scream to see if any of them. Sound cool. Are you kidding me? Let me go.

03:58:53

Still getting used to the magic. Still getting used to the magic. I it's my evil applies. The spells, right? It absolutely does. Yeah, yeah. So, those actually both hit.

03:59:17

And burn that warden down.

03:59:23

Yoko. That's one more round.

03:59:35

Sport and spirits attack sequoia's. Turn getting skipped. Oh, it did skip koya. Oops.

03:59:47

Locoya is going to channel to heal because everyone's kind of getting fucked up.

03:59:58

And she's gonna roll terribly to heal because desna is not at the table right now, please leave a message, not, she told you to come to the necropolis and then she fucked off and then she's going to quick channel to damage.

04:00:39

Okay.

04:00:47

And one of them failed.

04:00:53

And then the headless horseman spirit attack and slammed uh with the 33 on the flame to hit.

04:01:07

I get this grayson. That's certainly don't see an attack. Yeah. It's above koias. All right, be around. You will have previously and yeah, that hit and then bringing up to grace's turn.

04:01:33

That dude in front of you just like whales on you. Oh wow. First three. Arrows myth but then your fourth arrow heads and destroys him. And then grace will take a five foot step in to try to block this guy from coming out.

04:02:14

Well, bum bum.

04:02:22

All right. So, spirits attack koya, they miss the spirits shoes. Not to that thing. And magnif. Yeah, i really wish you hadn't given me that idea. Yes, these things are absolutely yes. Spotter. The spider, someone off of us.

04:02:55

Oh, i tried.

04:03:00

That's all right.

04:03:04

That is the wrong thing. One second cnb. Yep.

04:03:15

I actually think, you know, he doesn't follow you through so you just

04:03:23

How did soccer ball? So 80 feet. Oh, you're fine. So, i did pick up boots of the cat.

04:03:36

Like a the bread with the butter down, you just land on your feet.

04:03:46

Always takes minimum fossil damage from falls as the GM and roll the one on each die of damage occurred by the fall. And at the end of a fall, always lands on a speed yet. So you hit the ground, taking eight points damage but you land on your feet.

04:03:59

Still if your fingers pointed up in that flustering pose? Yeah, no he didn't move at all. It's just the butter. The butter on the bottom of the boots. It just gets pushed and slides still vertical, like a chest and fall straight down and lands on his feet. Uh, but coya does get in the fact of opportunity with her star knife, you know, that thing when someone is like it, when people like trying to flip the ball, to make it land up, right?

04:04:33

Okay, yes. That's what just happened to you. No way. Flooped him off edge. Oh my god. Oh, i should not be amused by that. Um, it's the light bulb of course, you should. It's it's pretty funny. Why are you four feet in the air? I'm not three rounds until i can decide that i want to emulate.

04:04:59

This guy again. This convenient way to track this shit. I suppose it's convenient. Aren't you down to two now? Is that what the number is up? To the left of my token? When i click on it, is that right? It's technically your elevation but i use it to help track things like paralysis here.

04:05:22

I don't have. That's just what i was asking if that was the elevation box because i will use that to do the same only with the modules for Pathfinder second edition. Do i have those things set up? That they will just turn themselves off when they're rounds are done.

04:05:39

It's pretty great. Not that. I'm trying to convince all of you to try out. Pathfinder your second edition. I would i would like to

04:05:52

Right. As i was these baptisms. Do anything special? Just hey, buddy.

04:06:06

Batman come in soon. You don't have to be an owning dude, because

04:06:15

Um, they only speak eritage.

04:06:22

I don't know. You don't even shoko. Barely knows that these things exist. Like these, these undead are specifically for this necropolis.

04:06:38

That you're you're quite done. Was marching the memory of my forefathers. Thank you.

04:06:47

Oh my

04:06:52

Uh, no fun thing shark this time unless i can sneak attacks with choco. Who's powerlies them 83 battle across, that is you know what, that's super fair. But also just really quick.

04:07:15

It's not like the spirits are with me because i'm taking minimum recoil from that. So hey, it's super nice. Yeah.

04:07:25

Um that is that is about like all like news. It was a hint. So you did stuff, okay? You'll be free next round. I am less paralyzed. You are slightly left. Paralyzed. Come on. OT wake up with you. I kind of need you distract this thing so i can shank it.

04:07:51

Oh geez, just despairing. He's over there and just a bird and life is a nightmare. You basically all did just watch Shoko die because i'm 80 feet down. You don't know that. I that landed on my feet. It's true. We don't know. She died in the dark. Oh my god.

04:08:13

He has this might his enemies ruined upon the mountain top guys, he fell down the crevasse. He did. But Eagle old man. Fell into the ground. I called this. I called this. At the beginning of the session. Why your force? Oh no. Oh you need to get out of this so i can murder about the way better.

04:08:35

Clip. Cutscene would have been him on the way down going. Um, are there any birds around?

04:08:43

Uh, so having witnessed someone who was much like a grandfather to her uh a make of screams spends, another smite evil on the one, who's at the cliff and then fires earth scorching, raise at him. Yeah, you do. I'm not. Yeah, you do. I incinerating him.

04:09:16

Yoko. You hear her, her scream of rage in pain.

04:09:24

Uh, and my paralysis fades, this time paralysis fades is turned.

04:09:37

Now it's koya's turn. No, your process feeds next turn. Sorry. Next turn. You're free. Okay. Mako goes, i am the bacon in the refrigerator for all those who cry out, uh, good. I have the alpha and the amigo.

04:10:03

I recently rewatched that same sign of the whole thing. I gotta rewatch it all and you're critical wounds then steps forward. To touch, she does.

04:10:27

Obliterated. Oh uh yeah about half of his body. Just disintegrates in starlight and positive energy. Oh, yeah. Also, looks furious. He was gonna marry that man. Jason, try to finish this off.

04:11:05

So the 25 inch the 22 hits that might have been enough to finish him. It is.

04:11:21

Okay. I'm mad ends and amiko immediately just runs and jumps into the crevasse. I'm sorry. Princess what. Nope, ochi tries to reach out and catch her but is way too late. Oh, i will say that. Like i will say that like as like showcas turn comes around it initiative.

04:11:45

Before she throws herself off. You just hear like a call echoing from now. They're like uh, can i do want to help me up? Or i actually couldn't have stopped to make? Oh, because i still would have been paralyzed for a couple of seconds. I gotta go since we're like half hour.

04:12:07

Yeah over. But yes, want to keep going. Go for it. So omeco feather falls moments before lending next to you, and Lance just fine. Oh no, it was bombers down. Like monkey. Grapplings for a while you. You can't amazing. Oh you're okay. Uh yeah. Uh, these things, i picked them back up.

04:12:38

In that last town. I tapped my heel my foot. We got slope the floor, which makes a crunchy sound because i believe you described this as a carpet of bones. Yep. Huh. Of an internet. One of these and sounds like you're okay down there. Shoco. Uh, well i could use a rope or something.

04:13:04

Uh, i'll lower down a rope. All right, ropes, get lowered, and you get brought back up. Well, we're down here. So it's a bunch of people did die down here. Like what do i find anything down here? I lower him back down.

04:13:23

Um, no. Actually just bones down there. Yes. The eritucky we're not big on bearing treasures with their people. Plus you also know that it's real rude to be robbing graves. Oh, this is a grave. Oh, i thought this was just like a trap. I thought they didn't acropolis. Okay.

04:13:45

Oh, one big burials. Burial site. Shoko puts that fever back heel. He'll use one of his spares. Please leave for many dead alone, but also and then proceeds to start spouting, a lot of curses in error attack. She?

04:14:07

Well, i mean to, what are you saying? Actually really, really this is even in death, you have to be absolute fucking cuts. Could you just not? And i have a peaceful after life or go to the fucking star or something. This is what doesn't want you to do really well one in eritage.

04:14:35

I don't worship doesn't that i worship shaden.

04:14:42

I'm sorry.

04:14:48

I assume you're cursing out. Amigo. No. Oh no. Okay, skeletons. Oh, i thought you were combining you how to make a jumping through the menu. No, no amiko. Like after after that, swearing like turns around. And it's been, like, princess word of advice. If you want to make it look like you've just suicidally, run off a cliff to your death and grief.

04:15:15

Well, done, i can give you an award. Please do not fucking do that again. Shot goes like, so let's just scratch at the back of the bed. I mean well act things like that all the time. What expendable? Of course we fucking do. None of you are expendable. We're not having this conversation and not a single.

04:15:43

One of you. We're already having this conversation. As long as i am in charge of the country, none of my people will be expendable for my life, except me. No.

04:16:01

Oh, she ignores her. Right, no, i agree with you. It's just like i feel like no after that would just cross her arms very like put away both of what was actually cross around. She just go when people offer up to give you their lives, the respectful thing is to let them do that.

04:16:24

Oh, gee puts a hand on how to shoulder and it's like, this is what happens when you take your kids and raise them and another country outside of their culture. She doesn't understand. Don't go soco ignores. Both of you and smiles and uh spouses head and says, i'm sorry to have worried you my empress your kindness honors me.

04:16:54

Omega just huffs and like, embraces, you quite strongly, actually. So go laughs a little and hugs her back.

04:17:13

Everyone. Okay, i'm i'm fine. I just stood there and watched no person looks a little scuffed up. Yeah yeah grayson greyson got a real hard, the man, the myth, the walking tour right now. Convinced that this Grayson is just a freak of nature. There's nothing faints is this, man.

04:17:48

All right. I will describe these watchtowers. Now, this octagonal structure half buried within the stone walls of the cavern rises, another 20 feet above the cavern floor inside a narrow stair. Along the walls leads to a small balcony allowing observers to look out the towers slit windows. A dark corridor leads deeper within the rock.

04:18:10

Hell yeah.

04:18:16

That's crazy.

04:18:21

Three of us are our little scuffed up. So like maybe a few which level one of cure light somewhere.

04:18:34

Actually have the ones of care motor with 19 charges left and i want to cure light with 32 charges left. All right, a few cure lights to round out me and Amica would be appreciated and i think grace and only another big care critical. But yeah.

04:18:55

All right, age for shoco.

04:19:02

You need more. Uh, why is it not? I need a target myself.

04:19:17

Yeah you look at you anymore. It wasn't it wasn't applying. Yeah. Yeah. A little bit more. Huh. 67 plus 4 degrees. We have to full exactly. Yeah, me go.

04:19:41

Does dr. Apply to falling damage. Could we have Sparta checked those things down into the crevice? You know, dead, you still think falling down and treatment. You have to go. So you could have um, enjoying koya here with Grayson more with the wand of care moderate than her entire care.

04:20:04

Critical spell, there's not at the table right now. She wants to leave. These are the graves of the Desmond's. I would not be comfortable with robbing them. Yeah, i don't think there's any reason for us to disturb those. The rest here, an OTL, say a prayer over these horrible horrible, mummy things that tried to kill us.

04:20:33

They seem plenty disturbed as it is says, no. Is you chicks another sculpt? Well, i mean, was any of the magic or like, any of the effects there? Like so it felt pretty evil to me, uh, was it was super evil.

04:20:50

But these back chambers back here.

04:20:59

I think we might be okay to take anything that has the mark of uh uh the asshole on it. Yeah, speaking of um, before we go into either one of these Grayson's, already gone and i kind of need to go to, that is fair. We are rolling super late today.

04:21:19

Yeah, yeah it's sick. I just need vape juice really bad. So here, so advanced warning, i will not be able to make it tomorrow to ayons. Uh, i have i'm gonna be out of the city. Uh, um, okay, uh, you joined the start playing very strange arms, right? I believe.

04:21:49

So,

04:21:54

Oh, never mind, you're fine. I don't have to skip for you. That's right. Okay. All right, y'all. Thanks for this. Have a good night, everyone. This was a good one. Look forward to the next one. Yeah. All right. When writing for all of this by everybody, but
