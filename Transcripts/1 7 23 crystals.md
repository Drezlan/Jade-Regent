00:00

Okay, that's better. Um, and we were going to the storm spire. What's a spire called? Anyone for five v bucks? Um cool. Just make sure you can keep your NFTs. Okay, i don't have any NFTs. I'll make you one, I'll draw one. Um yeah, and we were trying to go in, we park, the caravan aways away, but because there was a large amount of undead around it and a cool ick remote of poison stuff.

00:31

And then it was the bridge was broken in two places and then grayson was like, i'm gonna jump 50 feet over here and then OT and no way over like we're cool too, bro. And then we jumped 50 feet over there and abby did or no way. Did try and scope out the lake juice.

00:51

The juice lake of black juice and because it's black it's i don't know what the word for non- see-through is opaque. It was opaque so we didn't. Yeah it's slushy. Yeah, we didn't see. Uh, the forearm cybermen, the forearm to lakesideman and we didn't see there was like a description, a mushroom hippo, it's so much.

01:17

And then there were some skyrim droger. So the the side of men hiding in the pool of great breezy, out of the qt machine. Oh, so since everyone is aware of what cybermen are and, uh, zero is kind of our yumcha. Oh no. Oh no, i i want to i want ahead that description too but that one's also pretty good.

01:51

Oh my god, a good learning on the scene. Yeah, i'm looking at a black screen right now. Here, let me move you back from the store. Inspire. I actually moved this one on top of and it fits so weirdly perfectly inside of his token border.

02:23

Please continue. Um, yeah. And that's where we left off a no. A is invisible. Oh my god, i forgot about the the plant. Oh, how can i forget about the plant? There's an invisible thingy. It's not clicking over there somewhere. There's an invisible. No a over here somewhere. Um there's several dead people over here.

02:56

You are future. Future dead people. Yeah. Future dead people. A makeo is going to be fine. A makeo will live. She got the sword but the rest of us may die. Where's grace in token? Uh, grayson was swallowed by the plain thing and then spit out in a cocoon.

03:17

Yeah, he pre. Like, what is it? He yoshied him. He yoshied him. He was worth the Yoshi, too. Isn't how he does it. He tongues him and eats him and then poops him out of the egg. Oh yes, actually. So that's exactly what happened. Yeah, and there was like a cool thing that zero tried to do that would have been really cool but like we didn't have the range or he failed.

03:41

Anyways, i think you got a reroll. Yeah. And that is where we are at and we were like this is going to be long and grueling and some of us will die. So what's pick this up next week and you will? Yeah. I was looking through the looped list maybe thinking, like maybe we have a scroll or a potion of some kind of aoe spell.

04:00

No, just a bunch of grenades. No. Physio was literally our only aoe. It's true that doesn't sound, right. I'm gonna look at it too and that's right because we ended after it's tackling Grayson so it's turn was done. But does anyone have anything like to add to the recap?

04:25

Or we can jump right back in.

04:30

Crazy. I need to find a lot to get ready. Now, my playlist put on some smash bros music.

04:43

I know in our, like, completely lost loose with my sense. In a, in a game when i stopped pulling up Delfino plaza, that's the moment. But like, i don't know that i have just disconnected from reality. I don't know which one it is but it's the did it dance?

05:04

Oh my rice. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Kirby.

05:18

Exactly. Don't think even more recognizable as the fountain of dreams version. Uh,

05:31

Uh, yeah. I can't think of anything that happens. I wish i could install. What's about to happen, but it's okay. Let me give you the full description, though. Now of the creature that erupted through the wall of snow, a fully grown moon flower standing around 20 feet tall. It's massive trunk, uh, four feet or more in diameter.

05:55

The roots extend away from the base and into the stone and soil, making the plant seem well anchored. But the roofs themselves possess and agility that belies the great size of the plant and allows the moon flower to uproot itself. And move with surprising speed. Your angels of the plant are independently prehensile and rise around.

06:15

The large fly trap like head. The crowns stem. Perfect.

06:32

This thing is fucking terrifying. So, i'm just gonna show everyone the big picture again.

06:44

Horrible terrible awful. That is the stuff of nightmares. Yep, for me. Anyways, it wasn't so bad. It's hug was pretty pathetic. Make sure to cut out it horizontally. So we get the deco stick grace and said, bundled up to his chin looking like my real life, son in a cocoon right now.

07:14

Click my leg. Okay. And move out the frost lights turns, followed by cocooned, grayson followed by the plant, and then we get to do something. The plant just went so we almost made them. Yeah, there is bear. The mushrooms get himself out of the the conclude it all can actually because he has improved on arm strike.

07:44

He can attack and deal his own truck damage against him. Does the cocoon take bludgeoning damage? Does the required flashing? Usually swallow, whole type stuff. Needs a slashing weapon. Hold on. Hug prison. This works like the swallow whole ability, except the moon flowering. Once everyone before rounds and the sold creatures, immediately wrapped on a types.

08:13

I just a cocoon and expelled into an adjacent square where it takes damage. Every round 26, budgeting and 2d6 acid. Ac 15, 25 hp. The cocoon target. Cannot use escape artist to get out of the cocoon other creatures can aid the target by attacking the cocoon with piercing or slashing weapons.

08:32

But the creature within takes half the damage from any attack against, of course, once the cocoon is destroyed, it's a plates in its k. Each creature sold by a moonflower is encased in its own. Cocoon are interesting difference. So as the rules to swallow hold though is it slashing damage or is?

08:54

It's flashing damage required like, that's what i think. That's what you're saying. I mean i would think you could still punch stuff, a swallowed creature can try to cook its way free with any light slashing or piercing weapon. You know cutting damage required to get freeze equal to one tens of the creatures total headphones, in this case, use whatever you need for this.

09:17

Month's those stepping? Or i can just try to escape the graph. You can't because it's space. It states specifically that you can't escape artists. You can only uh slashing or piercing your way out racing. You got a dagger. Oh, find out on his turn. Grace and pulls out. Whispering shrike.

09:44

Wait, who has that? Nobody, it's tactically. It could be grazing. I don't think we sold it. Um, recent is the one carrying the bag of holding exactly. So if he can just levitate it out with his mind of the bag while his arms are bound, he can

10:06

Oh, the role in real nice against coyote. We love it. Yeah. I, well, she did just double blast them with positive energy on her turn.

10:19

Uh, this one though is gonna keep attacking ochi.

10:27

I would like to bring up. Now the thing that i forget to bring up every time i have defenses stance active, which is that i have like dr. One right now. They will shit against their teeth. Yeah. So you missed. Anyway, it's good for me. It's in. Please come to you have something very soon.

10:48

Uh still trying to determine that Grayson adopts wolf style and does slashing damage with his own arm strikes.

10:59

I went through like kind of monk, every kind of style feat, trying to find something to do for ochie for fun, and they all were not great. If you're not a monk yeah it's unfortunate side effect. That was quite a lot of styles that are really really cool but you need to you need to be built for them.

11:17

Yeah, there's a lot of prereqs on those bad boys. Got to have that sweet. Sweet. Wisdom, 13. That unarmed strike. So, wisdom prerequisits, so dumb.

11:31

I'm looking up something as fast as i can. That's what your your turn is forever faster than any, one of my turns you're doing fine.

11:44

You can use some ice skates. If you're wearing ice gates,

11:52

I don't think there isn't needed the skates. All right. He has the fancy, uh, shoes or outfit, or something for the the winter weather. I remember? Oh yeah. The boots of the winter lane. Yeah, arrows can be used as a melee weapon, uh, treated as a light improvised weapon until damage as a dagger for its size.

12:11

Heck, yeah. Are they piercing or slashing? I think it's probably piercing right? I think daggers do both. Yeah but i don't i can't see how you could slash with an arrow. Maybe a broad head, crazy with really depend on the arrowhead. That was, yeah.

12:36

All right, get your way out with the narrow. Let's all just this is very on brand for greyson, by the way, angry dwarf, cutting his way out with an arrow. You're going to give me a minute to make an actual attack thing for it. Can we get the magikarp song in here?

12:54

I never listen to the full thing. No, let me the poken tournament. What game is this? That's a good side thing to talk about what grace and builds an attack for its single arrow for it. Again was a pokemon spin-off made for the wii U later ported to the switch that was made by the same developers as Tekken.

13:14

Yeah, it's um, it's a 3d pokemon fighting game, ala ladies, Dragon Ball, Z budokai Tenkaichi, and stuff like that, or like tech in like a fighting game. It's it's mostly it's more like Tekken, like they really tried to make it like a competitive uh like sort of like real fighting game like traditional fighting game fighting game.

13:37

Yeah. Uh, interesting, you guys play some games. I've never heard of i'm i don't play enough games anymore. Speaking up, i'm gonna reinstall the sims

13:56

Figure out how to.

14:03

My music file is too big to throw in the discord.

14:10

And yeah, relisting a magical festival. I'm actually not so certain on it for my rondo song because i forgot just how techno it was like, in my head. It had a lot more uh actual tyco drums in it but it's very much a very much a an EDM song.

14:31

Let's do some uh some housekeeping. Do we have inspire courage on right now? Yeah, that works too. It does it does still work it if it doesn't break immersion for people. I i was a candy kid for like ages. Oh, right. That's how i was gonna do it. I was gonna attach it to your actual thing.

14:51

What the the performance? Where is it? Pleasing rondo. I can attach a sound file to its use should play it. I love foundry. Um, like i was asking, though, did you or do we should we have inspire courage on right now? Uh, no. You have blazing Rondo? They're exclusive to each other.

15:20

Never heard of that. I don't have it on my sheet. Oh, it's the haste. Oh, okay, that works. I do have haste on my sheet.

15:35

How many rounds can you accept it before? It comes critaging three.

15:46

We are on round two. I still have counter makeup my desk.

16:06

She was smile.

16:33

Yo, a damn. I think that should have the minus 4 in it. Yeah, it does. Okay, all right. Well, you plucking a annihilate that cocoon. Yeah, he's solos. The cocoon in one attack. Oh my god, like gracing got swallowed and grazing. God is Grayson just flexed. And the cocoon exploded off of him.

17:04

He knows arrow who like legalis. Why were we worried grace is going to kill like three of these things on his turn? Consume i can remove grappled now. Yes.

17:22

You. Okay, right today is because uh i imagine we will prove up in the same, so he's that's his turn, good job.

17:39

All right, i like it. But how do i turn it down? Actually none of my volume controls are working. Yeah, not a female working. It's a disaster.

17:57

They literally disappeared as soon as you open that. Oh, there it is. I think about after i think this is great. This reminds me of the very first time i use foundry. I can hear that from your side. That's fucking hard. All right. All right. I am youtube.com. Go up to your tabs and view it.

18:15

Yeah, i'm very sorry. I'm thoroughly enjoying this. I guess i shouldn't apologize. It's so fuck.

18:29

To another map.

18:35

I'm sorry. I said anything, guys.

18:44

That bed does not work out at all. Like the holy hand grenade? Uh, this is turning out to be a fantastic session. Okay, everyone hear me. Did everyone use their tabs? I could still hear you. It's still going for me. I'm not hearing anything from from ochi and grayson which makes me worried that we blown their ears out and they brew their mice across the room.

19:21

No, i think i have the global the global market for us while searching for how to turn the volume down. I found the we're to increase the various text size in boundary. All right. Discovery struggling. You. Okay. Yeah. No. It's still playing. I'm vibing. I think there are some church.

19:53

We probably busy right now. Can you guys not hear me? Apparently we've been blown to a totally different. I, i played too hard and exploding the ball once said to fly. No, i thought getting us off. The that active map. The changing the active method. Gets the found. The stuff.

20:19

It did not. It does still going. Oh dear, i don't know how to stop it. I deleted you from the map. You should have been the source of the sound. Can you guys hear me at all?

20:35

Very interesting.

20:41

Oh, um, this course i think i was supposed to take damage at the beginning of my turn from the thing. No, beginning of it started. Oh, okay. Am i speak now, here it was just discord again. It's got nothing to do with foundry the whole time. You guys were like, oh my god, it's blowing out my ears.

21:01

I was like, i like this song i'm vibing to this. We literally just joked about that.

21:14

It's fading. All right. Good girl. It's fading away now. What do you mean the the music's fading away? Yeah, the poking went away. Oh yeah. Yeah, i did maybe it's just taking like a low. What if it comes raging back, that would be really funny. No. What the next time that the next time that choco moves on the map.

21:38

It's just gonna go back. Full volume. No before before i put him back on the map. I'm gonna go and remove the audio file from the ability. That was one of the greatest ideas we've ever had. That was beautiful. It worked out really well. The first time i did it, i made the holy end grenade of antioxide for them.

22:02

Oh, that was great. Okay, and she'll go back on the map keeping their county pipe on theme. The, the police now show up to arrest us all for a noise disturbance. I don't know. That's just a regular music. Okay. Oh, i'm still. They're still an initial. Oh, we had to put show.

22:30

Go back in his original was eight. Yes.

22:41

My movement speed has to be so high right now.

22:47

All right. I am now going to click the button again. It appears to be safe.

22:58

Hey, all right.

23:05

Thank goodness. Okay, i was waiting. Nope. Okay, the frost phantom. Of course, they have blind sight. Why wouldn't they? There's species is invisible.

23:35

No, i please do not get eaten by the mall, bro. Too late and still fight at the through it. We basically like pulled together three or four encounters. All into one. Yes. Um, i want to point out right now, you said that when this creature attacks, it does become visible as it attacks, and then faces back out of existence.

24:01

So i saw the animation right there. Oh i see. Okay, cool. That's all i want to know. That was a very specific reason. I came to this square was to give coya some flanking and kind of draw some heat and possibly help against the mushroom hippo. Yeah, so you know, that's that's right there.

24:28

I hate these things.

24:36

It's kind of funky because there's like a wall there, right? Yeah. There's a little bit of wall there. Okay. Is it like a half wall or is it? Yeah, like height wise? I mean, well, you know it's just it's more like the there's a big hexagonal opening in the wall here that is more opening the wall.

25:00

Oh i see. It's a it's it's denoting. Vertical shape. Not like a wall. Yeah. Gotcha. It is showing us a hexagonal portal, into the hexagonal tower and the center of the hex. Exactly cool makes makes a lot of sense.

25:33

No way how you doing.

25:43

Very bob, um,

25:50

Oh, i hated neither. These things have been hit, right? Everyone for anything. Nope. They have not, i haven't even hit any of these frosty boys.

26:09

Yeah, i don't know. So i think i mayco hit one of the cybermen and one of the cybermen hit Shoko and that's like it. Maybe koya. Hit one of the frosty boys. We're going to try and make the numbers go down a bit fast and this wonderful chat. See me?

26:33

No, he cannot. Okay.

26:39

I'm going to do a breath. I'm actually going to uh gonna activate that big property because ah a fucking heart. Um do you do? I can't really like flanking this house.

27:01

That looks pretty cool. And boom. Boom. Boom.

27:10

And goodbye. Natural armor.

27:24

Then they don't get affected by using strength. I need to actually take lead damage.

27:35

Oh, if this unfortunate leave damage the victim of the sneak attack, second by the time and has its natural armor bonus. If i need to reduce lineup, but it needs to bleed. That's unfortunate. Yeah, fucking sucks. Um and then bleeding segment edition, i know great, they bleed like marrow or something.

27:59

All right, kind of actually like they just sort of start falling apart. No, my bone juice. Essentially, i bonitis

28:13

Um, i also argued scientifically for why a skeleton could be a sorcerer because the marrow in our bones is actually what produces our bloods things to think about next step.

28:33

I don't think that hits doesn't.

28:40

I i don't know. It does not like you because armor away.

28:54

Oh oh, you guys are really low on health. Oh no.

29:03

Yep.

29:07

There's more fucking turns before it gets back to coya. Boom. Boom. At least you have seen visibility. So, you're now five footed against the prosperations attacks, my AC is one higher. I just haven't put the buffet yet. I'm i don't think that's gonna matter with your is. Oh my god.

29:33

Oh my god, every session. So we just have read, this didn't happen and like and just like put off a session until next week when we have our fireballs with us with nobody's here Fireballs. Yeah, we're gonna throw in the middle of it. The ninja has evasion, just you don't Will be fine.

29:59

I mean, the way won't, but we'll be fun.

30:07

I am no, no, you hit me. You rolled you did that attack. Just just go through that. I'm i'm whatever. If it comes out of this, it comes down to business. Fine and becomes visible. Oh gee. You now know where two of them are? We're excuse me. Where? What?

30:25

Two, you heard me. What i did say this? There's that one and there's this one. I did not catch that. Oh no! Oh sweet! God, no.

30:42

Free. So good thing i have on candy. Dodge question mark. Okay, i'll makeo. You're like blessed by like the facts sword. Like, no, she is blessed by she's a room. She just only cares about shayla i'm saying like if there's a moment for her to go like super sand or whatever because she's like the chosen one.

31:09

This would be it. Did you protagonist right now? That'd be great. Did you watch Dragon Ball Z? One of us has to die for someone to go super saiyan. I'm volunteering a parent.

31:26

Please continue. I'm sorry. I'm, i'm sorry, i'm fine. I'm fine with it. I'm fine. It's no way. It's like, please don't break my arms. No. Boom. No is just like eyebrow. Twitching going. I am never using just defending property ever again. We're not doing this.

32:06

What is happening? At least he appears to have rolled poorly on the crit. Oh no. Everybody's gonna invest in like fortification armor and shit after this. Here's the problem though, with the chart as they when they stand still. Oh yeah. Or yeah, that's pretty fucking too. What? The roll the 19.

32:40

And yeah, i see that back. We'll do that. Yes. Yeah. Wow. So out of curiosity, like, can anybody else see? Like a health bar for a mako? No, never. Nope. Yeah, i can see coya and oh, geez, health bar. But i cannot see, i presume that's because we don't have access to version, which is i don't have access to koya.

33:09

She either. Oh, i do i like

33:15

A miko is still up though, and i can actually

33:29

About other two. Just go okay. Two pull it over by everyone. Okay sources. Hover it over by anyone? Nice reality.

33:48

The boom. I may go. Uh so connection they don't have yet. Still can't see one but yeah i think it might be fresh or something. You know, she yield herself for one for one non-leaf, really?

34:17

I can see invisibility now for some reason. Oh, it's because i don't have my token selected. Yeah. Whoops, my bad.

34:34

People tech. Oh my god. Amigo, the plight of paladins everywhere.

34:46

Efficient. Wait, why does she get inspired courage? And does she have it like so that like only she gets her body performance? Is that what's happening?

35:03

Somebody had a buff on what it shouldn't have been on. That is correct. Not that it helped her at all. Remember when i was like, let's do inventory. Does should we have inspire courage on or no foundry? Is too smart for me.

35:27

Sword, that's amazing. Come on, no. Wow! Koya. Get some AC bro. Why is coy as a see? So low. That's because choir has plus one leather armor and it's like 30 of 16, that's it.

35:51

Mood right. Cliff.

35:59

I'm out here trying to frontline and nobody cares. Nobody's attacking me except for these skeletons. But is the only one that's done damage to the whites. That's that you're. Could you lower your voice when you say that please? Hey, no. I just stabbed one twice once it's clear, you did.

36:25

Uh, but now it because turn koi is gonna just channel channel channel. Uh, no coy is gonna save herself from dying.

37:06

Hell yeah. And then koya is gonna channel energy for everyone.

37:30

And wow. Okay. Thanks. Besnah.

37:38

She's busy making gods. She, she busy doing something.

37:49

This is ready. This is the same as when i call my psychiatrist or the pharmacy. Okay, we're not. You are hasted. Your standing still become the dervous. You built your character to be lower your expectations? Please i beg of you. Oh, she is going to use a key point to get even more attacks.

38:15

Did it take one off? Cool. All right. Uh, so we're gonna start with them then. Bonus boys. If you know a extra key attack does not stacked with haste attack. It doesn't that's fine. Okay, that's fine. What we're going to do is we're gonna challenge the one, i just targeted then instead and give myself that key point back.

38:36

So i'm issuing a challenge. I said, why don't you pick on a bird? Your own size to this skeleton? In front of me. Let's go. Where's that at? I have one of those so pretend you never saw that key points. I trust grason. Continue everyone. So, first one for haste.

39:04

So i'm not going to full attack yet because i don't want to make this confusing. Um i get flanking and sneak attack. Question mark, huh. Yeah. Plus 2 for flanking. Where's my challenge? Oh, i bet it's big to buy attack now. We'll just see.

39:29

That's a no.

39:35

Okay, so now we're going to move into full attack land. Which,

39:53

I didn't hit the haste button last time. Of course, i still would have missed god. We're not even paying attention to the public flower. Oh,

40:07

We got one. I don't think you did. I think their AC is 25.

40:21

Yeah, he doesn't have the bus to earth blinking. I did not put it in on that one. I'm sorry. No, but that means you hit. Yeah, so that one does include the four at the bottom for challenge. So, it's 25 25.

40:41

Now, roll my off hands since he's still here. He is still here.

40:57

And didn't play with the plus two for thinking, i'm sorry.

41:08

Oh, that it's and only on the first six. Little text e-trail. Okay.

41:21

So it is still up the total of two hits. Still standing. Fantastic is one age. Feel left. Um, in that case, ochi's gonna take a five foot step there.

41:38

I guess that will be my turn. Okay, go give myself my key point back.

41:48

What?

41:52

That was very helpful. Thank you.

41:58

I'm trying my best, i am but a bird. I am a small bird boy because i went back and checked it into one of those stuff. The hasten. The key point doesn't specify that it doesn't. Well then this was actually have a thing where it says, it does not start with additional.

42:26

This is like gift x. I am going to it and looking at. Now, just to be sure because the ninja went absolutely does not the monk one might because they have three of those.

42:42

I had to, i had to double look it up because the, the reason why it clicked, like, i you sure is because ninjas get access to flurry of stars, which has some interesting combinations with hasters much in the way. Yeah. You can do like, 40 ones, weird, 47, full bb attacks with sherry can if you build for it, it's something garbage.

43:05

But like it's really violently good. But like, who wants to be optimal? Do you want to stay in 10 feet away from someone and throw tiny shards of metal at them? No, right? So, you can get one more attack if you'd like, if you have this way. Well, no.

43:26

Because i took the key point back and challenged instead and that would have been just action. So and i'm happier with that because he's closer to dead man. I may have hit him with another attack but based on what we just saw probably not. So that is still the end of my turn.

43:44

Okay, bring us to shall go. I'm really sorry that i was like we should continue to play today. We probably got this guys. And then i do stuff like that. Okay. I crit against everyone. I rolled against. I'm just waiting for the next crit. I'm sorry. 10 15, 20 provoking.

44:24

I lose one mirror image and now i have a choice of your choices to make here. Do i hop across and risk losing concentration on the spell? I try to cast but also take agro off of coil a little bit or if i stay here and if i stay here, do i try and debuff the skeletons or buff my party?

44:58

Professor really low health? I think, debuffing, the skeletons might be more important. They're doing a lot of damage. Can i ask a question of you, while it is your turn and we're thinking about this on your cool drums thing that you're doing. Uh, abby mentioned, fatigue. If we accept three rounds of it, after it's over, which is three rounds.

45:20

No, no, when when i decide to end it is when it's over all when i drop, um, never the performance ends. Yeah, who gets fatigue? Everyone who had it for more than three rounds. Oh, i see.

45:37

Uh, let me want to go to the measurements real quick. So now that you've moved closer with bracing, get this finally. Um, oh yeah. Yeah. You, yeah, you would absolutely be getting us, okay? Because i don't think i was previously because i think i was out of range.

45:57

Yeah, i can't find anything that i could have sworn. Was there about the extra? He attack doesn't snack. But it apparently Andrew both even with the monk one. Nice, that's crazy. I mean, basically trading this with for an extra attack. So i i find that in agreeable, trade on a lot of turns and it's also like you have to pull attack action, not that it matters for you because you're a shot, you know you're retir it but generally speaking like full attack actions about having contusion so it's it's me right?

46:35

These, um, um, i'm sorry. Uh, abby. I know. I said you won't. I know you said you wanted. Good. Hope for me but like i i need to try and protect coyote here. I don't care what you do. It's your character did rock it. So yeah.

46:58

This is going to hit all the enemies and the three plants though, i don't think they care.

47:11

Dodgeball search bar. Search bar. Yeah. So i can hit undead with it, huh? Maybe the plants are surprisingly sentient. I don't know. Uh, the plant is hello sentient, but it's also a plant. I think the plant is hello sentient. I can't confirm giant bite. Mark inside of pictures. I think it's a little bit tention.

47:34

Yes, just deleted it. Clearly has wants and goals. All right, don't, let's put it that way but but

47:50

10 plus wins. Where's what? Yeah, where big kid dc's in there man. What the heck? The the DCs are variables depending on it. Yes, it's intimidation based issues. So it's oh, boys. Um, and no it's just it's just hit that plus words, right? It was never thought it was 10 plus hit, that was Intimidate, 10 plus size, plus ways.

48:23

You are quite right. I cannot read. So they have a wisdom of 17 and 60 days. So 19, they are demoralized for one plus one. For every five by six. I pass it. The two rounds? Well, no three rounds because it's it's one and then one extra for each side that i pass.

48:50

So one for passing it and then so i made it by 10, it's two years. He didn't impact make it right then.

49:28

And even though i haven't used all my movement, you can't move, cast, a spell and move again. That's the sameest for attacking, right? You need to spell on the run or something. There's probably a feat for that there isn't. Actually the closest thing you can get is a flyby attack which specifies that you can make a standard action at any point doing why really?

49:48

So they they included everyone including like birds in those cool things. Except for spellcasters. I mean yeah, because fellowcast does get to win the game. That's fair enough. Yeah, wine spellcaster, which most of um, you also get access to that for the cost of weight. So yes. All right, that's not true because i have like dodge mobility dex.

50:15

Something b, a b. Something not for that. It's a spring attack. Yeah, but not. Well, that's what i'm saying. For like a shot on the run. Like the Fordya. Oh my god, we gotta remember to pick up a masterwork set of instruments for you to get an extra plus 2 on that.

50:36

As ochi. No i i refuse. Mmm flower.

51:08

What?

51:27

Am i blinded?

51:31

Um, yep. I don't like that. Can you double check? It's it's a DC 20.

51:44

I should have taken the worldwide. God damn it. Don't you have samurai's resolved you have to do it before you roll and i impulsively hit the button. I was like, 19. Sounds good. I'll go with it.

52:02

Without even looking. I'm sure it's as an immediate action. When you were going to make a fortitude or will save, you can roll twice and take the better. You have to use this before? All right. Shell. Go. You win. We are going to die.

52:30

A mako will save us, definitely make those gonna save us.

52:44

So this is like the boss fight of the whole tower, right? This obviously has to be the hardest encounter. This book by on the first floor. This is floor. One of three.

52:59

We're gonna sleep after every floor as in forever, we're going to sleep forever. I thought about it right after just fucking leaderboard starts playing in the backgrounds, you say this. Uh, i would like to partition that if i die here, my character immediately rises as a really fucking angry race.

53:21

Yeah. Uh, that is likely in this area. In fact.

53:34

Least it's probably a written. It's supposed to be perfect.

53:45

Oh, gee Hope she put blind on. I'm working on it. It's just a condition.

54:04

The widths are ac now.

54:15

AC is 21. Hey, you take a sword and the slam. Hold on, doesn't candy doge affect that in any way.

54:30

Gift can be flying. Yeah, okay i guess that's fair. I'm sitting invisible. I was thinking like visible, you know what i mean? The ability to visit them.

54:46

But i'm just gonna go ahead. Snake fly. I took it. I believe. Yeah, you're blind now so you don't put both marking. That's something.

55:01

Um, my vote is run.

55:12

Racing. Yeah, i don't think that backing out of this at this point is out of the question. I don't think it's like backing out. That's a question. I think it's just not predictably possible in summer gods. Oh no. Some of us are going to die but it's it's that or all of us die Grayson is going to fire at that square.

55:40

So, two squares below him. He's gonna literally fair. All round actually folk, you know, flurry blows key shot. Hey, etc. Um, his first two arrows. He's using seeking arrows, which will ignore all, missed checks. Dig it, unfortunately is two of them. So that's that's what you can use.

56:16

Oh, those are not great attack rolls.

56:36

It looks like i've got two missed chances to roll them for arrow, 3, and here.

56:49

Here. Oh, and first zero, first, zero is 28. Well, the first row had the seeking arrow on it. I yes. Okay, then, yes.

57:05

Wow, i guess i need to declare in advance, whether high or low. Um, i will usually declare high so i'm okay with it.

57:16

Okay, well, 2d 100 on that one. Let me roll again.

57:31

Okay. So, first arrow and third arrow. It then if it's a 50 percent miss chance it is indeed that was a solid checker damage sir.

57:48

And pill, he's going to wear, anybody will be moving. He knows if he stays here. He's in range for koias. Um, channels. A few has no idea if she's Five feet to the actually, no, he'll stay where he is to try to prevent that thing from moving past him.

58:13

And yeah, because he thinks he can know where it is, as long as it doesn't move.

58:21

I just added a hit point back for the dr. By the way that i forgot about excellent.

58:30

Comes visible. Fixed by adobochi. Misses. Do i feel that bite? Do i feel him trying to crumb to me? Uh you saw him try to crompt you. I'm blinded. Oh then yes, you felt it. Okay.

59:00

It was the right handsome flesh. I'm asking to see if they moved it all between the two of those mushroom hippos. Oh why would they move? When a birdie just like served itself about, i'm gonna both of them. I'm just trying to have ochi mentally confirmed where all the creatures that may or may not attack him are before his turn, so that he knows if he can swing on those squares.

59:24

So was it that one? Or was it that one that one has been has attacked? You don't know if the other one's still in that spot. Okay, that's what i'm confirming.

59:38

All good. Oh, i'll happen.

59:46

Okay, okay was already called a retreat at this point? Well, i mean i i mean, it's not his turn so he can't really and we're talking about app. Whatever is no a blinded, nope. No, she is not.

01:00:17

Not that fucking belong to thunders first thing. Oh, i heard all of this, there's none of these other things were affected, right? Like they cannot see. So didion really went crit. Crit crit. Blind everyone. All right guys. Good luck. Yeah. It is what it is. I don't i don't have a problem with that.

01:00:38

I'm just trying to make sense of the situation.

01:00:47

Um, i'm hoping that like, it says, somewhere in the page of the adventure module. Uh, when we all there's might run away here after they've gathered the information of the encounter and then they'll be able to do it better. The second time i'm hoping we're not actually meant to just charge in and do it.

01:01:07

Do it, do it. No. What's no? I think, i think what we're supposed to do is like actually get the encounter on the the area back here and fight that like and then move forward and then deal with this. And then maybe after a few rounds we deal with that.

01:01:22

The problem is that nope doesn't look like there's anything around here. No, there's no way you can find out. There's anything going on here. So when you have people with high movement, they just do high movement things. This happen to be half the party. So what actually happens here is, we all die around the spire and then scouting, anything again, is what i'm hearing.

01:01:52

Like, i'm never bothering with this ever again. We're resurrecting. No, it will work. No. It's number one because it won't situation. No, i fully utterly committed to just not caring anymore um as for what to do about this honestly, i don't know. So we're going to try and take us pretty much all the swings like this one option you guys.

01:02:17

Come on. I can't really run when we're blind. They covered when they're blinds. Um, no. I can run and leave all of you to die, but i like to think she's had a little bit of character development since, you know, last time that she tried to cut corner and this would suggest that leaving her in the middle of a bunch of lights as a good idea.

01:02:42

Just putting it out there. Yeah if we were in a place where like there was really sure footing and an easy way to run out maybe but you know the the one way in is really slippery there's gaps in it i would die on the attack about we'll just run into creatures and allies.

01:02:59

Yeah, you would run into a million attacks of opportunity before you even made it to the door. We're not disagreeing with you just to be clear. We're not saying that's stupid. We're saying running was a fantastic option. One turn ago, one turn to go. Absolutely. I would have hit acrobatics and eat it.

01:03:20

Now, it is not an option so we're choosing to die later rather than write this minute. Yeah. So nobody provides planking anymore. So all these attacks, you could have suck but there is very little i can do abouts. So yeah, problematic um, can actually hear those. Yes, i can.

01:03:49

Okay, it's got one more round of this.

01:03:55

So, first swing on the orange juice.

01:04:03

I'm not going to do that because i will actually knock myself out i am here. So i'm going to haste. So this is my main hand.

01:04:19

Yeah, yeah. Everything.

01:04:32

Okay, go off i guess.

01:04:41

I think that's a mess as well. 25. Ac

01:04:49

You you only hit on a on a 15 or higher? I, no, i know you don't have to tell me like

01:05:10

Where's that? Anytime we could have saving finale to all of us. No, it's a creature. One person, you could have chosen Atok and that target could mean say

01:05:30

Uh and then i'm going to use my swift action to can. I actually do this, pretty sure i can.

01:05:49

Nope, that's in three levels. Gotcha, measure the fucking take them. The cleansing masterpiece.

01:05:59

So it goes.

01:06:11

So it goes. Um, sure how to have a host attack for giggles by which, i mean key point, all right? No, it doesn't line us. Nope, we were hot. There was nothing we can do.

01:06:39

There you go.

01:06:52

First, the phantom.

01:07:04

Tech supply out of ochi, yes, it does.

01:07:16

How was that? Blind was for i assume just enough. Nope, three rounds. Practically practically, yes.

01:07:32

And,

01:07:40

And try to remains engaged in epic combat with the wizard. So blind doesn't actually impose an attack penalty. It only imposes concealment.

01:07:55

Right creature cannot see you take a negative two to honor class lose your dexterity. As long as you can take, a minus 4 penalty on most strength and 30 based skill checks and unapproached skill checks all checks and activities that rely on vision, automatically fail. All the phones are considered to have total concealment.

01:08:12

You do not take any further penalties other than like if you try and move then you have to do like an acrobatics. Yeah it doesn't say attack it only mentions the bit about concealment less time to believe that strength and dexterity-based skill, checks includes attacks which i do not think it does.

01:08:35

Who did the charter bite? A mako bid bite the mako. So using dodging panache, how we actually is who evade it omegos, such a badass the way you built her.

01:08:59

And then he loses the rest of his motherfucking attacks.

01:09:06

Did he and playing chess against himself? You didn't see this coming.

01:09:17

Actually, don't normally like doing this. Why? I limited it to NPCs. Yeah, he's actually nothing stopping. You just fighting most of the caravan to join you. No. It's, it's so much. This more fun this way.

01:09:46

You guys should just bench OG and bring sandra to every fight.

01:09:57

But then we miss out on all the commune with bird shenanigans.

01:10:15

14 more. I love it in hp left.

01:10:29

Why did not take any healing? Really somebody finally died. You're currently going through. What i like to call the player regret phase. Please don't. Oh she can't see anything but he can magically detect a blood splatter out on the bridge. I was wondering how grayson knew i was like how do you know?

01:10:52

There's no target or anything and that i looked and there's the giant pool of blood that and the the in the combat tracker, the name goes red. And oh yeah, i see that. Now who did the frost white attack? Oh yeah, it's going down. Nope.

01:11:23

How turns can koi keep herself alive like this? Uh, she has three more of those. Oh, dude, she's fine. She's like a druid in World of Warcraft. She's just gonna stand there. And no one can kill her. Why? Let's figure it fucking die already. Coy is gonna go out for him and just dip out of here, she's gonna move it's just gonna move action channels the damage.

01:12:09

Oh, my target dies? Hell yeah.

01:12:25

Just out of curious because i kind of realized that i just healed them. Oh my god. Uh actually, which one made the saving throw? Did she damaged the one that i had challenged? But the one that she that you had challenged guys sick, So is the one light post thing now that i'm thinking about it because i recognize that a bunch of people went blind, but where is the light burst thing moonflower?

01:12:59

Did that originating from there? Ish or like there the light pulse, as a standard action, the moon flower can release a pulse of bright light solar flare. Yes. Actually all creatures within a 50 foot burst that can see the moon flower must make a DC 20, 40, 50, 50 50.

01:13:29

I couldn't see it. I wasn't blinded then. That's where were you totally bear right here. It is a 50 foot burst. Not a 50 foot spread? Yeah, you would. In fact, be productive from the blindness. No, i'm still blind. Make me blind again.

01:13:55

Cam. Good. I clicked on my character accidentally deselected. Oh, g. And yeah, those booklets are just straight up as blunt. They yeah, they're supervisible but that's okay because the order that i was going to go in. Anyways, was to try and pull these, uh, mushroom hippos off of no way because i don't hear koya.

01:14:16

Screaming death. Rattles yet. So let's try this again. We're gonna key point once again. No kit Korea is actually probably like sounding scarily determined. Okay. So swing here and here because i oh she knows that that one is still there and he thinks and he thinks that that one is still.

01:14:42

There it is. There's no way say that no way. Is that one's still there up? There we go. Oh, she's gonna attack those two squares. Uh, i have several extra attacks so i'll roll the extra ones first.

01:15:03

Oh, i get anything cool now.

01:15:12

That's the that's my key point one.

01:15:20

That's my haste one. Those are horrific.

01:15:27

What do i have a negative level? Who negative loved me? I forgot i was going to take off defensive stance but we're committed now. So now we're going to full attack. It's just that just five feet closer to who to me so that i can get you all with good hope already started attacking.

01:15:50

But if i hit something, i might think about that kind to remind a bit can't buy. Put step while you blind, you can't. That's not very kind. It is movement. Everything is considered difficult to rain for you, and they also requires you to do an acrobatics check. You're fired.

01:16:06

Blind colors. You're fired very sugar. I can't get any closer. There's a flower in the way who knew. Greyson's, weakness was. Oh, i no, no, no, okay. Oh she and all they are exactly what in the flying, fuck, dude.

01:16:30

I guess i was just never gonna hit anything, huh? All right. Don't understand what's happening tonight. He's blind. Oh wait. No, no particular map has been. I took six attacks and hit nothing.

01:16:52

Okay. Oh, she's gonna stay there. In fact hoping that. No way could step around him and possibly get out of here with her vision.

01:17:09

So that's OG stern. All right? Choco.

01:17:18

Everyone go. Give up, even though i just said, we should probably give up. It doesn't find Apollo but show go violently decides to to just blow caution of the wood uh good hope to everyone except for grayson unfortunately he's too far away and then she'll go. We'll leap across the bridge to space off with this.

01:17:44

This white here.

01:17:51

Oh okay. So going into box, uh, I i think good hope is its own buff. It is, it is okay.

01:18:11

We're just gonna say that the wizard and the chart on neutralized each other. That's very kind of you. I he was your young child.

01:18:30

Video and exploded. I yes, they they karmic strike each other. They're both unconscious at the end of the bridge. The charter said the wizard's unconscious. It's handled is absence, is explained the way. All right. There's one less monster and turn now. Who does the flower yoshi?

01:18:58

I mean that is a very good question. Uh, let's see if it actually noticed grayson escaping from the pod. Let's talk about. So it blinded us, and it is now back to its turn. So that's one round of blindness. Or does it count on our turn? Uh, this one around the brook blanket.

01:19:26

And uh, he can't actually Yoshi anyone again for a couple around more rounds. Yes for approximately as long as we are blinded. So, when that runs out, he's gonna yoshi him again. Blind us all again. Uh, no being that they are fairly intelligent. He is going to take his two tentacle attacks.

01:19:55

At your your cleric? No, stop that. Holy.

01:20:12

Uh, koya curses is russian as she struck. Don't i look like the scariest thing to the whites? Considering i i frightened them. New demoralize them, you haven't been pummeling them to death with the holy light of desna whilst repelling all of their attacks with healing power, okay?

01:20:43

Hello, that was the moonflower.

01:21:05

My goodness and unfortunately confirmed. I wish i rolled like that. I wish i didn't, i wish i could give you my roles.

01:21:24

Good racing. You're barely certain the plant has not moved.

01:21:40

Well, i finally remembered something i could do about the blindness, but that's either i waste my turn to get rid of it. Uh, slightly earlier, but i won't get to attack. All right, monk stuff. I mean, you'll, you would only get one extra turn of not being blind, if you did that.

01:22:01

Yeah, he ran the numbers on that one. Yeah, i should have used it last turn because grace it knows one spell and it would have been useful bark. Still just attack. No. Besides first.

01:22:28

Um, and i think you said 21 was the magical number. So anyone is like first arrow, third arrow, and he still so three uh t100 and i'll go high as usual.

01:22:55

All right, two kids. So, third arrow and hay stereo. So another 43 damage.

01:23:06

The moonflower lets out a weirdly shuttered like streak as the entirety of its trunk vibrates and undulated turning and realizing that you were free of your coon

01:23:23

Here you pedaly, bastard.

01:23:32

Bundabar. Here's something. I probably should have asked on my turn. How much concealment do the invisible mushroom hippos? Have against me. If i'm also blinded still 50 percent, still busy. Pathfinder rules are well, the idea is is that you couldn't see them while they were invisible. And now you just can't see anything.

01:23:57

So, what does it matter? Yeah. Apparently they're gonna roll like shit. Um, what are the rules for taking something out of someone else's pack? Because i know koya has all the wands of healing and shooko, has a ridiculous use magical device. It's a lot, a lot of actions.

01:24:19

I mean, not actually that heart since coyote, wears the ones on her belt and you're not blind, it must be nice.

01:24:32

No way. Okay, i got this is my last round of being able to actually see these fucking things. So, we are going to play the blender game.

01:24:52

Land a game please. Please cooperate.

01:25:17

Oh,

01:25:21

This is why good. Hope is good, it's three plus two, it negates all of my penalties. Thank you very much. Um, is two.

01:25:40

And this is for the offhand tech.

01:25:50

Should just make this one, but that messes. Who unfortunately swift? Jesus. Okay, that makes up for noise. Bad luck today. God, boom. Hey, you just needed to raise her home. She needed that little little boost. Oh, cure from the most depressed kitchen i have ever seen. Yeah. And now if you if you look at me you will find that.

01:26:28

She is uh covered in, whatever. Viscera, this thing has, and is probably doing a very good impression of like an extremely pissed off. Yokai. Just,

01:26:46

And, yeah, and we're gonna not do any of the sensible movement things because i don't want to do that right now. No, actually, he's dead. So you just killed him. The heat is not get a turn. Amigo. On the other hand. I'll make those also hopeful right now. She was within range.

01:27:45

Also a hasten.

01:27:55

Oh, she's been doing this entire combat without case. He has actually. So that is why unfortunate. Uh, so she's gonna use my evil again on him.

01:28:54

Plus 14.

01:29:10

Plus 14. And another point of fire damage the vulnerable require. So 15.

01:29:24

I'm gaily silver and cuts one down. Okay. She's everyone everyone's blind but shoko and oh actually no way that was probably the coolest thing she's done so far.

01:29:45

Holds up a shaky wakizashi, with a thumb up.

01:30:04

It's the same, these things don't have eyes, i'd love to just, you know, steal them.

01:30:13

Oh no appliance no, no she does not. I don't know why she has the plant targeted.

01:30:27

Boy, is just really against deforestation.

01:30:34

Mmm. Yeah, we'll go with that. And then she channels to heal. Stop being your girlfriend for fine. Fucking, are you fucking kidding me? That's none. Again, that's not it doesn't that's not the back to the table.

01:30:57

Well mayo, you're good fine.

01:31:11

All right? And that's that's our turn OT comes by the table. Salt base. Healing explains. Nothing leaves.

01:31:22

Just figure it out if it's meant to be. Oh, she's still big mad. And is gonna do fucking like six attacks on this one. Do we still have haste? Yes, you could do like six attacks on this one. Mushroom hippo. I think, uh, he's gonna ask no way, is there still any around me before?

01:31:42

So there's plausible that he knows that there's only one there. You feel a first like on your back, is it to push you forward for like yes. Oh, she understands the message.

01:32:00

Thought were a bird brain.

01:32:08

Oh my god. I forgot to take off defensive stance. I do this every goddamn time, it, it doesn't really matter. Let's, let's get those to hit rolls their bosses all of those heads. Okay? So six 50 percent concealments because i can take a five foot step as a part of this too and go over and do some whites if we want to know, i can't never mind.

01:32:29

No, no five foot steps. You're hurting my feelings, 1d. This is important for me later for when i start blinding things. Oh my god. Okay, i'm gonna call them all high and then we're going to do that again. Like i know what i'm doing, is it? Our slash one even 100 or roll, slash.

01:32:45

Once you can just click the choose 10 sided dice. They're on the end the bomb and it'll it'll auto drop them into the chat for you. Click in the chat box and row. Okay? I'm calling them all high. Oh my god. It was that was six my friend.

01:33:13

He rolled six it hit miss, miss miss miss miss.

01:33:24

I'm gonna say the great it though, and this bit,

01:33:39

Roaming your next three attacks. Oh, actually the big little miss anyways, from the concealment.

01:33:54

You cut it up. Good though. Thank you. So two of those here, it's not dead. That's what i'm gathering. It is not dead but you have helped it. Yay. Okay, that's what she's turn. Be good.

01:34:17

Still go the picture of just OG just swinging wildly in front of him.

01:34:27

Um, Circle will five foot step, and take a full attack action on this plant. Do i have my phones? I don't think i do actually. Now this fall attack the work pull effect. Yes as well. Yeah, and i will do 13 damage to the plant. Though you will and the plants had that was rotated and looking down a grace in kind of like flops over backwards and looks down at you now.

01:35:07

Um, high. I don't i don't speak plan. I'm sorry i didn't do my one extra attack for key but we'll just pretend that it missed. Oh, oh. And i get one extra attack for uh for paste. Right. Different.

01:35:28

You just gotta click on haste, by the way, and pull attack. Yeah, on the bump on his like, would you like your attack thing? There's a check box for haste and automatically adds a full b, a b attack to your roles. Oh, if you hit the full attack button, a 17 does not got a 21 easy.

01:35:57

It's a moonflower, that's one more round of the blindness facts that is one more round of the front blindness facts. But it's rounds of having another ability.

01:36:28

No, no, no, no, no. No, no. No, no no no.

01:36:34

Uh, it rolls to see if it hits one of my three images. Oh wait. No it doesn't does it. It has fucking blindsight. Boom. It, it has hug site. It doesn't have blindsight unless i'm missing something. No, this is very important information. It has blind fight.

01:37:10

And dark vision and lowlight vision. All right, then it rolls to see if it hits one of my images.

01:37:20

To move. Boom. So your three minutes away, right? We will call you one or

01:37:32

One of the great things i love about your images is they can be quite gruesome when they're killed.

01:37:42

With spell effects. Bubba bomb. But that was the moon flowers turn.

01:37:53

This white.

01:38:01

And he's trying to fuck up koya.

01:38:32

Looking at this looking moonflower, i just see the fucking, um, uh, lazy lawns from ff14. So here's all. There's a boss thing for him. Everything.

01:38:57

Oh my uh looks like three possibilities again.

01:39:09

Well, the last one hits a list.

01:39:21

But that's okay. Think even with fast. Healing five. Oh nope, it's a negative. 19 negative 15, it's got 16 does the blindness go away? Now that it's been three turns of miners at on its turn on eastern not actually dead and it doesn't bleed like that. Those are just the tomatoes on vines.

01:40:24

There we go.

01:40:30

Frost phantom. Fights nochi jesus christ.

01:40:40

Why you just can't?

01:40:46

Yeah, that's fine. That happens, i guess. Is. Don't you still up? Oh, she has enough hit points to be alive standing on his feet.

01:41:18

Um, no way. Let me just adjust that back up for the dr.

01:41:43

Let's try and get rid of this thing.

01:41:51

I did that cookie down.

01:42:21

Action. Jesus.

01:42:31

Um,

01:42:35

While i'm eating your ones at least.

01:42:47

A whole bunch of misses.

01:43:03

Now, i can see it any.

01:43:09

If i had been smart, i'm just done what i should have done. Every time which is spend the resolve the roll twice and take the better. I probably could have beat that blinded DC and i would have got six a hits on. He would have also beaten notified from a good hope.

01:43:28

And so that my asthma thread just i've done, there's been a lot going on over here in the two weapon, fighting department on this side of the map guys. That's all i'm saying, yep. That's the dice for you. Yeah, that's all i got.

01:43:51

Well then you would have been over there's stabbing right now. What is a spy v that's spivey spiffy? You don't remember spiffy. It's really. Why is he here? Because the bm's also, you know, out of the darkness, just the little, how much moving did she have? Okay, she made it all the way up here, grace.

01:44:20

And you were in that. Oh, because coy is almost dead again. Yeah.

01:44:31

That's just for me.

01:44:37

80 foot flight speed. That's right. It's busy claims out of que as bags. So i'd like to ask how spiffy got here. Tell us a story of how spirit he came to be near us. Just now spiffy came to be like most of the other NPCs, sitting off to the sides of these maps and let me.

01:45:00

Well, i'm just picturing this world of warcraft style and like this is like no more gone. Where spiffy jumped down and dragged. He'll you'll see if you look down here a list of available NPCs. Actually, i won't i see blackness, no, yeah, no we won't. Oh, excuse me. But uh, yeah i'm just picturing Spivvy pulling the entire undead, horde around the spire into this fight.

01:45:27

Also for one channel energy. Well, looking really funny like baby is a little rocky and she was never seen. Yeah, i just want to make sure there was some stealth or invisibility or like just drop straight down out of the sky. You know, with a fly maneuver. After traveling here at very high altitude, not very helped.

01:45:55

You remember after about 20 feet up the winds get really intense. Okay. Yeah, stippy does pretty much dive bomb through the doorway out of nowhere. Uh, another anyone. But amigo and show go. See her yet. Oh, she just feels good and he goes. Thank you koya. Hey, well, i imagine that's been these channel divinity.

01:46:23

Feels different because somehow, uh, they both worship. I was literally gonna be like nose. Baby is just tiny. Koya, is just tiny square. Yeah. What is? That's so popular. I've never making a fucking dozen because everyone's a fucking. Doesn't i have a dozen in my back pocket. That does none is a monkey.

01:46:46

It's because, uh, they have the best song. Every god has a song and does is on the road. Again, my destinian is a complete bars. Singer of the series serious singer, but whatever. That's called, i can't remember right now on the road again. Yeah.

01:47:12

Just can't wait to get on the road again. Oh, she's gonna take some some perform. He's going to invest skills into perform, so we can have a band and we'll play shows everywhere. We go fix the tag. Oh, she's gonna play bass. He is gonna use her last night evil.

01:47:46

We could be like, babymetal the stamped the gun back out of this never mind. This is going to be racist. Um, okay, never mind. The mako did the requested. Super Saiyaning.

01:48:05

God damn.

01:48:12

Cool, very good. Thanks princess full's, facebook directly onto the ground. So there's still two creatures, there's still the plant which is like regenerating and then the other plant, which is invisible. You're very easily rolled twice as many crits in this fight. As we have, did you? I know i just went encounted.

01:48:35

I'm like there's no way it's not more than double ours, not to mention. We missed on a great deal of them.

01:48:44

Yeah, the it's it is it is a little a little and the three dm, pcs are performing so much better than the party. He's just, i will it's i'm just commenting on these fucking heels. I was only commenting on dice rolls, all of the npcs are built better than.

01:49:05

Oh, she is. I will say.

01:49:12

I was immediately denied. Sneak attack. Yep. That was that's it. I gotta i did not platform. Was i wrong? Did you guys actually kill one in the prostatums? Uh noi. Did i believe? Yeah, i just fucking i'm so sorry on these heel rolls. Do you have given us enough mercy?

01:49:44

This is just the numbers. This is the game. This is what you were playing, okay? So and right, so you know how there's like that one trait that is first to run rate, where like surrender says, if you roll ones on your channel energy, roll them as use. Yes.

01:50:01

Yes. You know, have you considered just briefingers? Because there's no doesn't show up like it all doesn't works a remote job and has one of those programs to make her mouse. Always look like it's doing something that's not untrue, so she can be traveling, doesn't, his name should be felicia.

01:50:32

She's always going somewhere. Bye felicia. All righty ochie. I'm still blind right? Until it's you are still blind and there is one still alive next to you. Oh she's gonna call out. Is there? Anybody left still one plant, Bob. Just, uh, no way. Just puts her foot back on his back and just pushes him again towards the same.

01:51:05

The same one. This is the kick from down here was like, a full-on forward. Like, you know, kind of trying to knock in a doll kick. This one is just like a roundhouse like that way again nerd. Okay. Oh cheese. Oh, she's just gonna swing. Oh, you know what i am gonna do.

01:51:27

We're gonna take off defensive stance. Oh, getting spicy here. Yeah, we're gonna we're doing serious business now and then we'll do a bunch of attacks. I'm not going to spend the key point.

01:51:57

How many hits do i get? How many um, rolls i need to do. Uh, they have a 19. So one, two, three, four, five.

01:52:15

Okay, i was gonna call hi again and i'm still going to stick with that. So, two of them attacks numbers, three and four. Oh, and boop. Still alive. Let me guess it is still alive. Fantastic. This is great. Nope. Phantom stop. Um, and the note she's gonna continue to stand there because he still can't take a five foot step and that's my whole turn.

01:52:54

Um, so is uh, this regenerating we're right in front of you. Yes. Okay. Um, how do i stop it from regenerating? Well, it's just knowledge traveling. You know that. Oh, fuck my life. You know what? It never had that to begin. Like this was a weekend. Moon flower. I hadn't eaten in a while.

01:53:17

Oh, it was also apparently supposed to have the air 10 flashing, it was whatnot, established killing. It's not actually regeneration.

01:53:33

I finished known that. That thing didn't have blindsight much earlier. That would have made me much happier. Nobody rolled knowledge, anything. We all just cried the whole flight. I don't have the knowledge to do that, frankly. And that's it's on me. Like i i'm i don't actually have a problem.

01:53:54

Shoko, wasn't even bother with rolling knowledge. Checks one small problem that i will voice after this encounters over. I have a question. It's a very important question and i would like to know the answer to it, she'll go was rolling knowledge to tactics the information that he was getting was leave leave now even leave.

01:54:12

Now. Okay, you put it out with misery? Yeah, we have no, right to still be alive so you didn't even need to be. I'm just gonna call the fan from dead. I okay, the performance ends and you are all immediately fucking exhausted. No. Oh, she's gonna spend one of his resolves to not feel exhausted to not feel fatigued.

01:54:44

Uh, we are, we are fatigued for 10 rounds. No. Oh, she chooses. Not to be cool norfolks facebook. So i have to ask offline goes away after one more round. How does the undead knocked out blinded?

01:55:05

It honestly slipped my mind because it would have been very important because i would have gotten all of my sneaker attack. That's true. That is the actions. I would have done so. Oh, she's gonna turn and look at everyone and say, oh thank god. You're all alive. I wish i wasn't spiffy.

01:55:27

When did you get here? I really fucking wait. Had a feeling things weren't going well. So i decided to fly by a feeling. Huh, is OG walks out over here and tries to call out for zeo and see if zio's still alive. Uh zero is an equator earlier. Yeah, the creator.

01:55:59

That's fantastic. Wow. So um, number to action figure of geometry in that post, Oh, i was trying to serious was gone now. Oh, all right. So no, i was about to say no more jumping. Stop jumping. Grace said, oh, she walks up to grace and it puts his head on the shoulder.

01:56:27

It says please no more jumping. A thing of yeah, somewhere. I don't see you. Moving to see. So um, should i be worried about this and she'll go check out to be black crazy. That is clinging to his fucking clothes. Yeah, i really don't like great haciugi. What's uh what's going to happen to him?

01:56:52

Neurotoxin and muscle at your feet. Isn't it? Neither of those sound good. Like a poison. Oh well good hope it's one minute per level. Yeah, very fucking god. But on the charter.

01:57:19

Options me, man. All created about. Okay, i got this negative level off. One of those whites didn't i, you did. Oh no. You have the black slush, didn't you? Yeah. Yes.

01:57:37

Look at dip in the forbidden, the forbidden kiddie pool and they don't drink the forbidden slushie. Okay. Oh, she's gonna walk back around the coya and put his hand on her shoulder and say thank you. We would all 100% be dead several times over. It's not for you.

01:58:07

My god's aren't in the interest of mercy as a general rule, but i'm gonna be honest, i'm thinking of converting at this point. Oh, there's no would be happy to accept you and then needs to turn up to the fucking table first. No, it pulls out. Her shuriken is like, look, i already have star knives.

01:58:30

Boom. Uh how long it doesn't give out duration.

01:58:49

Oh, g drags Zio's. Body inside the tower and gives him a senzu bean. Oh,

01:59:02

And because no one in their right mind would take a fucking dip in that slush. Again, one of the charters had their treasure in a sack on their waist. I was gonna say now that show goes been exposed, he he would probably be the one to don't go diving for the stuff.

01:59:23

Yeah. It's like, oh, i drank a capful of bleach. I could probably just drink a cup full, why not? Yeah. Yeah, no one is there. Right? Mind would jump back in that shit. It's just it doesn't make anything sense. What was it like, what did it taste? Like it.

01:59:39

Tasted like dying. Oh so it tasted like fireball. So what what is this? That is, is it actually poisoning i can't remember. We had this conversation. It is a poison as neutralized poisoning can get rid of it. Uh, it gives a minus one penalty to ac and on attack.

02:00:03

Roll a commutative one really and you make a check every hour. Wonderful medium. It's immediate onset also. Koya. Neutralized poison, as soon as she becomes unblinded, she's had it prepared ever since Raven's. Craig coyos. Still blind. Very nice. Okay. So it's gone. Yes, quit. How are you feeling? I feel like you've expended a lot of mental and magical resources on that.

02:00:39

That fight. I did. Yes, i am going to synthesize the shit down the bad poison. That's very useful. I will give you actual exhort then by next session. I mean, no, that's bad. This would be a hintest thing where to ever fall into civilizations, completely bent over, leaning all the way down trying to just and just trying to scoop a little bit up, like come up here.

02:01:12

Why? She's like off of you. Yeah, she pulls up of you and then has has like tied a small string to another vial that she's just feeding down into the slushes. Like it would be horrible. If this were to end up in civilized hands, she says, squeegeying it if you wanted so badly, i can always just push you into the stuff.

02:01:36

Let's bring out your shirt. Shoko. I could always just stop you too and i haven't managed to do that yet sugar.

02:01:48

Description over here. Okay. Please youtube, pale white mushrooms grow in confusion along the walls of dark room, pumping out of drifts of wind blown snow and the other one that had the moon flower is funny, enough called alien visitor, the tangle of roots and leaves covers. The floor of this chamber dusted with snow and ice that have blown in through the room's, open portals.

02:02:20

Hell yeah. If i want to burn some of my care potions. What do i just going to ask for the the one? But of course it has. Oh i guess i got it. Just ask for a few charges from that while we're resting from but nonsense and getting rid of the exhaustion.

02:02:48

Well, that was a great warm-up. So we show we get back to it. Oh, gee just starts crying a little bit. Yes. Yes, we've never seen a bird crime. You should continue on.

02:03:07

I can murder everything in this building, right? Oh. Oh. I would be, i would be disappointed if you didn't. Could i have some consensual wanding also? Yes. Yes, here's for OC. The 11 was for me. The 11 and then.

02:03:44

Then 13.

02:03:49

Keep it coming.

02:03:56

Another 12, that's probably good. No way.

02:04:07

Just going to go clockwise.

02:04:17

He's looking around and then looking at her one slightly learned spiffy. You're not you're not gonna say anything about any of this to everyone. Back at the caravan, are you? Um, i might stand through, uh, just because he worries about all of you and he will worry even harder on hearing this one.

02:04:41

I mean that's totally fair and all and she pulls out a tiny scroll and reads it in touch. Your touch is grayson.

02:04:53

Yeah. Perfect reasons. That pool i'll show go is going to peer out like across the, um, just across the plains and see it for the commotion, brought any of the army this way, considering heavy bra, any of the army this way? No, no, it's not spiffy. I'm worried about.

02:05:20

It's a show, goes bartic performance. I'm worried about the poking battle theme. I am not like whatever skeletons were closest to the entrance. Just started hearing magic card festival and we're like uh no. They they're mindless undead and wouldn't be able to discern it. I think differently than the sound of thunder also, it's very windy and loud.

02:05:43

And frankly, we don't know whether or not your sound of carry that far on the wind, so about this negative level koya. I'm not feeling very well. Even though most of my vitality has returned, is there anything to be done within the grace of desna about this? Not here?

02:06:07

Not in the time that we have. I recommend crying. I ochi to your still streaming down his face. It's not working. No, it's not with you on this land. It's just like, yeah, but i know. Um, oh yeah, i would like to apologize for suggesting that we all uh, what's he out?

02:06:34

So aggressively. No. Oh no. We will be capable of staying in. Even the most tires circumstances. I think our mission. I think i speak for all of us. What do you say apology accepted?

02:06:56

To see now at ticks her glasses as potatoes can. Oh, thank you. Just continues laughing just like, oh, apology accepted. Oh my god. Here. Two hexagonal openings in the north inside, exit, this 20 foot wide, hexagonal chamber. This room has no ceiling. Instead forming a smooth wall shaft that rises through the towers interior.

02:07:30

A crackling blue sphere of energy. Hangs in the air high at the top of this happen. Let's say how many feet up ish. The crackling spear of energy. Yeah, i'm sorry. Um like 340 feet before we continue. Do you think we could take our break here? Yeah. Let's take our breaker.

02:07:56

I gotta go to them. Oh my god. Fucking funny. I need to confessions apology accepted.

02:08:14

Oh, that was fantastic. That's a great fight snack time.

02:08:26

Riley, where are you doing? Or are you coming to me? No retreat. Yeah.

02:09:41

Huh.

02:10:35

Heavier is a magnets here. I heard it. Dread some that just doesn't. No. Okay, no.

02:10:55

While we're still waiting for magnets. I am enjoying dewdrop far more than i expected. I would do dope, is is entertaining it? That's that party. Is gonna be gonna be a very good laugh. I think.

02:11:22

Yes, one of those. Charter was caring just carrying around 3400, gold worth of uncut diamonds.

02:11:42

Like diamonds.

02:11:48

Goodness gracious. Magnus this hot tan is rapidly turning into a scorching 20.

02:12:21

Very well, we shall resume.

02:12:27

Seeing everyone's reaction to his, his comment, it varies. I assume that you guys and we'll follow it up with that look like he'll kind of like it's probably tactically the right call on here back there. But, you know, the situation didn't really allow it plus, you know, it like i'm a follower of Rory.

02:12:46

And it's all about like bettering yourself. She just gotta, you know, like see a situation and improve to be able to overcome it. You know, we some people are thinking we were gonna die. When we fought came in dotsu other stuff, we were gonna die with the dragon. And look, we're all still here.

02:13:08

Thank you koya. So just you miss 100. I just have to make yourself better than you. Just were you. Miss 100% of the shots. You don't take shoko. Okay? Not here. We know we're still working on that same thing. Why is, why is no way have three feet of elevation?

02:13:30

And she's still been in the tree this whole time. Since like, no way. Those was three rounds of blindness. Oh, i was about to say, i am not creepy. Just levitating spiffies five feet in the air. God, i wish i had levitation, could you imagine? I've never have to, i've never get hit by fucking tremor, sensing assholes anymore, maybe with her 80 foot.

02:13:57

Perfect fly speed, just sort of like looks at you. All right, i'm back. Well, this doesn't want to give me that. No, yes, actually. I can instruct you on how to become a sear walker. If you'd like yes, apology accepted shoko. We we must always push ourselves is what grace and was saying.

02:14:18

Do you want to learn to fly? Yes.

02:14:27

I'm sorry. I'm a bird that can fly. Oh, this is a great day. See oh, she's already pushing himself to be better. Exactly.

02:14:38

Ask me again when i'm not actively in murder mode. I let us away. So did we see stairs? No, you did not uh, the right here. You know that you are looking about uh you see what looks like a flat plane of crystal attached to a, don't pedestal. The crystal plane is slightly bent backwards.

02:15:08

Almost appearing like a podium of sorts like a lectern. More like um, builted that screen? Yes. Oh, she's gonna look at it and turn his head. Very bird like and the ask if anybody makes sense of this, if anybody's seen anything like this before.

02:15:41

Takes off. Glasses squints. Uh, you may because it is magitek rolled disabled device or use magic device to operate it. She'll go get up here. Oh, it's new iPad 2. Well more like the five thousand some odd year old ipad too. So this was 2011. I just so it's the first iPad doesn't have flappy bird installed flappy bird.

02:16:17

Oh my god. I heard disabled device. So the only question i'm gonna ask you. Is this going to somehow explode? If shogo has good UMD. Also though, let's not forget. I don't doubt that i'm just asking if my fat flat plus 25 tells me it's going to explode. Uh no.

02:16:38

Actually you feel kind of confident that you can operate this? You have seen similar magitech devices uh that occasionally come out of both the north and numerica ninja training school, way through magnemar ninja training. School is hybrid half at home and half it all. Location magma. Yes, she did.

02:17:00

Most of her training in magnanore which is a huge, very human tropolis. Uh, but no, i does not say this aloud. She's just taken off her glasses and there's like chewing the, uh, the stem of one of the legs. He passes you, but it won't explode, says nothing. And puts her glasses back on and let's show her table.

02:17:18

Look. Oh, she passes you the tengo drinking jug.

02:17:25

Oh, let's see what i recent next, as a degree soon, get a, get a lap, go, and i think we all need a drink. Let's kill me very soon. Takes a swig and then spits it up. It's like ah, what is this plum? Licker gross. Whatever you wanted to be my dude.

02:17:42

Tea plum liquor socket. All three of those. You would think were gross. What the uncultured? He takes his job back. Is it to a mako? How do we send back this book? He's broken. All right. I've never been to minkai. How would i know any of this stuff? Okay, i'm gonna ask you an out of character question.

02:18:05

If you've never been to japan, but you eat some sushi or you're going to think it's disgusting. No. But uh Grayson is not me. I know, i'm just saying. All right. Oh, i'll shut up. It's a good character note. I liked it. I was just words were quite stygy about their liquor.

02:18:23

Most of the time, it's it's like the american men who are always dead set on drinking beer, even though i was literally about to be like a low alcohol content and tastes like garbage. Like what is this flavorful tip? My amma. What does this tasty? Get this. The fuck away from me.

02:18:42

I mean, you guys trying to get him to drink sake back at the? No i remember. Yeah. And he tried it and it was like, uh, nothing. Oh she mostly uses it to drink tea, but he has just been crying quite a bit. So i think he was going for the plumb with cooler this time, vodka, so don't go.

02:19:00

You place your hand on the crystal and a bunch of geometric, arcane, which is there by the light up light up underneath your palm. Uh, and you understand that this activates a plane of force on the ground floor and a tiny hut over the platform that will then, raise you up to the next level.

02:19:25

You also have the faintest idea that the platform will not remain for long at the next level. So, you will have to get right off of the elevator.

02:19:40

This thing will make a basically a floor that'll carry us up to the top, uh, or at least one floor and we'll have to hop off immediately because it'll disappear on from under us afterwards.

02:19:57

Come on. All baby. Are you coming with us? Are you heading back any of the feeling i should stick around and Disney usually gives me right feelings. Really. Oh, i'm gonna stay at that. Train is my purpose would be revealed to me and then these could find people walk into that graveyard and pick me up.

02:20:18

And you've been a pleasure ever since ochi also drinks zio's, body onto the elevator.

02:20:29

He was body is is safe and out of the way. The crater decal somehow comes with him. So, wherever i put him, there's still a crater portable hole but it's just to make him look bad.

02:20:50

Show people that stands here with his hand on hovering over the on button, ready? He's an action to tap it. And then hop on right one? All right, everyone ready? Yeah, tap hop. Well, Peppa Peppa. Wait, let's see. Indiana Jones. One a hexagonal platform. A blue force forms on the floor of the shaft and then the tiny head forms around you.

02:21:33

So someone want to explain what points you only before going in, like as she's turning invisible light. Um, it goes up. 50 feet around pleasant music begins playing. Uh, no not pleasant music because it goes up. 50 feet around. Oh dear. So, you're flattened to the floor. Boom, boom.

02:22:05

Boom. And let me reveal, i forgot to tell you that. I took heavy gravity acclimation, so i'm fine. Well, this goes up, that's fair.

02:22:20

Off everybody go. We don't want to fall. Uh, so 50 feet up. You start seeing something over the lip of the then. I double you guys. I did.

02:22:52

You start seeing the head of something, the lot of what working out over the edge as you approach OG starts crying. Again, suddenly feeling very vindicated guys being fuck image. Okay, i was going to make a roof over us to make it look like we are the things empty.

02:23:22

Hell. Yeah. Mako.

02:23:28

Wow, my initiative is just. Wow, i'm really bad at it. That is some special that's there initiative to um the fuck yeah pretty much boom. Boom.

02:23:54

Fire. Why the fuck does it breathe fire? Just why is it have so many fucking wings? So the more as is always had pretty fire. I they, they do, but they lived environments. Yeah, she doesn't know. So knowledge, our commas. They are magical beasts.

02:24:28

So something your arcanoes would have been useful for relax. I got this 19. Well, you also have a bard, whatever, dude, it is a bard, it is a bard and, and actually a 19 is also enough to get you a question about the remoras.

02:24:59

Special attacks. Um, yeah yeah. So so we're just gonna, it has a special attack called heat. Uh, and enraged to memorial's generates heat. So intense that anything touching its body. Takes 8b6 points of fire damage, creatures striking a memorials with natural attacks or unarmed strikes are subject to this damage.

02:25:24

But creatures striking with melee weapons are not the heat can melt or burn weapons. Any weapons that strikes, a remoras allowed. A DC 1942, save to avoid taking damage. They do also have a breath weapon, a cone of fire and swallow hole. Oh dear, we should not rocks. Busy.

02:25:51

Uh, all of you are small efforts to follow hole. Oh you or it is huge.

02:26:01

Uh, i'm not going to tell you that. I get two questions then it is. I'm just gonna give you the rest of it because there's not much more after that is immune to both fire and cold.

02:26:17

Uh oh it does have Trevor sense actually. Yes, i forgot their tremor since. Why do i even bother? I'm so sorry. I was so weirded out by everything here. No way you got another one of those fly potions.

02:26:42

Because this thing can see you as long as you're touching the ground. Are you fucking kidding me? We just had the fox say, Boom. So um i can't call any of that stuff out. Until it's my turn, right? Grow fedex.

02:27:11

And everyone get your reflex saves ready. Uh, it doesn't actually have a breath weapon or if it does. It didn't propagate one.

02:27:28

Is this one of those things were like it's just the internals or super hot think. So i'm double checking right now like how like hemzo demons i think it's done kind of like swallow you home it just as damage but they can't speak acid. Yes it does. Why did they drive freezing fire?

02:27:48

Then i am i mean it should radiate fire. It shouldn't be breathing out of his mouth. It's very deceptive. Yeah, no. No breathing fire. But if it follows you, it does a lot of fire damage uh amigo has no more flights.

02:28:30

A mango is done playing around chopped up uh but minus four damage because it's immune fire that is still 27 points of fucking damage. So she just spins off of this platform and cuts of fucking third of its back off. I told her that one, he did actually, uh, but now it's the remorse's turn.

02:29:05

To our weapons. Not take damage and the sui doesn't take fire damage now, tennis, so he's so fucking cool. I forgot. It does fire damage artifact in unity. Something something cheater. It's true magic? Items saving throw bonus is 2 plus half its caster level rounded down. I'm about to melt my swords.

02:29:37

What is the was the and normally on its turn though is giving her protection from energy fire.

02:30:02

That is sorry, differently. The blasphemy of a d 20pfsrd, like,

02:30:14

And and of course, it's gotta grab. Wow. Uh, so it bites amiko and tries to swallow her, but a meco has tenosoi between it. And it's about. That's so sick. I wish. Oh, she was as cool as fucking makeup away. It's okay. We'll find like the fucking murmosa at some point.

02:30:43

Yeah, problem that is actually on the on the docket. You know, they don't they don't call it the muramasa but it's the muramasa i'm doing my best to tune in this out right now.

02:31:04

Was a crafter. The mass on the name was the legendary sword. Yes, which one is pepper off the sword?

02:31:17

Fuck off, giant nogginata bullshit, but yeah, but i think it would be really funny about you tried to use a sword that big. I thought that wasn't she the extra long noches. Yes. Anagunada is essentially a katana on the end of a long. Yeah. But the way that he has to fight with it, basically makes it functionally like more than knocking off.

02:31:39

Yeah, because it's more like a sphere that you just holding a really small. Yeah, it does try to buy the thing that did not get past. It seemed these. Oh wait acrobatics 27 acrobatic, check it. That's you're fine. Uh, i don't believe i'm talking but i will i can totally draw a line through It is, it is very clearly through it.

02:32:18

It's here. I am very stupid right now. He's ignore me. I am, i am an intelligent person. That is currently very stupid. Um, please please take your angry ninja smash. Oh, it's also very important that i rule this d4. Okay. You have four rounds before the platform finishes Boom.

02:32:48

That was an attempt to stop. Uh, that was a hit. And what's the hospital thing? Two. Plus it's cat and trouble round down. What for weapon? Melting damage, right? Oh yes, hold on. Let me also take all for natural armor for your weapons fortitude. Save, i believe you're correct yet.

02:33:24

What's the that's the level of plus one like five or something? Minimum i think of plus one is three but you're exactly plus two. So, would be six the depending lockersachi. Oh yeah, right? It's not, you're, you're smart. You're you're smart anyway. I think it's wondering what. No, defending is one.

02:33:59

Okay. Okay. So two plus half of its level which we've determined is six. So it'll be three. So this would be five a defending weapon is minimum casserole? Yeah. Okay, so

02:34:18

Six, i believe that the requirement because of the requirements of the spells. Okay.

02:34:31

With the four, four, uh, half of gasoline.

02:34:41

What are we doing? The saving throw for the magic weapon against the remaaz's. Heat ability to destroy the shit out of her weapon. But why did you roll a d4? I'm not a d20 1d20. Plus 2 plus 4 is what i said year old before to determine the the flooring thing because you had.

02:35:02

Oh, yeah. Okay, yes, please roll your saved. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Which number are you using as a casser level? Because what i'm seeing is the requirement to create a magic weapon is three times. The highest caster level of like whatever is making it. So it's essentially three times whenever the bonus is yes, which i said, six.

02:35:24

And then i looked up defending and that said, minimum eight. Okay, i'm trying to understand because i'm still very new to this stuff because it's the plus one weapon plus defending is another plus one bonus. So that's a plus components. It doesn't matter. I roll the one. It doesn't matter what the bonus is on this weapon at this point.

02:35:41

Oh, well, i'm trying to learn because all of us use weapons. So i know. I know. I'm just, that is very true. I did not set up its heat damage. Crap, i could roll really low. Actually think you're watching might be okay.

02:36:09

So good news is i know hardness comes into conjunction because it's an object. So the steps have some flow. Uh, i don't know the harnesses but i will check this out and solve this in the entrance. I kind of yeah i think i think your weapon will survive our whole survived.

02:36:28

The question is, is how many more attacks? Is it going to take night? Pretty fair ochi. Oh gee, it begins crying again as a free action. Never know, she hasn't hit any of us and he's gonna call out. Uh, i've read about this. It will destroy your weapons unless they're very, very strong.

02:36:50

Be careful. Also, i forget if it breathes, fire on us or not be aware, that's a possibility. Maybe and then he's really gonna actually start crying. Um,

02:37:10

Oh god. How do you do corners in this again? No, we'll just once it's reach. Let's start over. Let's just relax, 15 feet. Okay, it's a lot. It's a huge creature. Luckily for you, i'm gonna roll acrobatics and move there. How's that? Okay.

02:37:40

Why. What can i change my answer to their? I'm stupid. I need to be close enough to hit him. Yes, that's fine.

02:37:55

I'm having a really rough day today. I'm gonna, no, i'm not. I'm just gonna attack it thinking and sneak attack need to happen. Didn't take any power. Yay! Let's do magic weapons for the win. That was mundane weapon. It would have melt flag. Oh, i would have been gone.

02:38:25

Game. Very nice. So 1D 20 plus 4 plus 2.

02:38:37

Uh, yes, actually you have the exact same stats.

02:38:46

Is it roll? Is that what you have to do? Yeah, exceptional. And you're using it's actually the same weapon. Yeah, it how did we pick up two defending walkers?

02:39:14

How does that work? And me go to its heat abilities, where did you save 19 to avoid taking damage? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, even less damage. It doesn't take your legacy is also fine. Okay cool. They are they're dangerously glowing but not not quite reason.

02:39:50

And grace, he kills it.

02:39:55

No, perhaps not with technicals for most of those. Yeah, that's unfortunate. Luckily, all you need is the 16 to hit it. Nina. Where are you? Oh, it's amazing to be used to them. Okay, i can't hear you. Go get him, right. Go tell her that's usual. It's because one of those buffs that just don't seem to go away the icons, all right?

02:40:20

You just need the items. I'm gonna do we still have good hope because i still have it on good hopeless for a minute and that is the end of that.

02:40:38

Uh, everyone gets off the platform.

02:40:49

That wasn't quite enough murder to save me.

02:41:02

Because literally like nine. Second later the entire platform just fucking vanishes leaving a gaping hole falling 100 feet, back down to the surface.

02:41:19

There is another control panel right here and some doors.

02:41:28

Oh, she puts his foot on your back. No way and pushes you towards the door. Is this chamber is called the winter worm. This chamber is significantly warmer than the other rooms in the fire. The tower is central. Hexagonal shaft is open uh to this chamber on three sides but it's other three sides.

02:41:46

Continue up towards the blue sphere above because northeast and northwest two, hexagonal portals standing in the walls filled with featureless opaque crystal.

02:41:59

I don't like this place. Um shoko backs up and puts an arm over like like a a hold on letter cook arm across omei with him because you work there last time she opened the door. You don't want to be over there, okay? Thanks for the vote of fucking confidence, furball

02:42:34

All right, so how does the store explain?

02:42:41

I everyone or this is a really fun session. So far exploited to you. I've been, do you have a good day being? That's right. I know you did you ever hear with me? So as your examining the doors, you find no visible blocking magnetism. Okay. And pushing crystal the doors are made.

02:43:08

From is i stinky boy. Not something you recognize, but there is another crystal and control panel adjacents to each store that can be used to open the door with a disable device. Check.

02:43:27

And then you've seen stuff like this before. What was it? Like four, i don't think i've ever seen anything like this. The goal marks has a tendency to make some very interesting exhibits for, particularly shall we? Call them eccentric. Customers. I think people don't actually look at those plans before buying them, but, uh, some people look at someone, they're not buying them.

02:43:54

I see.

02:44:01

Disable themselves, i think.

02:44:07

Until the roll. It's in between the two lines. Oh haha. No way with a 38. Uh this is easily the most difficult Azul you've ever had to crack. I would dare say it actually takes you a unusual amount of time to open it. And when you finally input the right sequence, uh, the hexagonal portals.

02:44:42

Retract into the walls in six, equal triangular sections.

02:44:49

It will during array of crystals.

02:45:01

If we're willing array of crystals and metallic tracery, are embedded in the walls of this chamber, a low humming noise, fills the air and the crystals flash with incomprehensively colored lights. It irregular intervals. Scattered about the room are six. What appear to be crystalline scorpion, like creatures? I guess i'm just saying back here.

02:45:27

I didn't realize it was going to be initiative initiative. They just wondering about the room. Oh oh. Okay, before we get too much further into this, i want to double check. No way on something. Abbby's, usually 100%, right. But i'm seeing for each plus one of a magic weapons enhancement bonus adds plus two to its hardness and tend to its hit points.

02:45:52

And hardness is essentially dr. For objects, right? Damage has to go over the threshold, so the hardness of a light blade is 10. So we have, like, 14, hardness, 14, hardness, 22, hp. And because it's an object energy damage gets hit oh fire damage gets half. Okay them that's where you lost.

02:46:14

Me and fire is energy, right? Okay. I just wanted to make sure that i understood because i was like, we both have one sword. Now, you know. Wonderful. Um, more accept after talking compositions of what was that? She's huh knowledge. The planes. Uh funny cryptoide doors. I can deal with uh not so much moving sculptures.

02:46:47

Okay, that is just enough to recognize crismals show code that is just enough to recognize what a Chrismal is christmas. There's the originate in the deepest caverns of the plane of earth on rare occasions. These strange creatures wind up on the material plane. Usually in subterranean areas. Rich looking bodies with natural gem and crystal.

02:47:09

Formations. They're made of money. They are made of crystals. They also enjoy feasting, uh, on crystals, especially iron stones.

02:47:28

So, it's just go gets a worried look on his face and his eyes dark to the eye and got one on his hand.

02:47:40

Airline stone in it. Yeah. There is what kind of limestone oh, that's tasty one. It gave her they gave endure elements. Oh, um, excuse me, uh, almost in unison, all of the chrismals turn and look at shoko and all of their pincers, kind of like wiggle a little bit.

02:48:09

Yeah. Because they've been trapped in here. Forbidden by their contract from eating the crystals and stones embedded in the magitech search tree. Uh, my my mine mine that is what i'm feeling and i'm like, oh, i don't know what you did. She'll go, but i don't like that. Yoko does exactly what he did and sochi will know on this big.

02:48:39

They're not getting it from me. Oh, she will know to throw the glove in. I'm

02:48:51

Yeah, just close the door. They'll just eat right through the door, i'm sure.

02:49:00

I would have assumed that they would have sugar. You shouldn't have said anything. You should have been like, well no need to go over there at the close the door. I was actually going to ask Charlie if anyone had an iron stone by. The only one with an ions down on me.

02:49:17

I don't know. I might be.

02:49:22

I also have an iron torch like, in my pocket and they don't care about those. That's, that's not a real ion stone. That's a dead iron stone that someone cats can one.

02:49:42

What's the action to pop out an iron stone call? It a move action since you got it. Nice gauntlet. You're on your bed, right? Go, go lay down.

02:49:59

Exactly the makeover. It's so fast. Princess since i stopped throwing yourselves. And what am i saying? Certainly will not stop throwing myself into dangers. Long as my friends are. Are when you do this? Oh well to be honestly, probably ate the pizza and a donut. Yeah, no way. Uh now he's just looking exasperated like i just got the damn thing.

02:50:30

Okay. And is i guess seven things started like three hit something there. There are several options here. You could fight the crismals or just let's show go what. Throw this ion sound to them. Is that what you're doing? I don't know. I think i'm gonna try and do that.

02:50:48

Yeah. Go and ochi volk know that they will, then just go after the iron stone. They have very little interest in organic beings.

02:51:03

Show. Go throws. Throw the glove in. Did we just jump over? Grayson. No, he passed his turn. Okay, i just now realized there's an intern button. How many sessions in are we?

02:51:24

I'm sorry. Uh, yeah, he says shooko, throw the glove in and he's gonna draw his swords. In case shoka wants to risk all of our lives for his glove. And i will tell him i'll buy him a new one but later.

02:51:39

Oh,

02:51:43

That's not good.

02:51:57

Stop.

02:54:55

Commitment. Do you see them all sort of form, a circle around the stone and starts sucking the power out of it. Oh, i heard that there was sharing it's there. Intelligent sort of, they haven't fixed. That's pretty fucking smart. Well, maybe they'll be destructed enough for me to come in here and take a look around.

02:55:28

See if there's anything worthwhile in here or perhaps is anything we can sabotage in here. There certainly won't be any gems. No idea. What anything does wanna break it? Well, well, i mean me and Noah might be able to put our minds together and like figure out what something here does.

02:55:53

Well, give me a spellcraft check because i'm assuming you're gonna look through the room with tech magic.

02:56:07

Oh dear. I did not put them any ranks and spell. Correct. Oh dear. No no. You did not.

02:56:21

This is why we have like,

02:56:27

An arcanist or this kind of shit but he's currently yamchid. So,

02:56:44

Um yeah, a bunch of faint magic. Going through all of the magic circuitry there are two things of individual power. That are their own things that are like, here's sherry programs hard to explain to your character. Uh you don't know what they are but there's a six inch by six inch by six inch cube uh of blue steel with circuitry all over it.

02:57:21

And what looks like a snowflake on one side. Uh and there's also a long rough prism sitting on one of the tables that is glowing decently powerful.

02:57:43

Uh, no way. Can you make hide or hair of the stuff? And i gesture to the two objects.

02:57:55

Probably not says, Abby the player not the character, huh? Um, i don't know. I don't know. I assume it'll be they'll be magical things in that they are magical things. They require like a an actual spell graph and i am not your major oh whatever they are. They they seem important uh so i guess i'll take them with me.

02:58:22

Will pick up the two objects. All right and now we resume combat rounds. Oh as all of them spin and his at you i was i put them back. I put them back. I put them back. Nope them. You did which now means they get to do things like this.

02:58:45

Oh boy. He asked me if i ever get tired of being wrong and doing the exactly worse thing in every situation. No. The the chrismal weeps, its tail at you and a shard flies out and embeds in the wall next to your head.

02:59:14

Send anyone speak primordial? Are we still okay ignan, are we still in uh or was it good? Karen. Good hope or no good. Hope. All right. Battle popping image or role department image?

02:59:39

Kind of two images. So, as an image,

03:00:21

Depicts. Come on.

03:00:30

Moving right along. I thought i was being smart. I thought i could like throw the guard dog a stake and then just grab the thing and leave. You would have until you touched literally anything in the room. Well, that's what i mean. It is their contracted job by their by their binders to protect those room and everything in it.

03:00:58

So that pops the other image because it's been five. So yeah there's just a rain of crystalline spikes that go flying at you.

03:01:12

And this is why rushing everywhere.

03:01:22

That my bad, my bad.

03:01:30

I don't think i have a way to fight these.

03:01:41

Um, oh yeah. They have drift by bludgeoning, by the way. Why? Why. Before i forget if they're made of crystal. Wow, if they're contracted to hit to fight, whoever's it trying to take stuff in here. Then maybe they'll just focus on me.

03:02:10

Tell your mom, where's your mom?

03:02:19

And i'm out with. I don't fucking cares. I'm gonna have to do do some good old. Uh, let me move my character. Damn it. I mean, fine, I'll use one allergies.

03:02:40

You want an acrobatics?

03:02:48

I would like to not get stabbed.

03:02:54

Okay. Myself. You are just fine with that roll. I can only imagine that. No i just kind of like gets there and just stands. Don't just excuse me. It comes through. Sorry, stands there. And it's like, look how am i supposed to hit these things? I'm not, i'm not swinging the sword and they're just tries to kick you.

03:03:17

They only understand terren on that. I don't speak fancy pants. Oak tree, our polygon. You pick up taron right? No. No, i did not. I imagine the science would be my answer even if he was on. What did you not hear me?

03:03:58

Absolutely did not do that. Why would they do that? That's some stupid.

03:04:07

Deep basically made it so that like they're all four languages are just primordial. Yeah. There's a there's a similar aspect to it in so far that the elemental languages are um aesthetically similar in script. But uh like because it's the equivalent of saying, all of these languages are written in the romantic script.

03:04:34

So they're all in life but english is not spanish, spanish is not freaking etc.

03:04:50

Uh, for the record gracing is using his bludgeoning arrows.

03:05:13

Back one. One arrow hits two heroes. Arrow. Shatter, where do you want the third area to go?

03:05:28

That is definitely not the right color. They just sort of fold it, crystal and bits.

03:05:39

This one.

03:05:45

About boom. Well done, sir. Anything else for you? Oh g. Uh,

03:06:05

Oh, geez. Gonna sheve is swords back into their case to turn it back into a quarter staff. And then step up to these Chris scorpions, and that's going to be his turn. You should be able to flip them around and wack them with the back of the blade like bottle size style.

03:06:30

Yeah, that's true. That requires a feat, big ball. Oh, i didn't realize that i'd actually be a thing. Yeah, i think it's like one of the weapon tricks or like unity. Things are crystal spanking away.

03:06:51

It gets punished. But yeah, that battle hit, they're not smart, they're not super smart.

03:07:03

Their orders to protect these magitech devices are fairly suicidal and then uh, yeah, like it's entire fucking stinger goes through a shoulder. Like oh oh i don't like that. They're big crystal shards too. I i do not enjoy that.

03:07:39

Other crystal ball.

03:07:48

This one, it's already taking damage.

03:07:56

But it's still gonna fire his spike at the thief and this. Yeah, she'll go. Uh,

03:08:21

More attacks are not as important as landing heart attacks here. So i will go with inspired.

03:08:46

And as move action, i'll pick up the other object just to really get to them. Well, no, i was a standard. Oh wait, no, i have i have arctic action as um, as a uh, it's fire encourage as a movement action now, so i can then do something with my standard action actually, uh,

03:09:14

Wave ladies, unfortunately, piercing and slashing. Um soco will attempt to continue to uh maintain agro by turning around and driving his dagger into a random patch of machinery.

03:09:36

Yoko has just pulled all aggro.

03:09:42

Anything else on your turn? No, that'll be it. Okay, that christmas mall is dead.

03:09:54

Baby.

03:10:17

Nothing really of help.

03:10:32

No, she's just going to cast here. Serious wounds and fly out of their reach because they are small.

03:10:54

And she goes over and pets. You on the shoulder? Where the crystal shards. Here's to you and it falls out. Um, and then again, you're very welcome.

03:11:09

Um, he already threw his one of the day shard.

03:11:18

Actually get to you through his friends. So he is going to attack the nearest person in rage. With a stinger, nope.

03:11:41

Also can't get you so nearest person in a rage with a sticker.

03:11:50

Yel.

03:11:57

This is when you told me it has crystal poisoning, i'm boom. Do i tell you that? Because i don't see anything about that anywhere. I i don't actually know. I i know blissfully little about crystals honestly. Yeah. No, they just have crystal sense and shirt spike. What the fuck is?

03:12:16

Kristen said, they can sense the presence of any crystals or gym. So than 30 feet as using this, they smell crystals. Got it big you. They smelled the bling. This one's turn has not thrown a spike and shoko. Koya, ochi and amigo get attacks of opportunity.

03:12:44

Uh, i mean yeah sure.

03:12:50

Because you suppose, you could take an attack opportunity. And so eight. Damage seven point damage.

03:13:08

Two points of damage.

03:13:31

Here we go. Six points. Damage, that was the last thing that Chris mobile will ever do.

03:13:49

Heart attack.

03:13:54

Uh, so minus 5.

03:14:02

No way.

03:14:08

You don't want to just slide footstep? Oh yeah, you'll fight footstep for you. Dang your princess.

03:14:19

Let me punch this thing with sneak attack.

03:14:35

Punch.

03:14:38

Um, shatters.

03:14:45

It's like into several pieces. Excellent. And then i'm going to edibatics over here. Oh yes, wherever you want. They cannot stop you.

03:15:08

Oh, gracing.

03:15:20

Exterminate.

03:15:27

Home. Super 31. It's so 27 hits and i believe finishes it off. There's only one left and think that third arrow. Hits it? Yes. But this one is that boy tree. It's still standing with one left. Oh, gee beat issue like a cheesecake, man. She's kick. They can't move anywhere.

03:16:07

It says i'm sorry. I had the measure tool on that was me earlier. Don't worry about it, i can't move anywhere. He says, with his measured tape out scroll down the floor.

03:16:29

Actually, it's still not letting me move. Anywhere. Can you move me anywhere? Adjacent to him. The milk. Figure this out later in a location of. Adjacency please. So right here, that works great. Thank you. You're welcome.

03:16:52

You guys ready for this? Whiff.

03:17:03

Uh, that is the missed by two. Unfortunately, that is that's fine. You have inspire courage. If you don't have inspire courage on, you should put that on.

03:17:22

Kids on now. How much more was i give you? I have no idea a plus two.

03:17:34

That might have been what i cut out on my laptop on showcas turned, and that hits and ends the remaining charisma.

03:17:53

This door is locked. I just tried it.

03:18:16

She'll go walks over sadly to his depleted. Itemstone, and he wasted if the crystals are defeated. Five thousand gold pieces worth of valuable crystals and gemstones can be pride from the walls. One of these crystals is a crystalline cube of frost resistance and another is a gem of brightness.

03:18:38

Never mind.

03:18:50

Hell yeah, good works baby. This door's locked. What happens when i try to turn the handle from the inside? It unlocks and opens. Oh, red. Just like the other one.

03:19:12

You guys ready to dial the next floor? You think if we trash this room? We might like stop the store and outside or something. Considering we are not a tough. Oh man. I like your thinking of yeah we probably just turn the elevator off, probably.

03:19:40

Let's go see what there is to see.

03:19:48

All right. This control panel seemed more complex than the one below.

03:20:02

All right, so what do you want? Are you going to be from me or a, uh, disabled device from know what? I can have two from one of you or one. From each of you. Either way, i need a caution of two in any form and you only get one chance at each roll.

03:20:22

So decide to carefully.

03:20:27

Uh,

03:20:31

Plus 22. But i can. I do have, where is that? Uh,

03:20:43

I do have inspire competence.

03:20:51

For sure. Do do we lose good? Hope yet? It's been several minutes. Crystalline something. Yeah, a cute. Oh yeah, cube all crust resistance. The the inspire are good, would the good? Help would give would last would have lasted for seven minutes as i've been seven minutes since the bike downstairs.

03:21:24

Uh, no not yet. You guys haven't really stopped to rest for very long. All right then uh inspire competence would give your check, no way a plus three. Would that be enough to boost it over? What i can do? I can already do that. Other name. Okay, then get a get an inspired competence.

03:21:49

Plus three plus three say. All right? Yeah, those taco glasses comes around. Takes a look.

03:22:05

Let's see if we can get you to cooperate. You're going to be quietly taps out a beats on the drum next to your ear. That makes you better at reading the computer a little bit close for comfort, but i appreciate it. Um, you need two checks. I heard, yep.

03:22:33

Okay, no way. So partway through activating this elevator, you realize that someone has rigged a trap in it and you rapidly unravel the the second code that was designed to prevent the protective barrier from forning. Forming over the elevator this time, which would have left you completely exposed to the storm's winds and lightning during your scent.

03:23:09

So you see her working at the panel and then after a couple of of seconds, blinks picture glasses off again, looks at it cleans them off, put some back on and it goes, excuse me a second and then just like got sin to the bottom of this panel rips up and is like someone's put something in here, pulls a wire.

03:23:36

There you go. Thanks Rocco. Anytime.

03:23:56

But it's still tapping as we go. Okay, so what are these two items we picked up? Because one of them said you said cube of what prosper system, trust resistance? Yes. Oh right now shooko has that? Let me see what it does.

03:24:20

A storms shouldn't be blocking your vision like that.

03:24:43

Oh that's an expensive one brush 27 grand. Holy crap. Uh, a big circle will press this on our way up.

03:25:03

We are up.

03:25:07

Show goes like looking at this cube. As this horrifying lightning storm, death trap is surrounding us.

03:25:21

A 20 foot wide. Hexagonal hole lies in the huge. It's a gunnel chain forest stone platforms jet from the walls. 50 feet above the floor above these platforms, a pair of open windows in each wall. Look out out over the icy. Landscape outside. Six, large crystals are embedded in the walls between the windows glowing with a blue radiance.

03:25:50

I above a wide hexagonal opening pierces, the ceiling beyond this opening. A massive sphere of blue light, sheds, a dazzling, radiance bolts of crackling electricity, join with the crystals and the walls with the bowl of energy. A howling. Gale sweeps downward from the sphere carrying a rumble of distant thunder.

03:26:17

So quickly over the layout again, these those are the four platforms. 50 feet up. No. So, yes, that, yes, those platforms are 50 feet up. These walls go even higher. These are the windows. You will note the blue crystals that are described here here. Yes, it just made it sound like the windows were like centered on the platform.

03:26:48

I was like is there additional windows? Because they see the functional ones on. No, it's just these ones that are between. Yeah, okay, i guess the way that it was worded. Confuse me a little bit. I just want to make sure i understand so there's not like an additional elevation above this.

03:27:04

There is there's a ceiling above here where the blue sphere is sitting in a hexagon, a hole. There's a little bit of a ceiling where this sphere of lightning and all of that is about gotcha. Like that's not actually surrounding you, it's a bogey, but it was meant to scare the fuck out of you.

03:27:24

So how high is the ceiling? Uh almost a hundred feet up. Wow. Okay. And then these are like kind of arrow. Slit type. Window deals. Are they how that might be too specifically a question? How, how big are the windows like, vertically? Do you think? Uh, i don't think they run way up.

03:27:44

They do they run all the way up. Interesting.

03:27:52

Or some platforms just above the walls. 50 feet above the floor above these, a pair of open windows each look out on the asking landscape. Oh, i missed the pair, that makes more sense. Now, i see, uh, there's a pair of windows farther up and six large crystals are embedded in the walls between the windows beyond.

03:28:20

There's a lot of windows, the open the top level. This power is very open to the storm outside. Okay? This while being the third elevatory window is the, there's another floor at the top. This is the final floor. Okay. Sorry for all my questions. Here quite weird, right? Where did the cool wings lady?

03:28:46

Go.

03:28:51

Get here. No, no. I can't.

03:29:01

Are these are these four frost wipes on the ground with us? They are do the thing. And sorry, one second, let me

03:29:19

Overhead levels. Let me put it at. 90 to 99. Can you see her now? Yes, i can. Okay, so the storm cloud was actually below her instead of above her.

03:29:47

Did you do so four horse for our spirits control, the floor of this chamber under the protection of an unhollow spell immediately attacking any intruder. As tatiana stands atop, the northern platform. The storm sphere bind, the bounce binds her to the moroseco's flashing with power.

03:30:26

It's been quite right? Battle music.

03:30:53

Nope, on anything.

03:30:58

Everyone can start joining me in initiative. Uh the pharmacy is failed as long as he was never an option. Is this a battle where we have time to fight today? Or is the next week thing? We should probably give this next week. It is almost six because she is the final boss fight for this area.

03:31:22

So she's villainously monologue at us at all because i am like still baffled as to why exactly. Where even here, uh, i know trying to do

03:31:36

Evil gods tells her to do evil things. More at 11, more at 11.

03:31:49

Why did you do at cocktail? Why did you piss off the dragon and plunge the north into this? Horrible storm. Lol, she replies.

03:32:03

I think, i think more accurately. It's probably you kathia leaves that methadone scene. Yeah, i don't and continues attempting to uh, i'm going to guess blastos given the amount of electricity currently and obviously. Yeah. Can you guess what? She's gonna be? Casting. I have a guess. I don't like any of it.

03:32:29

Is it some very end of charm person? Wait, no suggestion. He has half merged herself with a very real storm. Oh no. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

03:32:57

Be fun. They will pick appropriate music. This one. This one deserves special music. So this is the boss book 3. No, this is the mid boss of book 3.

03:33:19

I thought the other guy was the mid-bossible, right? He was the one of the mid bosses. He was the pre-med boss. He was he was the warm-up.

03:33:31

I'm sorry. I have i have a question. I will forget this by next week but it's important at least the whole frost ones that can just see. Unfortunately. Yes. Okay. I'm muttering her. The rest of you. I don't care. You, you can have one, please. Let me just continuously, stab something.

03:33:50

Don't you get at least a little bit of information to save my curiosity. Can i make a knowledge role on what she is? This is a paizen that was local and knowledge. The planes. You're not allowed to continuously. Stab anything. You get one stab that local that local is going to beat the hell out of my planes.

03:34:16

Yo, um, i know it's okay, though. You can tell that she is a half fiendochi. Oh, that actually does make sense for me to know a little bit. She is a half demon uh shoko. You know that she is a half, beamed self. What is this? Fucking protagonist enemy.

03:34:40

We have here a half being self.

03:34:48

How's that everybody? I wish to be lightning child upon my throne of lightning, please give me more lightning powers odeity of mine in the frost land so that i may bring more lightning. Yes, that is fairly accurate. Um,

03:35:08

Real real quick harmonica obedience. She has demonic obedience, of course.

03:35:19

This is great enough to have

03:35:26

He is a level 9 clear to fit, so she may have the feet but not the abilities. Cool work. Lyric a female. You can tell she's the cleric by the holy symbol of sifted that she's wielding. And yes. Yes. They gave her flyby attack. Okay. Okay, that's actually fine.

03:36:01

I don't, i don't like that. He's also a fully buff lyric.

03:36:13

Replies. Grayson do a murder and has gale aura. Never mind.

03:36:29

I mean we're pretty much fully buffed too. It's just it's like they knew someone was gonna play an archer in this. AP and put a bunch of enemies that were like, air orcles and air, clerics and ice witches, and ninja to just catch the arrows. This is actually the same height, where we've been like, okay.

03:36:56

The big bad is up on a platform of on top of, like, way up these walls, use her with kimon. Thoughts of this woman is way more dangerous, kim, and don't. You have fiend for a reason. Okay. Yeah. The CR i know is going to be way higher. But like with that with the flying oracle and now with her it tells me that they've really wanted like to and the dragon even like they're really trying to send a message to the players of.

03:37:29

You should all have a way to climb or fly or do something do range attacks because many only have natural fly speeds. Yeah, all i'm hearing is, how do i acquire acquire a supernatural flies bead? That's done at this point. That's fair. I mean yeah i think they also want the ninjas to feel like ninjas so they can naruto run up the walls to the bad guy.

03:37:56

Yeah. But we actually legitimately cannot do that. Yeah, like, monks can do cool stuff like that, if they spend a hell of feet, but or take a, whatever a monk train, isn't it? Just involves ninja stuff. None of which like i've had like two opportunities to really do the ninja stuff, beyond being rogue and that's about it.

03:38:23

Yep, i'm gonna have to literally i'm gonna have this seriously. Consider just taking tengo wings because like everything is flying all the time. I mean that's just pathfinder first of it. That's what basically level seven. The game is like, hey so um you've got full casters, right?

03:38:54

Yeah, that's all we need our address. For feel like we haven't fought this many flying or high up enemies even in freaking wrath where we are fighting demons. Oh, we haven't. We really haven't like it's a theme in jade region. It's an obvious theme like they want you to have the wuja battle?

03:39:20

Well, there's some there is a huge element of anime going on here and they're not deny it here. I was trying to not weep and not like few weed, okay? So before we move on, we'll have to find a tree and mark two lines and then me and noche will run up them until yeah until we can do it.

03:39:51

Yeah, and no way just like just jumps straight 50 feet in the air and so disgrace. And i mean, i could just pick up like a slippers of spider climb somewhere or something. Oh, that probably isn't gonna be enough eventually. I mean it's already. I don't know about you you've.

03:40:14

You've got like other options, Duke's first podcast. Like it's always kind of a chore to be about. It's so reliant on like and i have a couple of you here grace and you know, how to create a text with automated animations, right? Because you did that with your flurry of blows um i never assigned to animations to them at all.

03:40:45

No, interesting. All right. Well, then this will be a quick lesson for everyone on your combat or inventory tab on your character sheet. You can go to almost anything on your page because i gave everyone trusted player and select edit item. And if that has an ability, take for example, i'll use 10.

03:41:19

No sui. Well, i don't know about anybody else. I can't see anything on this map. Yeah, we have no vision here. So even if we do figure this out, we won't be able to see, oh, this is just the start page. You can just drop characters on it.

03:41:39

Oh, i remember this. Remember these days. Remember this reason. So if you hit edit items at the top of the window to opens, there's a little radioactive symbol next to an a dash. A. I see it. Click on that. This will open the automated anime animations menu. Several things will auto track to my master list of already created animations.

03:42:11

That's what i was for anything, but for anything that doesn't, you can come in here on your character sheet and click customize item. And then right next to that, we'll be animation type. You've got if you open that you have melee ranged on token. That's going to be mostly auras and such, uh, templates, orbs.

03:42:35

Actual oras and presets. Uh, which shows a bit more stuff.

03:42:47

So when you're doing this edit i don't think does that also work with like abilities and buffs where you can do the same sort of thing. Yes, actually you can. All right, this is gonna be like you have a buff that you want to give like an effect to.

03:43:03

Yeah, say your resolve. If you want to add like let's just go yeah do something cool for that or like when noe goes invisible. She has like a little, you know, proof cloud. Yeah, she can set that up for her vanish. Abby knows how to do all this. Yeah, i have bothered with a lot of it just because i mean i haven't i have followed.

03:43:32

Let's go to your install. Click AA, like customize item. So since resolve only affects you, you would select on token for the animation type and then you can open on the primary animation. It starts with spells but there's lots of things. So there's chains conditions creature attacks energy, fire, generic ice leaves, lightning, all sorts of things.

03:44:03

So yeah, this is for resolved. We're just gonna take a quick look at conditions. Uh it's for resolved. So we're going to take a look at shield, there's several variances here. So, right at the top of the ability, there's a little preview button. You can click this will pop up a little video that plays what you currently have in your animation.

03:44:39

You lost me a little bit back. I get with this. This menu is for it. I will be happy to play with it. You said, condition was that like animation type? Yes, on the primary animation, the title. You went to auto token, that's right. Okay, and then you said on condition conditions, cool, some various types of shield effects, you can use or particles lots of things or just the basic token border.

03:45:17

Let's say we do that.

03:45:28

And i usually seems really cool. So i said something into place. Uh, you can feel free to change this obviously. So now, when OT uses his resolve,

03:45:50

You got a little burning ring of fire or inner strength of fire? Yeah, that's a cool one. What was that one? It's just on there now. You don't have to change it if you like that one, i was in there, i was playing with him. I was looking at some of these which one was that?

03:46:08

The and so let's just open up to the so it's in the token border type uh, aesthetic animation or you can do spinning. Yeah. Okay, i'm looking at it. I'm gonna actually think spinning is cooler.

03:46:41

It's, these are so rad.

03:46:50

And this is available across all my games. Now, that's so sick but you can do individual graphics for each of your character.

03:47:03

I figured if i was gonna have all these tools available, i might as well give people the ability to customize their abilities and weapon attacks.

03:47:20

Yes, i think it was a lot.

03:47:28

Yep, that was awesome.

03:47:53

There's the resolve right there.

03:47:59

The way that like it's it's been set up, someone's managed to set it up on on pf second edition. So that when you activate error, um, your overdrive on inventors like for inspiration, you have this electrified ring. It's super fucking. Yep, we can set those up too. So we'll last for the duration, i have that mod installed.

03:48:25

Oh excellent. Uh i don't know if i can actually no. No, i can think of one thing that i need. I need. How, how did you just immediately go and put a blood, splatter on your knife attack and, and, and of his animation because it's like, you you hold it like that.

03:48:57

The blood spider is a little much, so i think i'll take it.

03:49:04

It is so i've been meaning the update quiz. Anyways, melee ranged one and go make it. All right, we're gonna head out. See you guys next week. I take it easy. I wish i could make this window. Like, bigger the preview window. I'm much too blind for this tiny one.

03:49:37

Uh, so you see that little double tailed arrow down at the corner? Oh, it doesn't work on it actually. Yeah. If i full screen, i can't, i wish i could like split my foundry window.

03:50:24

And,

03:50:30

Um,

03:50:34

I know there's so many great things.

03:50:39

Now that works would do. What will it do or do this?

03:50:58

But it'll only do one attack for full attack.

03:51:10

Custom range. But then still don't have star knives. Is there a sound library for these? Because i know they can do sounds too. I was playing with that, like yeah, you have a full. I have some sounds, you're welcome to look through what i have. Are they in like user data core data?

03:51:37

Uh, they should be in the core and bizarre. So under court, it's just sounds and combat.

03:51:51

But it doesn't look like it's sword swings and stuff like that. Yeah.

03:52:04

I can certainly look into getting more though. I mean just i was just wondering what you had. I was like, oh, play with some more changing sounds. You know, i think i looked at downloading some, when i we first were using foundry. I was like, oh, this is really cool stuff.

03:52:21

I bet there's all kinds of things you can do.

03:52:29

Um, i don't have to play with this later though. My girlfriend has been alone with my son for a long time and he's angry. So, thank you guys. This was super fun. This is i think i left the hardest. I've laughed in a very long time at some of the effort to this particular session.

03:52:45

I'm glad i think. Thanks guys, i will see you next week. Everybody {question-mark} have a good one. I'm out of here.
