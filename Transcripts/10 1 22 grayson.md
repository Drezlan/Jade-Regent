03:14:51

Yes, terrible things. Definitely a crime against all living. You know, man and humanity old bird or looks at zero again thing.

03:15:08

Read sign, what? Sorry, the crime and the entity. It's crime. Okay, you So Z what I think that you're terrible. That was terrible. That's okay.

03:15:39

Also gonna heal her friend while he's sleeping. Oh, I'm sure the old man will be And not being said, though, just to avoid that happening quite so badly again. Oh, cheer, you by any chance? Using a necklace of any kind. I don't think I have an X-lot. Oh yeah.

03:16:03

I have the armor natural armor. Oh yeah, that's probably gonna be less useful to you. Then. I mean, I'm open to it especially if I'm gonna be fighting in the front like, you know, run it by me in character because all I was gonna do is that like you remember the actually, remember your character seen it?

03:16:27

Probably when we were in the, the rhymers and like, no. I ripped something off of her collar and just smashed it and the charm. Yeah. There is three currently on her neck and she just pulls one of the leather chords off and throws it at you. Oh yeah, definitely.

03:16:44

What is it a links something charm? Yeah, it's a link sidecharm. I'll I'll put on the I'll just gift it to you in a sec for sure. Thank you. You only get to use it the once, unfortunately. Yeah, I got the tattoo and I can detect, but I feel like a lot of this is just gonna be surprised around stuff anyways, so I can detect magic for illusion if we think we're being followed somewhere, but I can't wait, you know, insta?

03:17:10

See invisibility or anything? Hmm. Well, I can do a couple other things, but the most important one really is gonna be that, that particular kind of divining. Yeah.

03:17:29

So if I might get this to you, you should hopefully not have a link sidecharm. I'm sure I do. I'll go look.

03:17:47

Like this. Fixed anyone have anything broken. That needs fixing think all my stuff. Everyone got your new classabilities and stuff. Added just fine. Yeah, no way. When you leveled up any ninja levels, did it automatically add like ninja trick for you or you going and selecting them as you level up, because it didn't give it to me.

03:18:13

And I went, and you, you have, you have to manually go in and add the trick as you. I just want to make sure I did. I didn't use any this level so far but I was like, hmm. You should be able to find most of them in the features compendium.

03:18:27

They did. I just was like, looking through almost like it didn't doesn't say ninja trick anywhere here. So I didn't know how. Yeah, you just, you know what I mean? Like for the the warrior poet, like the things you can select like every odd level like it doesn't have those automatically either so I kind of assumed it was like that.

03:18:49

Yeah. It's yeah, elective stuff. Yeah, most of the art lady aren't built up to do that and I don't think they're ever going to be. No, because I mean, you're you. Yeah. If you're getting that deep into it and doing an archetype like you should probably know and go find it yourself.

03:19:10

Yeah, I just realized you haven't pecked anyone forever? No, I didn't pack people and he won't O2 probably never will

03:19:26

He thinks that's disgraceful behavior. I was literally about to say, don't you dare come out with that? Would be dishonorable. I out oh you don't want service on training montage with grace and teaching Ochi had a peck as hard as he kicks. Now I would love to, like, learn more about how to use key with you guys because I have it now, but I haven't flavored it.

03:19:50

You know what I mean? I wasn't gonna bust it out just to use like dark vision or something in this fight. I was about to say. So this is the cat at, like, not the character asking. What did you actually take? I took forgotten trick first just cuz like I don't want to go to levels stuck with one thing and like I don't have a ton of key anyways so I want.

03:20:10

Yeah, I use whatever like we need to fix a problem like this, where people were visible, not that there's an ninja tricks that do that but like you know, to have the flexibility there and also bad. Yeah, there are. There is an indict all over. You see invisible? There is Hish Blindsense.

03:20:31

10 feet. Yeah, You can get that out of warrior poet as a move action later, but it's kind of blind sense for like, a short amount of time as move action, you know. Yeah, you better off doing, you get all the way to master trick. You start looking at like other things, but I never will because I'm multi-class tech.

03:20:55

You are kind of old. Yeah, it's you have two classes. That's not multi-class attack. I will have three. Oh no. I by the way. Abby shoot the. It is actually it's a tent bubble ninja trick called. See the unseen. What did I just say If you're asking tricks? Yes, get to master trick it is.

03:21:23

Yes I know forgotten trick. Doesn't let you take a master trick. It does not good god if it did. Yeah, That'll be fun. You can man. You can forgotten trick into vanishing trick though, which I don't plan on doing. But I'm like that's It's a good escape option. Yeah, if we really need to, that's why I took the some of the fugitive grenades like that'd be great.

03:21:46

Same deal. You know what I mean? Smoke bomb disappear into an extra dimensional space. I guess I feel like we're pretty out of character at this point. I don't think we're gonna do much else. So I was gonna ask you guys about the obsidian stuff for the wiki thing.

03:22:02

I have no, I don't think everybody's necessarily interested, the short version is there's two options. I wrote up a document explaining how you can get obsidian and get and get hub on your computer to where we can all update the same one and have access to it in relatively real time.

03:22:22

The other option is that I can publish it for like a monthly cost. Which I'm down for but obsidian has a lot of community-made plugins that are like really sick for RPG campaigns that won't necessarily translate to the website published version if I pay for it. So it'll just be this kind of wiki document with not a lot else going on, which is still great.

03:22:46

So I was gonna see gauge with the interest is if you guys are interested. I could take one person a volunteer to like run them through what you'd have to do to get it online. To that capacity. It's not super hard, but you I did have to do like, right?

03:23:04

Like three lines of code that I found in like, an article explaining it and, you know, you're opening like command window, and you feel like a hacker, I don't know what your guys's experience is, what that sort of thing, but I don't have any. So I was really intimidated at first but that's the lay on the land on that stuff.

03:23:19

I should have really looked into the ability to share or co-edit whatever I was making before. I invested this much time into it is basically the most important takeaway but it is a really powerful tool. If you guys want to be able to like, you know, right into it also then that's there's a there's a certain amount of time investment in that it's like me like and afternoon to figure it all out.

03:23:44

But now that I have I should be able to walk someone through. It fairly easily.

03:23:52

No. Need to respond. Now, I'll post more if you guys are interested, if not, I'll just do the published one and then we can have like the recaps and be able to like see while we're playing. You're like Kim and datsu. Who the heck is that? And you can click on the name.

03:24:07

And eventually, I'll have the page filled out of like Kim and Dotsy was blah, blah. They did blah blah blah. And that sort of thing.

03:24:22

It was fun. Yeah, I think. Oh Now I was only gonna say like my time is already fucked as it is. That's the only thing I get I do. I totally get. I'm I'm doing a lot of admin stuff for other things, um, but like I'm always down to If you need like our reference or just want something to the check someone over my background is that?

03:24:53

I'm I'm very much in encoding and so I'm I'm in information security so oh for sure it's really easy. It's just pushes it uses like a plugin inside of obsidian to push the vault to get hub and then other people can build the same. Like if you have obsidian with the plug in, it'll pull from that same gap It's not super complicated but I don't know nothing about that stuff.

03:25:20

So I had to do quite a bit of doodling, to figure it out, so it was easy and then we'd all be working on the same one and like if somebody writes something in it while we're playing you can see it. You know, that's sort of thing. It's a bully.

03:25:36

Hell, you have written a lot. It's actually up to date to like this to last session right now. But as you can see, if you like click on anything, most of the actual links are pretty much empty at this point, and I'd like to fill them out a little bit more.

03:25:54

But there's some of the plugins are like super, super sick for RPG stuff. They have like a map one where you can put like you know tokens with tags that link you to those pages and like build like a actual timeline on another one. There's just really, really powerful stuff.

03:26:10

I've heard people compare using this for RPGs to a thing called realm worlds that I've never used. But a lot of people like really loved and yeah. Mmm, either really powerful tools. It's just requires a lot of legwork which is fine, you know, and I don't need anybody else to like update it necessarily.

03:26:32

It's just, I feel like it's kind of a pain for me to like, export it. And have you import it like every time like before? Like, when's a good day for everybody to be able to look at it, You know what I mean? If you get it to the point where Amy, when I throw it up in there, it just pops into yours.

03:26:48

So, like the day or two, after the session, and that's a little bit more convenient for everyone. I feel like. But like I said, I could just do the published version but then I won't be able to do like the maps and the timelines and stuff like that. It'll just essentially be a text wiki.

03:27:06

I'll let everybody ponder on that. I might just have the maps of cool stuff online. I just wanted to see what the interest was before. I spent more time, making all that stuff. No, I'm looking at it through now, this is really neat.

03:27:23

You, I am always thoroughly entertained. I by people's like recapping and things. Yeah, I like lose my way between doing like first and third person and like not using certain nouns or pronouns and then using them later and then like, including the fights or not including the fights. So like the tone and the structures really inconsistent right now I mean the best thing to do is just do.

03:27:53

Whatever is like is it consistent enough that you A get that like you get enjoyment out of doing this? Because you know, obviously and I was cool and that people can generally follow it, Believe me. Yeah, I know where you're at. Because back when I was playing in a wolf, the crown game, I went out of my way to make.

03:28:16

I'm pretty sure it's still on Google sites somewhere. I'll pull it up if you really bored. My character was basically obsessive about writing a record sort of it's more of a journal and a lot of it doesn't make a lot of sense without not actively being in the game, but without like some additional information, like everybody in that game very well known NPCs, by which I mean literally like the Grand Prince of Taldor, had some sort of code name and You can work out who's, who if you're familiar with it.

03:28:55

Um, But yeah, now like keeping the consistent tone and stuff like that. I wrote that entire thing in his like like I'm not like a journal um sort of thing. So it like looking back on it, it probably doesn't make any sense to anybody else but trying to be consistent with, it is so hard.

03:29:16

I really use the restroom and my dog, just forced himself through the cat door, so something's obviously going on. Oh yeah. I think what's supposed to be going on So I hear what you're saying and like, that's why I did it. And it's already helped me just like, remember things and restructure things to, where I have a better grasp of what's going on, which is like, most of what I wanted this for, but I was like, this would be really helpful for everyone.

03:29:42

If we don't even want to go this route, if you guys are all like, fluent enough with this sort of stuff to just like, download the vault every time, then it's already going to that GitHub page that I linked and it updates like every time I get in there.

03:29:56

So if you want to know like you can just go pull it from the GitHub and it should be up to date pretty much every time.

03:30:05

So between sessions.

03:30:19

Rock and roll. I'm super stoked to be level 6. Did anybody else get? Really cool stuff. Grayson, did you get like super sick things? How do you just do the feet sizzle? Just two feets. No, big deal. You know what? I got zero feats. You got forbidden track. I can use it one time a day, don't forgot.

03:30:42

Yeah, forgotten. What time a day right now. I nearly took forgotten check myself and then I realized that like the key cost is pretty high. Actually, the key cost isn't a problem at all for now. Waterflex benefits of being a ninja monk. Yeah, definitely. Absolutely, yeah. So I know she's she's pretty good.

03:31:16

So one of the things was to do a thing that we we need someone to deal with like traps and jets. So I've sorted that out the the Nendatrack is ordinarily. I would say a very stupid idea and but no way is a very stupid person. So So out of character, this is a tiny bit revealing, if you don't want to hear it, then I shall not divulge it.

03:31:50

But there is, there is a fact that I've had in the back burner on Noah, since which kind of come into cow's Garden, learned some of the details And I don't want to hear. So I'll head off for the night so or not night but, no, I'm not gonna divulge like what it is.

03:32:06

So, just take care. Grace did So it was a thing I was like huh? I didn't think about that and now I have. So what's the thing I'm sorry? I didn't hear you. Well No, I I thought about something that we've learned as a like while we're in cow's card.

03:32:27

Mm-hmm. And I was like, hmm, This factors of thing. What should I do? Knowing this fact and I have now head cannons, what that fact is. So I've and that's related to my choice of ninja truck. There you go. That's fun stuff. I like obviously Ochi isn't mid-max because I'm doing like seven damage on average but you're you're like a samurai though.

03:32:58

So you challenge stuff and damage that's happening. Yeah. I was like when I was like, trying to run the numbers on whether or not this was going to be a waste of a character slot. I was like, I mean maybe, but like for a boss fights especially with the new order I have better will saves and much better AC against my challenge target.

03:33:16

So I think for like tank in Big Bads like it's a decent option to have OT stand there and get swung out as much as it is for anyone else. You know what I mean? Like I'm not like a heavy armor fighter, but I'm not Zeo standing there. Getting, you know, hit by like the Tetsubou, we are collectively.

03:33:34

A very agile party. Yeah, super dextrous. But yeah, I was surprised by like the challenge. Damage was like, wow, this feels so much better. Like I it's really painful to watch Grayson, just disintegrate somebody from across the map and then walk up to that same person and try and hit him into like five.

03:33:54

I mean Grayson's. Entire thing is that he's he's resign optimal. That's, that's a complete sentence. I imagine he like closes his eyes and just fires like four arrows like the where they're so fast. They almost like line up behind each other and just sink into somebody. Yeah. If I recall he's not actually like that.

03:34:18

Dextrous the dude is just doing doing the wisdom thing. So he's being very efficient and that's like a totally viable way to play. Yeah, he he fires a lot of arrows, but the moment someone uses protection from arrows, right? Yeah. Somebody uses wind wall or snatching. Exactly. Like there's, there's problem So he month leaps at them and kicks him in the face.

03:34:49

Yeah. But he's got to actually monthly and do that and if I recall can Zen arches, even flurry of blows but they can still fury blows but still glory. It was. Yep. It's interesting interesting. Yeah, I mean they don't lose period blows with their fists. They just get confirm, you blow with their with a bow.

03:35:11

Yeah. And well I'm really liking the current party makeup. I think it's going really well. Sorry, again for stepping on, like, ninja toes. I just wanted, I want to flavor it as less like sneaking attack and more. You know, he's just like really precise with where he's doing a stab and I won't be ninja for too many more levels.

03:35:33

I just want to get that key pool, dude, you you are not stepping on any ninja toes. If anything I feel bad. Because unfortunately she says um at least at the moment Noah's characterization is that she's kind of a bitch and it's annoying for me to try and find ways to like keep truth to her kind of chaotic nature.

03:36:02

While also, you know, not being an asshole and I'm hoping that I'm kind of getting out the ideas is that I get, you know. She yeah we'll stop. Yeah, that's the other thing with this. Huge document thing is I want to get myself more into the fiction. So I want to lean more into the character.

03:36:20

I'm having trouble doing the lawful good thing OG's. Kind of drifted somewhat from like his original character concept mostly because of like the party makeup and like the backstory that I came up with after building him out and I'm like okay that doesn't make sense with like who he is and what happened to him and stuff.

03:36:38

So I'm just trying to make him more realized and act that a little better. Yeah, it's usually what happened? Those days you come up with an idea and then you bring them to a table and as with anything, no plans, survives first contact, with the party. So just kind of flex into what you kind of want to be or what makes the most sense.

03:37:04

Yeah, No and I think I definitely want like an alignment shift towards neutral like part of the the samurai order that not the Samurai in the Cavalier ordered. But I mean, same thing it's a time. Yeah, for like being the first line of defense against like the Oni. And in this case, for the, the royal family.

03:37:23

Like he's, it says, right in? Like the very first flavor text block of the order that it's like, they don't give shit about good, or evil or, right, or wrong. They just want to protect the state of the world from the supernatural forces that would seek to destroy it.

03:37:37

And I'm like, that's what he would do. He would see this threat of the only of the five storms and see Amako and be like, I have to stop this. That's my job. Now, you know, yeah, that's like super red. And I think that's like a good thing to have as a as a samurai because Samurai Cavalier any other kind of class combination that gives you an order.

03:38:03

Like having that thing is like, it's your equivalent to the paladin code of conduct, right? Yeah. So, develop the character. Exactly. Exactly. Gives you like a framework to kind of be like, no matter what this is. This is the thing. Yeah, I was like, I always was like, kind of playing with the idea of like switching it, but then as soon as Sans was like, oh Mako just like nights you on the spot.

03:38:29

I was like, fuck this advances my character development so fast and so far. Yeah, that's like super cool because it was fun. Yeah. Anyways. Sorry, I'll chat all day about. OG I'm terrible like that because I have no one in my real life to talk to you about it.

03:38:48

Yo you too. Yeah, mood. Yeah, big mood. Yeah. Big made Ben I can I can talk like stuff like that. I love hearing about how people like want to move their characters through things and who actually have an interest in the roleplay side of it lonely. Yeah, I mean like the way, the way that I came into it was like I played a little bit before but then I started listening to all these actual play podcasts and they just like scratch this itch that I didn't know that I had.

03:39:19

And a lot of them. Just do like fantastic roleplay and backstories and I'm like fuck. That's so cool, man. Like, if I wanted to play a video game, I go play a video game and look at big numbers, you know, I wanted. Yeah, I want to exactly do a character concept and that's super like, fun and cool.

03:39:36

The original one was more of like a sneaky leaning more into the Tango-ness of like stealing and like gaslighting everyone around them about the stealing, you know, it was gonna be like a maroku-esque character from like Inuyasha with his like little staff. He's just oh, yeah, you know, and then like pull out like all these hidden weapons and just like go hard in the paint whenever there was a fight and then just go back to being like, oh, this is really cool.

03:40:06

I'm gonna take this. They're like no, he's like, this is Tango tradition. You're supposed to give me a gift and then now he's like this level. Good child. Who has lost the sassy lost child? Um, yeah no, I love Archie. I think. I think he's like he's really from my perspective, he's really fun to play off.

03:40:28

I have a lot of fun just thinking, like, wow, this this dude is just naive enough. Yeah, and I wanted to believe in the goodness of all things and I am just cynical enough to be like found. Yeah I think it's really fun and that's why I want to get into the fiction of it more is I think he's a really good foil for like the uncaring Grayson and like the ultra like selfish and chaotic no way and the like old and like bitter shoko.

03:40:59

You know what I mean to have this kid following him around or like takes himself really seriously? Because of Mako was like I don't give a shit about tradition. You're a samurai now, you know, like Yeah, like the narratively, the role that I would want to, to make, you know, I kind of go down.

03:41:18

I already kind of know where she'll end up being probably very quickly. You guys wrap up. The frozen shadows is the.

03:41:33

Okay, this is the only way I can really describe it in short term. So in the, in the fall flowing future of whatever she survives. All of this. I'm hoping that she's the kind of character that is look, you you don't ask me for help or anything because I probably already done the thing.

03:41:58

Mmm, you know? Yeah. She's like I I really want to make sure that the people I like and the people that I genuinely love all protected and the length that I will go to ensure that are vicious like secret service level get down, Mr. President while I shoot this guy in the head, Like that's a reducer or anything but like a black widow sort of character art where Yeah, it's really reductionist but it is kind of.

03:42:29

But yeah, it does apply though. I think the only difference is that, at least the kind of the the MCU renditional Chicago, at the very least, is much more moral. Yeah, no way is not and she's not designed to be. If anything perspective on whether or not you should kill someone, or is very much colored by like, look, if you're not alive, then you're no longer really a problem.

03:43:07

Unless you come back as a dead thing in which case if I just hide you, well enough, you probably won't be able to come back as a dead thing, and if you do, it won't be anywhere near anyone. I care about. Yeah. That's so some fun flavors right there.

03:43:20

Yeah. She's, she's supposed to be that kind of mentality, but there is there is like an angle, um, about her. That hoping will have a chance to come out. Because At the very bit, like off, coming off of the back of Brandall. If a party hadn't interacted nearly as like as much and didn't react as they did to, like, by the way, kind of kind of an indigo assassin.

03:43:53

That was supposed to kill your boss, kind of thing, The whole kimon Dotsu. I will come in of colder, ally thing. Yeah. No. I would have kept swinging. Mmm, interesting. So so that is character development, that's not me as the player being like I'm not gonna do this because that fuck your your party over.

03:44:13

We were just all being like generally kind to you a little bit like asking these questions. It's like seeming to give a shit about you. And then you're like these people are kind of nice to me. I think our killed yet More importantly. At least, from Again, I'm being incredibly sappy here.

03:44:33

But from hope perspective, every single time she's had to tell somebody her real name, she's had to kill them and that's not a like oh no. Now I have to kill you thing. It's a that's that's the best sentence thing. And the only people that have ever known her name have been people that she's hated mmm, like genuinely fucking hated.

03:44:53

Nobody has pretty much everybody who's called her Hatsuyuki has plus how to track record for some sort of abuse against her. I would imagine I don't and she is like, okay, like, as my name, it's my background. This is Michael on. I'm assuming that, you know, this information you will want me.

03:45:16

Get. Yeah, I mean like, as a as a rule, that's pretty much what's happened every time. Right. There was some extra cool stuff that I hope we get to learn about just to mentions and like I made they're in the wiki and everything and they're just floating because if you go to the little cool graph view, I have like 12 or 14 dots or so, they aren't connected anything.

03:45:37

And like half of them are just from no ways like character back. I want to know I need these right to connect to other things. So I guess if These are not just going to be random facts, you probably will have like just talked with no about at some point.

03:45:55

Maybe so, you know they're not hidden or anything. Just might have had this conversation over dinner or something or ask Um over Innobushi wine, an individual wine. Exactly. And remember she yeah we we stand plum. Wine in this house is the like If you ask if you ask a you know she's she's responded generally speaking.

03:46:17

Yeah, I'm I'm predominantly erotucky Tian. If you ask what type of Tian she looks at you blank and goes, I have no idea a gathered that. Yeah, yeah. So I think she's like I think my father was somewhere in Honggol which suggests Tian like on. Yeah. It's it's probably not though, because my name is written in Tianshu.

03:46:48

But my name itself is Mikayan Very concealed for us who are like from Chancho like, you know, exactly. And and this kind of leads into like my name is haiku and you're like clearly like Chinese and not just yeah, she's she's she's some amount of amalgamation of she's either Tianju or Mankayan or John Hamp.

03:47:18

Like it's one of those ones. I basically just put flappy hands. I'm gone. Hey, like the ancestry is Medgayan. But that was like 1500 fucking years ago house, right? Yeah, so not relevant to me really at this point. Exactly, exactly. And There is a tiny bit, a little bit, a little bit of a ego but is like half a very, very good reason for why I want to kill all of the frozen shadows in cows.

03:47:57

God, is not even because it's a good idea. It's because when they ask about the first and shadows clan, I get to say that's me. There's one that is really sick. That's a badass character. That's that's one. No, he's going for. She's like you want to talk to the frozen shadow?

03:48:16

That's me. Yeah. The frozen shadow Because once you because she'll admit they have agents all over in the Innocity but their agents. Oh, so they probably don't actually know like any of the ninja techniques or anything. No, So performance and stuff like that. Exactly. So the moment that this is cleared out and you kill them at the root, they're on a morphos and shadows, except for me, the only true frozen shadow.

03:48:46

That's super sick, right? It's so incredibly stupid. And She's like, I am the one. There could be only one. You can be only one that's that is honestly like, it's the dumbest thing. And it wasn't really something that I had in her characterization until we came to Calsguard and just started fucking around.

03:49:07

And I was like, okay, we've now decided that she's actually like Big C chaotic As opposed to like, little see that it was supposed to be. Yeah. When you were like, yeah, I'm not gonna go that far in. And then you like did the whole Rye burner skill, like, without us.

03:49:27

I was like, oh, yeah, this is, this is good to go bad at some point One day. This is. Okay. So So here's here's the tea with that because I know that some people made some certain large explorations of air. I went like that. Could have gone really bad.

03:49:43

You know Like yes, Yes, I know that madness But unfortunately I have played Pathfinder for 20 Well 3.5. So If I think this character can get away I probably can. Yeah. If there's anyone character that could get away really easily is the ninja too. You can vanish your way out of there.

03:50:06

Key points, get the speed and just and just disappear. Yeah just disappear climb up a fucking wall. Like do something just has acrobatics out. They asked to at least run like yeah, one of the cool things made for doing it just stuff. One of the cool things I wanted to do with OG is like flavor.

03:50:25

Some of the key is like him learning from Grayson in a way either like with their help or just like watching and discovering that in himself. But one of the other ones I got psychic, sensitivity is a bonus feat from my order but I also got like knowledge planes and knowledge Arcana.

03:50:45

And there's like all kinds of cool stuff you can do with knowledge plan. So I'm like debating taking flickering step like very very late game just for like utility which I think of you can have also being debating flickering. Yeah you know what I mean? Like just utility of like he can see through the planes.

03:51:03

Like he's like another level of like knowing about the supernatural world just like we need to get the fuck out of here. Everybody grab hands and we all just teleport like not because he's like powerful just because like he knows you know like the right place to like just step through existence.

03:51:20

Yeah. No, I mean if no way survives long enough, I am fully intending that she is going to be like when you think of. So in traditional media, when you think of the ninja, you think of like Oh these people who like our known for assassinations and sneaking into places and being able to kill you in your sleep and that kind of thing, right?

03:51:49

But there's also the other angle of it where people where you can like When ninjas often disguise themselves as certain like commoners or you know Geisha in order to get themselves into a position of particular interest. And yeah um like that side of it is actually no way especialty if you what you ask her.

03:52:11

She's like, I am very good at killing people, but the thing that I was trained to do is get information, which is why. Um, if you use a disguise you toll like any kind It automatically, get a check against it. Mm-hmm. So that's the frozen shadow archetype, right? Yep.

03:52:31

Yeah, I looked at it because I was like, you know, you get the pathfinder disease of like how could I make the most unique character to ever live? And you just stack archetypes on archetypes. And like so I went through all of them. Yeah, no. They the frozen shadow rocketype I would actually argue is pretty bad though.

03:52:50

It definitely is. But you don't see me trying to be a frozen shadow ninja. I'm like, if you have the right circumstance of the prior knowledge of like, what the campaign or like the, you know, whatever you're running is gonna be like, obviously. All skills are useful in certain situations but like in the Pathfinder mathy sense, like they're not great abilities.

03:53:09

Yeah, losing uncanny. Dogs sucks like it, just deals. I didn't think that was gonna be as large of a worry as it's, it's a huge problems campaign. Fucking yeah. Late. Getting getting flanked is like super fucking for me but conversely, I don't intend to be in a position where I ever will be caught out like that.

03:53:32

Yeah, it's oh she's not gonna do any invisibility stuff. But warrior poet. One of the elective abilities is get uncanny Dodge and then also dipping it a ninja. So I could stack them and get them as if I was, you know, a ninja of whatever level. Unfortunately, the bill doing two up and fighting as you know his feet intensive.

03:53:55

So like, you know, getting into those things, it's a little less fee intensive. The problem with warrior poet is that warrior poet is built to do. It's it's built for vital strike. Yeah. That's why I'm like kind of ditching out of it. When I am, like, I want to lean into the key stuff to boost the damage instead of relying on doing that one trick.

03:54:17

Like obviously like spring attack is really great if you don't want to get hit but I just I didn't want to stay 16 or 18 levels of like this one doing this specific thing in combat every time. Yeah especially if you do with like a magnada, I think it's way better or a glaze.

03:54:36

Yeah, it is. You know what it means? Like it's just the build doesn't even really work unless you're using a big fat weapon like that. Yep. So it's like I'm gonna do other things and I've changed my mind on it like a million times. Like now dude, I got this point your conversation today about what fucking like ninja tricks.

03:54:56

I was going to take at level six and I was like, oh, we're leveling to six. And I'm like yeah, at this point like what I want OG to be able to do is to just try and keep up on damage with everybody else and I'm gonna take bar and brawler and use that in combination with forgotten trick to just try and be good at whatever we're dealing with at the time.

03:55:16

And otherwise have like critical focus. And that enough to weapon fighting feeds, it was pretty baller, especially with them. But the elephant in the room yeah it works out a lot better without having to have all the improved feats to do everything Dear God. Yet us There would be no way on this planet.

03:55:40

That no way would have been built to be empty monk. Yeah, and I still want to talk to Shoko about it because I haven't, but I wanted to do this. Wash dip. Also just to get Perry and repost because I think that's like exactly the kind of thing. The Ochi would do, you know what I mean?

03:55:56

But yeah, like I see, I see kind of where you're at and

03:56:06

The thing I would normally suggest I can't suggest because you're a samurai ordinately. In this case, I would have gone, You could go swash, or you could go Cavalier daring champion, but you obviously can't. Yeah, unlimited myself. But I mean, Maybe he died. I've already got a backup like that could, you know, weigh down the road as we get closer to Tianjah could take over.

03:56:32

But like, it's taking care of, by the seal, but I would much rather like the character die if it's not working or if like he actually dies. Oh yeah. There's like a good narrative cut off. Like that would be like I I'm always for the narrative and like, okay player enjoyment is king, you know?

03:56:54

Yeah. And disability dies like defending a mako in the quest to get her two Ming Kai like 10 out of 10, you know what I mean? Even if it's not cool like I'm gonna I'm gonna make it cool in my head. Like, yeah. That's that's like, the best way to kind of look at it.

03:57:14

And and those situations And yeah, if your character doesn't work out, then it doesn't work out. I'm gonna be honest, I wasn't entirely sure now is was going to work out because frankly I didn't know whether or not the party was going to just be all like all right, you dead?

03:57:29

I don't know. That's a tough one. I don't know. I haven't been enough games. I've there's a really funny moment in one of the actual plays that I've listened to where they're like deep in a dungeon when somebody dies and the way, they introduce another character like it's just really hilarious but the one of the original characters, but not that ones was like, I have all these questions for you.

03:57:54

How did you get here? Who are you? And can you cure blindness? And then the guy who's introducing the new character is, like, I'm gonna answer those in reverse order. I can't care blindness. And then the original person was like, kill him immediately. Yeah, there's like those moments are hilarious.

03:58:19

Yeah, I I definitely did those moments for sure. I am. I'm a big proponent of I guess at the narrative and just player enjoyment and having fun with it. And I definitely feel like a I talked too much and my games like collectively you and me both, I think these other people, they are a little bit more here for the hack and slash.

03:58:47

So I try and roll it back to a point where we're just trying to move the story forward, you know, I mean like I want to get my my character notes in because that's how I enjoy this. But like, you know, I want to get to the fight so that Grayson isn't like why the hell am I paying to do 15 minutes?

03:59:04

Yeah fight, but it takes four hours of my day. You know what I mean? Yep. Yeah. I do. I I definitely understand that for sure. It's, it's kind of rough to balance that out. I mean, I got a lot of enjoyment out of roleplay. Stupid shit. That's why when you guys were fighting the ocher jelly, I was like, I ain't doing dick the way over here, double Dover and dying with Koya.

03:59:28

The way, when I like that was probably one of my favorite moments that I've done in this campaign so far is when Joka was like, no, you're supposed to throw rocks is like, don't I came up here so that I could tank it with my major images and I just stepped back and shot it with the two there.

03:59:43

Oh, it's like, yeah, you got it. Go for it. Yes, which is why I was just like I am not fighting a giant pudding. Yeah, No I just didn't have much self-respect at all and she has no concept of shame frankly. But That one was like my mind. I am not fighting.

04:00:04

I walking. I'm not home. That's you in the tapioga. Could go out at alone. Yeah. Yeah. You can you in the tofu can have a good fight over there. I am not touching that problem. Anyways, I could ramble all day. It's always nice talking to you about this stuff.

04:00:18

Like I think you and I are on a very similar page and what we're enjoying about this campaign and what like we could chat about. So glad to having probably good for a while. But yeah. Sorry to sorry to keep you man. No, you're good. I'm just I'm hungry.

04:00:30

I didn't need enough breakfast. Today food is important. You should definitely. My girlfriend is like eight and a half months pregnant right now. So I have to feed her also or she'll relations. Thank you. We're super, super excited. We're making a main character. We're naming him wolf game. So oh my god, amazing.

04:00:48

Yeah, right. Super stoked about that. I gotta build a grill like this weekend. Well, honestly, my best to look for that and congratulations to you both. I hope everything goes well But yeah, Duke get some food. It is. It's good time. Thanks. I'll see you around. See you next week **la****ter** did
