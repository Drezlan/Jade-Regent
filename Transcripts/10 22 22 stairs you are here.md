00:00

Of the limbics crucibels, burners and assorted tools, as well as a large glass case holding what appears to be a humanoid body. A variety of dried herbs and plants tangle, and perfusion from hooks on the bottoms of the stairs and sax, and chest holding additional equipment components, have been shoved underneath the stairs, a torch mounted on one of the stairs post illuminates, the chamber with a flickering glow,

00:32

So I don't whether knowledge checks,

00:41

We didn't do any on them, but I see. On the wasp. Oh, there's the planes. I'm sorry. I did one and Zeo did dungeon nearing. That's right.

00:57

Do they sprechen?

01:04

Interesting question. They do have an intelligence of six.

01:11

And understanding for only, it looks like

01:20

Oh yes, yes they do. They do speak. In fact.

01:28

So terrifying only, let's not talk to them. Only infernal, though, I mind when hell wasps swarms together. They gain an intelligence of six and the ability to use skills and feats and can speak infernal with a voice made up of an amalgamation of their constant. Droning, I have more of a big curiosity to hear what that sounds like.

01:51

That would be super cool. I mean, I definitely don't have the vocal structure required to reproduce that, no, I get that. I'm just like, that's you know, what I mean? That's, that's really cool.

02:08

And so inside that knowledge check, do we know they're alignment as being like hecka, evil, definitely evil. Okay. They are bourbon from hell literally.

02:29

And so their prerogative is to like, go around and do more, horrible wasp stuff to people and make more wasps, they're gonna crawl inside your body, eat out all of your insights and then lay more hellwah, figs than you.

02:46

Not necessarily in that order. These are extreme. That's fun. Evil creatures. I say we open it and take them out at Ochi's. Gonna just put a hand on your shoulder. I don't, I don't think that's a very good idea. Grayson. I say we leave these where they are and just gonna concurrent poppy and paste their defensive line or you guys.

03:27

Wow.

03:32

It's swarm. Can't even be killed the normal ways. I'm sorry. Does that say immune weapon damage? Oh,

03:45

Oh, that's so terrifying.

03:51

Swarms are serious business. Kind of insane. Yep. And this worm has improved initiative and toughness and the stealth of plus 24. That is insane. There's a reason they said to make sure that the players don't open this tube. You think were killing you. Wow. Okay, let's let's be moving on, huh?

04:30

Don't believe we did treasure for this room yet though. I don't see anything in the chat. No, I don't think we did. I think we ended before that. So, he stands just, you know, and here in three hours, I will have to take off.

04:57

And I got another game. That's not really nice that meet want a read around the week. It's okay. Excuse me. Do you need to be burped? I'm pretty good at that. Now and everything. Now being held, tenderly padded on the back.

05:22

Okay. Yeah stuff. We didn't even kill anything in here. We just walked in here. We get free stuff. Pretty cool Me too.

05:37

I'm

05:42

Yeah, I will say that seems like a pretty damn good deal. Yeah, It's pretty heavy amount of stuff. But that's what we brought way in, for he can totally carry that.

05:57

The monkey kind of just looks at you. Affronted A ringer counter spells, an empty ring of counter spells.

06:18

And we came up from here. So, we haven't actually come across this staircase yet here, which I'm good leads up.

06:38

You would be correct in this. Okay, let's can we unpause? So we can move around. I was going to. Yep. So sorry, visually see the staircase and just confirm that it goes up. In case we need to retreat to familiar territory. I can't collides with the wall.

07:04

Do we work? Are we going to try to take all the equipment and components? Just because it weighs so much since we don't have a bag of holding that that we have to put stuff in.

07:20

One bag of holding yet? No, no, he has one but she hasn't really shared it with the group. Yeah, we need to get our hands on one So perhaps we can just grab it on our way out. Instead of lugging it all around currently, I'm gonna call out, this doesn't look super familiar up here.

07:39

I think this goes somewhere else, I thought it went back to the main floor. I mean most I have a handy habitat but that's a handy hackersack.

07:52

And having no one following him OG's, gonna take some more steps forward.

08:00

The OG has ended up the stairs.

08:05

Why do you think wrong you guys outside the wall, you know?

08:14

That was just weird. Oh, by the way Ochi you want to do? You want a buff. I will take a buff. A heroism. Oh, hell yeah.

08:34

I'll go find that.

08:47

Agnancy with us. Oh yeah, yeah. I'm here. I'm here. I think I'll definitely just be following OG. I went up these stairs.

09:05

Sorry computers a little slow today. You might wait for check out. Yeah, this all doesn't look familiar. The shoot must have been longer than we thought.

09:36

There's a room over here. The Stonewalls turned to heavy timbers. As this tower climbs above the long haul, This landing is dark limited. Only by what little light spills from the room below a steep narrow stare lacking any railing rises through it. Opening in the ceiling. 20 feet above be honest.

09:56

I guess I I got lost. Where is everyone? You're right behind me if there's oh sorry. No, he's not.

10:13

I tried to go up those stairs and it took me to well back down. So,

10:24

Anyway, beyond the stairs, a door side room. Which is that door there? I'm gonna check and see if it's trapped question. Mark very well.

10:43

Just a cursory. Look at it before. We touch it.

10:49

I don't know about you but I suspect there's someone on the other side named Jorgen the ax. Yeah. It wasn't a hidden, right? I know I've realized that after

11:05

Those sort of trappings about it. Nope, no. Trappings OT's. Gonna try the door handle to see if it's locked. It is also not lost. Okay, everybody with me. I'm gonna swing this bad boy open. Perhaps stealthily. Can I do that? You certain again?

11:32

I will attempt to follow stealthily. Oh, hell yeah, dude.

11:39

Well, it's a good thing. Batches on sale checks aren't auto failures. Yeah. Because your botch still beat his limit. So, oh cheese gonna be like quietly. Now, everyone and then open the door a little bit. I'll see, see if I manage it for people. Oh, I also botched, boom, your total is also still higher than his perception role.

12:14

You see this wear bear sitting at a desk with a bottle of wine, this chamber, actually, reaps of stale wine, ring, sweat and wild animals for a rough bed. Sits at the far end in a pot belly stove, rests between the windows next to a cold bucket cross on the stove is a small table holding several empty wine skins and a small oaken statue wet where the werebear Jordan.

12:44

The ax is currently sitting. There are currently, we were told that this wear bear wouldn't normally be serving them if it weren't the fact that he was being magically forced to. Yep. Yeah we had a knowledge check at one point. I think somebody I don't know if you actually anybody actually rolled it, but you did share with us.

13:09

That normally wear bears are lawful good. That is correct. So then we would know that he sort of being forced to do all this stuff against his will, right? Mm-hmm, OG's. Gonna attempt to stealthily, close the door. If that oh looking around the room is can we when we be able to just sneak past him like onto the next rooms?

13:30

I don't know. The room, there's this is just like a whole off this bedroom. Yeah, this is a little back bedroom. There doesn't go anywhere else. So but I'll share that information with everybody. I want to close Do I need to do another separate check to stealthily close the door so that he can possibly do.

13:47

Another check later and spot us. I will let you make another self-check for it but it will also get him another perception. Check. I'm doing it.

14:02

We I'm so glad he rolled poorly. Okay, Ochi closes the door and he's gonna turn to everyone in a really hush voice and say, the wear bears on the other side of the store. I don't necessarily want to cause any harm to him. He's being control. This none of the things that he's doing or to his normal attitude or will.

14:25

I think we should maybe leave him be for the time being. There's no other rooms in there where I think a mako could be. It's just his bedroom.

14:35

Does the door. Have a lock on it. I don't it, I don't know. That's something when you find out but I don't think that a door will stop him. He's aware bear. It will not, he's aware bear with a great ax. He's a very big rare bear. If anything I think it might alarm him and cause him to go running around and searching everywhere.

15:00

If he decides to, I don't know, come out and check on something doesn't look like anyone has raised an alarm yet and he is perfectly content to drown his sorrows and wine for the moment. I think I'm really leaving him to his pain. I'm surprised that huge fight at the entrance wasn't having the alarm raised, they're very cool.

15:22

One of the ninjas managed to get away.

15:30

I will also point out to everyone that I don't know if he saw me and I don't know if the GM is aware, but over here, if anybody could see my marker that far away, I did also spot our Raven buddy. So I think we should be careful because he tends to stir up.

15:46

A lot of trouble and noise wherever he appears that is on a different level. So you didn't actually see that. Okay. Just making sure one of the point that out. Like, what's the extra quiet? I don't think we want to bring another big fight to ourselves before. We can possibly get our hands on a mako.

16:02

So let's head back. Perhaps up the stairs further or down the stairs because we came from these stairs here. There were other doors down here. Yeah, down on the other level but I was trying to get back up to the main level. So we know how to get back.

16:30

You should check the other doors down there. Oh gee. Here's the voice of God and they go back downstairs.

16:51

And mix tiles are acting weird. Hold on, Where they go.

16:59

I'm outside.

17:08

I'm hanging up. And meanwhile, no way has just been sitting in here staring at the wasps making faces of them. I can't move stuck in a loop. I got you.

17:29

Much as they wanted to keep using the maps from the books. I might have to actually make my own. These maps were not designed for VTT. So we just went down These stairs or is that's where we, that's where we came up. So we just went up. He came down these ones.

17:49

Well to get back down right now but I mean previously yeah to get here from the lower level, where the sword was we came up from those stairs and just now, we went Also up those stairs and checked all that stuff out. And then came back down the same stairs.

18:04

I'm just trying to orient myself. You are correct. Okay.

18:13

Oh, she's gonna step up to this one and just track. Try the handles. See if it's locked. It is not. So he cracks it open and then slowly opens it. And what do we see? Boom. I don't actually have description for this hallway. You said it's a cool hallway kind of it's a cool hallway kind of long.

18:39

I really like, I think about it all the time. When you say every voila, that pops into my head all the time like at work and stuff.

18:52

It This way is empty. Wait, if they're supposed to be a description and looks like I'm missing a number somewhere. This room is full of this hallway. Is full of 500 Helwasps, Huh? There is a description for. It just doesn't have a number on it. This cramped, corridor runs from one side of the long haul to the other multiple doors open.

19:15

At either end in all manner of boxes bags, chests and crates have been stacked against the walls. The Raptors hold hooks and nets from which hang additional supplies, a staff room, Wait, other than sound right? Is that? Well, it isn't. No problem. It is and could be another one of the adjacent.

19:40

Okay? Now that's definitely C10. Let's see. All the various tools equipment and non-perishable supplies necessary for the maintenance and up Ravens, cracker stored in this hallway, Nearly any sort of mundane tool can be found here, including a portable forage, and a set of masterworks Smith's tools. Yo Hmm. One in everyone is a room of stuff.

20:13

Excuse me. Kristen's gonna go to this other door down here, and it's gonna try opening it really. It's just little. Listen at it first.

20:27

Emiru 30 there. It sounds like there's someone in there. Oh, she's gonna. That sounds humanoid. I. Yeah, I mean, it sounds like a human breathing and Christian'll turn to Ochi and just kind of given odd until Oh she's gonna draw his weapons. Eric Cousin all all open the door.

21:05

Not stalkfully. That door is locked, Right? He points at no way and like Beckens her towards the door.

21:20

I am no way. Pushes glasses up nose immediately picks the lock immediately picks the lock and then steps to the side. I'll go through first Ochi will do exactly what Grayson would have done and just open the door. Oh cool. There's a guy, there is a guy who is clearly emaciated and malnourished.

21:52

Kind of pushed up against the back wall. As the light pours into his one stark room, he closes his eyes and pain of No, no. My name is loot, guys. There's sick loot in here who are recent shoots an arrow at Ochi's. The back of his neck. I was looking at loose one.

22:25

That did it. Oh, she's looking at looking at Lou. What does he look like? Is he like doing recognize like the color is he's wearing or it looks like he was once dressed and buying merchants guard. But the months that he spent in this room subsisting on the very meager food that they give him and likely whatever rats, he was able to catch has left him very weak from malnutrition and fever Though.

23:00

He doesn't seem to have any major injuries on him. Oh, she's gonna put his swords away. And take a knee in front of this guy and tell him, We mean you no harm. We're here looking for some of our friends. We're we're not here to hurt you. In any way?

23:18

What is your name? I'm Ochi. Ochi Suite, loot hackers sly. Hello Lou. Nice to meet you. Don't? I wish you don't work for silver score. No, I wish we were meeting under better circumstances. We are very much at odds with the deceptive. Silver score. Do you know? Silver scores?

23:42

True nature.

23:49

Yes, she seems to be some sort of strange. Purplish. Red ogre. She is an only in a demon in that odds, with my liege, who they've captured, have you heard or seen them bring anyone in since you've been here? How long have you been here? I don't know. I lost count of the days.

24:11

I was a member of the Reim Runner, Guild Board of shareholders. I voted against a measure that she proposed and I was taken in the night and brought here. Well, we can really have for you. You seem to be of good nature and upstanding nature. We're happy to help you get out of here.

24:37

We just need to find our friends. First We are looking for the guide off Gormander as well as bookshaka the apprentice and our our dear friend Amico. Then we find a shaka looks tied up. Yeah, that should be here with us actually. No. Because she was really injured or something she pointed that she got blinded.

25:06

Yeah. Okay. See important things. I left out, she's hiding in a side room up here. We're looking for Grayson sense motive, this guy. And what he has said, so far you are more than welcome to.

25:26

The DC was only five. He is completely and utterly telling the truth. Ochistel he knew for the beginning JK Are you well enough to travel? I think Ochi knows that about a lot of people. Oh, she's a very trusting person.

25:52

He's a bird of his word, man. I will travel to get away from this terrible place. There's,

26:08

There's another one like her. We don't is green with big tusks. He was the one that questioned me the most. It wasn't silver score. But another only you think like silverscore. He was green though, not like her. Hmm, that's very good to know. Thank you for sharing. Have you seen any other special dangers folk like that around.

26:42

We've seen many of the frozen shadows themselves. But no, no leaders. Like Kim and Dotsu so far silver score. So even her name is false, you'd be correct.

27:03

I heard someone being dragged in a couple of days ago, She was putting up quite the fight. That's good to know that she was still alive when she was brought here. Like we said, we're more than happy to help you escape this place but we do have business to attend to first.

27:23

If you're well enough that you think you can go down, you're we won't stop you but it might be best to wait until we've maybe dealt with some more of and enforces that dwell here. I am in no condition to make the truck all the way back to Kel's garden.

27:40

If there's a place I may wait for you nearby. Yeah we could we this is room nearby or another companion of ours is waiting. You could join her there. Yes, we could put you with oakshaka and you could help watch over each other. I know Shaka and gold Goremenders names.

28:04

They are good. People just very acceptable. Yes, she was blinded and we did not want to endanger her more. So, perhaps you can watch over each other. If anyone comes, I will tell her where to swing. That would be perfect.

28:24

So and he'll reach out a hand for him and kind of if he wants to put his arm over your shoulder and help him walk and then escort him over to where Okshaka is hanging out. We have a spare blade for this. Fine gentleman. I got a dagger. I can give him.

28:41

I'm sure. I I may look a proud alphan but I have little skill in arms. God, used the wrong answer. Like some protection still better than nothing though. At this point, I will fight to live. If you can spare weapon, I will take it. That is good. You like to hear that?

29:12

Why don't you tell us more about what what they've kept you here for? He said they've been asking you questions. What kind of questions? I don't know, really and I don't understand the goatee. The one that keeps questioning me. I don't know what he's after.

29:41

Can you give us an example of a question that he asked you?

29:50

He was the one that handled my food and he would ask me how I felt after I ate it. Oh, show goes going to cast. Detect magic. There's there's nothing going on with them.

30:15

Is Kaya with us. Koya Korea. I'll get poison, there's nothing currently afflicting him, but there's a bit of a lingering trace of poison like someone was testing poisons on him. Mmm.

30:39

Not an enviable position to be in. Let's get you off to Ushaka. You should be safer there. So we'll throw him over my shoulder a little bit and walk him towards the door. We were out before thinking.

31:08

Well, all right. See, nine. You guys have not been in here yet. I don't think no. So, boom, is oakshaka where the shoot is at? Cheers. She's in this room here. Okay, wine and food stores. This room is dark and cold and numerous barrels, baskets and sacks are stacked about the room butchered carcasses primarily sheep, but a few hogs as well, along with bundles of roots, tubers and herbs.

31:39

Hang from the wooden rappers overhead. And in one corner sits a clay pot filled with what looks like fresh honeycomb.

31:52

Tank.

31:57

Where did everyone go? I'm sorry, I think I want, I took the wrong path.

32:08

Very. Did you go? Oh, there you are. Hold on. I'll move you.

32:22

Okay.

32:26

The food stuff room and keep in mind. I've got the tech magic up for six minutes. So tell me if that means anything it does not. It's mundane food stuffs in here. And this room is Bart from the side. All you have to do is lift the bar up and it unlocks the door.

32:43

Oh, she will ask Grayson or showco to come over and grab the other side of a bar? Because he's only got one arm right now. Kristen why He's helping the old man walk. Okay, we'll pop those bad boys off.

33:06

Really wish I could slow down that fire animation.

33:12

It's moving like way too fast. That is not safe fire.

33:20

And it's not great.

33:29

Stay. Well, friends, boom, we will come back. When we have Mako in hand.

33:39

Is that the bird that I smell? Yes, we found one of the previous board members of the Rheim Runner's Guild that they took who defied Kim and Dotsu. He's very ill. We brought him here to help. Watch your back and keep both of you safe.

34:04

Come friends. You will be my eyes and I will make you a pulses to help with your Everything situation. Yes. I also have some jerky here. Oh, hell yeah. Oh geez. Like kind of get something. We think them have been testing poisons on him, So these probably still got a bit of that, in this system.

34:27

OT now realizes, there's a door in this room that I don't know that we've been through before. You have not. He's gonna just try that handle real quick. It opens just fine. Let's see. Full moon. This is eight little boom. All right, last session at some point. No. All right because on 35 health I should be at full health.

35:05

Yeah. Yep. You got a full rest. So after actually searching this room now, you do find all of this.

35:28

That's cool. A bunch of swag, a bunch of swag.

35:36

All right, watch over each other. We must continue on Be safe.

35:49

What do you guys think? Which way should we go? I guess back to all the humor they were like to the doors that we haven't been to.

36:09

Oh, we at night. There's one other don't we haven't meant to yet?

36:21

He'll check the door for traps.

36:28

It may perception. Check. What is this See? Denote. Does that denote anything that we can see in the feeling? There's a trapdoor. Oh, what is the ceiling? I'm pretty sure it's the ceiling. Yes, a trapdoor in the ceiling. That is not hidden. Oh, there's a door to the south here, too.

36:55

I didn't even see that if you don't find any traps and you hear the distinct sound of looking.

37:08

The real sex back.

37:13

He says I hate cooking. I hate clicking sounds. I don't know what it is, but it's looking. I'm gonna try the handles here. If it's locked. It's not locked. Stealthily crack the door open.

37:33

Oh boy. You, you

37:54

Wow. Okay, So you said four frozen shadow ninjas just going about their day cooking.

38:05

Yeah, they are cooking a meal closet in there in their full like face masks up ninja suits on, but wearing aprons like drop in like shots hats. That would be really amazing though. And that's gotta be the ratatouille easter egg in here. Dude, there has to be. There has to be a link to stacked field.

38:30

Stones. Roofed with steeply. Sloping thatch has been constructed against the walls of the main hall and adjacent cliff base. You massive ovens occupy, the south wall and a number of tables, and trestles have been set up about the room for food preparation.

38:49

OG's gonna leave the door, just slightly a jar so you can see through it and not touch it and turn around and just tell everybody. There's, there's several more than ninjas in here. A lot. You take him out. All right. So, OG is then gonna kick the door open and charge in.

39:09

I was gonna cast a spell to. All right. Well, everyone will get a surprise round. You need to roll an ish first. Oh yes you will do sprouts around initiative awesome this. Maybe everyone's like easier. The more we, we fight these ninjas and see their daily life and stuff.

39:34

The The more Grayson doesn't believe any of no ways boasting about how amazing they are and how she could kill us in our sleeper with a thought or any of that, he's just like. Ah, this is pathetic. God. I know these are not great. Ninjas. You know horrible the ninjas they really are.

39:54

They were not made optimally at all. These are. Yeah. These are fucking foot clan, tier ninjas. Let's yes, that is exactly what they are Season. 1 Ninja Turtles foot foot clan. I was thinking like, stormtroopers that's what this is. This is the gets doing things. This is the team is really done.

40:20

Ochi didn't roll? Yeah, I did. I was the first one Did. I don't see you on there. I I hit the dang button. There you are. This is the TMNT Ratatouille crossover, but boom, everyone can have blessed.

40:53

And how long is heroism? Do I still have it? Yeah, there's last forever. It's like an at, like 10 minutes for like, but Theo, you're surprise around mover standard. It can be standard.

41:13

Yes.

41:19

I'm gonna have, I'm gonna have to five foot step. Sadly.

41:31

Now, I can cast it for more I'm at, and I don't have to worry about hitting a Ochi.

41:47

Damn. That damn suck ass. That is where it originates from your square. Okay, I didn't I guess I would have to 5 foot step. Then I don't think I just throw it. I mean, I probably logic.

42:07

Is there? No reflex. Save. No three reflexive. Oh! Reflex have gotcha.

42:18

He shake a five-foot step in a surprise room and actually can only do a move or standard and Surprise around. Yeah, I think it's called out specifically. As you can only do this or this. By the way, the DC is actually one higher is actually DC 18. Why are you trying to make your party members life harder I might trying to?

42:42

Hey, how would you? Now I need the ninjas. All three of many way. No, all four of them.

42:57

No, that does miss this one. Oh and why is it show it on the on the thing because where you originally dropped it? It hit all of them. Okay, All right. So as you can also take free actions during the surprise round.

43:22

Don't take a five of a step is a free action.

43:32

It's fine. I can work with us and technically called out as no action.

43:48

Or done.

43:52

This is important information to know.

44:28

Okay, yep. You can take a pipe with step in any round when you don't perform any other kind of movement. So that includes a surprise room. Okay, so I can I guess I would move there. Yep, and then we'll move this here and then you hit all of them.

44:47

Oops.

44:50

The boom DC-18. I'm gonna have to fix that. Say about, wow.

45:03

Not a single one of them.

45:09

45:29

And choco.

45:47

Better. I got rid of it, and thank you.

45:56

I'm just,

46:01

Trying to get a look at what's I can't. I can't get in to see what's happening in there. Ah Yeah I have no idea. We're not even engines, are I don't have, but I position here.

46:20

He moved. Where how garbage? You'll see what where they're at. Yeah, those two are technically flying in the air. So you can move to that spot of like, okay.

46:46

And so you did a movement.

46:54

You have any for yourself actions. You'd like to do. Can I start a performance as a swift yet? Let me check. Uh, you know, like 7:30 seventh, seventh level never mind, right? Yeah, that's my turn. All right, that is good. Do nothing. Okay. Then Consuming arrow and sure. Yep, racing test arrow.

47:28

And that's it for and kills the first ninja. Ochi. Oh, gee is going to zoom up in between all of them and pull out his weapons.

47:46

Try and draw some fires. You guys can just pick them off. Like you do That will be his turn.

48:08

Way young, I put steps.

48:32

On that close enough.

48:42

And boom. Yeah, no I said not close enough.

48:53

He died. He doesn't get a turn.

49:16

Okay, singular deck.

49:21

Video. You will probably walk forward playing out his mace, I proceed to beat it with a beat the ninja in front of them.

49:37

All right, go say felt, you know,

49:51

Which isn't I even hit? Yeah, yeah, you did.

50:01

And here.

50:39

And then, that's why.

50:48

And the templates not set up you.

50:57

Okay. One pixel, What only takes half.

51:10

Choco.

51:14

Just turn that down. Oh,

51:39

Ashoka will just take out his sword and

51:47

Run on in.

51:57

They'll say sorry about this person and as he gets 10 feet in he will close the door behind him.

52:20

I'll switch back to YouTube and take a swing at this guy.

52:39

That here and staggers him. Why did we close the door? Because that was hopefully make if they're about to scream because they probably going to society of church like racing alarm like you know make it quieter That's not unfair. Belong. Be dead.

53:26

Nice to attack you with butcher knife. He's holding.

53:35

And misses that does not hit. And he takes one damage because he was staggered. Yeah. Oh yeah. He drops.

54:00

But an Abby. Sorry, I'm wet. Hey, We just left you in there at the wasps. That's something bad. That's just. Why would you do that to me? Why would you just leave me in here with a bunch of worked in first station? Corpses actually know. It was just the one, you just so good at being vicious, killer, we thought it was best to leave you to watch them.

54:31

I hate you.

54:38

Yeah. Sorry, I would, I would have been here earlier, but bluntly put today has been very fucky. And what did I miss? See you guys were clearly. He went down. Went up the stairs in the room with the wasps instead of going left to any of the doors. And we found not even the way back up but we did find off of.

55:03

We went up that way and we didn't find anything really but we came back down and off of the same room with the wasps in a little closet off of the hallway. We found one of the board members from the Rheim Runner's, Guild that the frozen shadows had taken for trying to vote against silver scores, Which is with the guild.

55:22

And they've been like testing poisons on them and stuff. He seems chill. And it's motive Tim. And we took him to hang out with Oakshaka and watch her back while we continue on to look for a mako.

55:36

Tree, I think. And then we came down this hallway and found Ratatouille ETMNT crossover. Thumb cooks, they found frozen shadow cuts. Very good at proceedious, really? Yeah. They rolled four perception checks, and none of them got above, like a 15. No one got 19 but wouldn't hide them and he's one of them's getting away right now.

56:20

Mmm, I think up. Thank you.

56:30

So what you're telling me is that he didn't get away Got not yet. Well technically no he he's trying to get away but grace has got a door. He's got open. He left it open when he went behind him. When he went out, We also did talk about the wasps and we were like, these are bad.

56:49

Juju, just leave them in there and then we walked away it. You enjoyed sent us free. Nope, we don't share language with them. We do not. No one said you only one that actually probably wouldn't offend them would be zeal.

57:10

Oh, great thing. You not doing anything. He moved 10 foot and then opened a door. It's door got slammed in his face. He was gonna be like, oh, there's another door over here. I'll go open it. Who close the door behind them, you know? Okay. Yeah, well if that's the case then.

57:42

Oh, she's gonna do that.

57:47

And I will roll to avoid if I need to, you will need to. But remember the Acrobatic thing cuts your movement in half. That's true. So what am I at right now? Actually, maybe 25. I think yeah, it's a you were here. So Yeah, I wouldn't be able to do that.

58:16

Basically, You could get right up to him. That defeats the purpose of what I want to do. I'll just take the attack of opportunity. If any that is fair he swings his butcher. I bet you. No we're kidding. Right? Gosh, dang it. He didn't I don't and there's no way in 8 conference like trade but he hit you with his butcher knives.

58:43

Yeah, he did. So I'll take that and then in retaliation, I'm going to balk him. I'm gonna do a bonk.

58:58

I forgot to target him. It's okay, open.

59:13

Anything else on your turn? I think that's it.

59:25

The door slowly creeks open with a monkey hanging from the handle.

59:57

I'm sorry.

01:00:05

You trying to knock him out? Why is that non-lethal look like button is why?

01:00:20

Let's do. We're thinking.

01:00:25

Well done. Well done. That's kind of like a click call. You was trying to target herself. She hates stabbing people in the back, but these are bad people. What does it look like out here in this cool outdoor area? Yeah. Yeah, The hidden Dell, a pitched purest. Delle squeezes between the steeply sloping flanks of the nearby crabs that rise a hundred feet or more of overhead narrow waterfall rushes.

01:00:58

The notorian down one of these slopes and collects and they catch pawn next to a batch roof lean-to with two large fieldstone chimneys, which is the kitchen a small torrent exist in this pond wending. Its way towards the Great Hall where it disappears into a metal great in the halls foundation apart from the lean to leads over a narrow.

01:01:20

Bridge of rough sawn logs, arching over the stream and further down the defile until it is lost among the rocky outcroppings beyond Interdasking.

01:01:39

Grayson's gonna go search, the room that he's in, because even though we killed the people in it earlier, we didn't actually search it. I don't think no, you did not see seven.

01:01:53

It doesn't bunk sand haphazardously about this room soon with rumpled bedding assorted clothing and personal items. And the discarded remains of food and empty plates. You have the north door. Sit, two stain foul smelling buckets that are apparently not empty frequently enough.

01:02:18

Think we found bathroom? All right, so take it. No, loot in this room. Then I'm scrolling down. I mean, if you really want to go digging for it, we can go get the strainer. Nope, there is stuff there. It's scattered things.

01:03:10

Course.

01:03:15

You see another times, four of the

01:03:32

Noise.

01:03:48

Real shame. You killed all the ninjas on this level because now the party is super split up.

01:04:06

I like to thank you luck. Noah, and a room full of various little chemical stuff. And she's basically just being helping herself for the last few minutes while you guys were murdering stuff in the background. That's it's in discord. What's in that room. Okay, so you can lug all that stuff back and get money for it, but there wasn't actually a lot of out chemical stuff.

01:04:28

A lot of poison stuff which is all chemicals. These are the same word I've seen no difference between these pictures did Anyways. It's all bottle up in this one room. The Grayson went into here. Come on, friends.

01:04:59

Ah,

01:05:07

Oh god. Okay, Stack, the floor is not.

01:05:16

My marks are the door. We went through. Ah, yeah. So that way. Oh now Ah, no way the Lord. So Hmm, looks down. I am. Um, It's fine. He'll put one of those questions here. They don't think of it to you. Oh, you want me to click any sandwich?

01:05:52

You heal.

01:05:56

Certainly, it's not like you picked up a random bottle of poison and decided to view me. You might have picked up a random model of poison and decided to feed it to me. It's fine OG open system with his bird foot. Anything is possible. Movable boom. We are doing the dungeon in Reverse, by the way.

01:06:17

I'm not sure how I feel about this. Numerous wooden bed frames. Look real mattresses occupy. This sparsely furnished room. It does not appear that. Anyone has used this room recently, but it could quarter as many as a dozen.

01:06:35

And he's gonna go up here and check the closet because we found a bunch of stuff in the other one. Nope, this room is empty. Dang. All right, folks, Do we want to go back to where we found? Are board member friend, and try and go back up those stairs up, the tower.

01:06:58

Or should we try and go down the stairs off of the long haul. Let's go up to the second story of the long haul, okay? But I said what that what we said. Let's do it. I mean I think I like going up if I was a ninja overlord that's where I'd be.

01:07:29

What other Natalie? What. Yeah, what's the point of having a big castle? If you don't really enjoy the view to make people think that you would be in the big funny tower when you'd actually stick a wizard in there.

01:07:49

Well, Let's flip that coin.

01:08:05

That's all about us. Don't eat second story.

01:08:20

My Philippine is probably more by the point, hasn't it? When did you get? I think, what during the fight with the The first six ninjas. Oh, no was a monk, sorry.

01:08:43

Yeah, it's still definitely been more than like five minutes. Okay, so I'll go ahead and debut the but debuff myself from that one.

01:08:54

So we check these oh yeah. Upper closets. Here's the trapdoor, by the way.

01:09:04

That's a little.

01:09:20

Oh, she's gonna try the handle on this one. It is locked.

01:09:31

And one of the other side. So over here is the height table and these are a bunch of other eating tables.

01:09:47

This is the trapdoor that leads directly to the hall beneath.

01:09:57

No. Wait, you just did you go past the high table over here?

01:10:04

Yeah, you would probably assume this as much because chart, but let's see some scald words, roughly carved into the table. With dagger point Time is the coin of fools rendered due onto the gods.

01:10:29

Beams carved in stable, where snoring stone? I would have said. Hmm. Oh cool. We've got mad Rambling in here, too. Fantastic. What was that again? Time is the And Time is the coin of fools rendered due unto the gods.

01:10:59

Was words Grayson since no ways on the other side. You're pretty good at these sorts of lock things, right? Could you take a look at this? No, I seem to have completely forgotten how to do it since snowy showed up, Okay?

01:11:22

Very honest, Grayson

01:11:30

Before we do anything shook us, gonna recast like magic because he's got a funny feeling. Do I get anything? Nope. No magic. Mmm. Well, the way because we can just talk across the hall. Is that one locked on the other side?

01:11:54

Hands. It.

01:12:03

To which oh three fingers myself with this garbage. Uh the 29. Get that Joshua Lope. It does indeed.

01:12:22

More importantly Grayson, you can pick locks

01:12:29

It used to be able to and then you showed up and I seem to have forgot you cut a rogue in the party thing. You points? Yeah, well, you get that also let me switch out the the trait that I'd use to get disabled device as a classical. So now I feel bad.

01:12:55

You just yellow over to me, what you find in there because I can't do. Whatever. Grayson just did Now, just watched it across. I moved the tiles. I'm getting a collides with wall and I were moving into the bowl.

01:13:26

Remind me if I ever need to, like, find all of you, all I need to do is start picking locks, apparently, it's sum until like the death

01:13:35

The bone. Yeah, it was a DC. 20 disabled device. Oh by the way, having to either tough, by two, okay?

01:13:51

I don't know what in my, but it

01:13:57

It's Now I've got six more of those but he'll define. I don't intend to get whacked, so they don't actually give a description of this room. They just call it the cloakroom. This room holds cloaks and cold weather clothing to outfit the occupants of the hall through the long winters in addition valuable furs and males of raw wood appeared from the old super super here.

01:14:29

Unique rifle through pockets, nobody happens to have anything in the might suggest wearing us, except things, you know, things being people that are vaguely important. Give me a perception. Check for those. Searching the room. Okay. Yeah. And why not? I'll give you.

01:15:01

For everyone that got over a 17 you discover several roles of leather covered in tiny cramps scalded runes stuffed into one chest appear to be the personal diaries of snoring, stone, eye and relates. Not only his vile past but also details of his apocalyptic revelation.

01:15:28

Apocalyptic. You say, Indeed Anyone that can read scald make me a linguistics check? Oh, come on. I got you.

01:15:49

I was about to say I feel like just looks at the bird poaching will clear his throat and read it out to everybody. Deal in my thunder.

01:16:07

You find in the rantings. Something we're referring to a concealed cash in the upstairs, flu. I didn't away for the coming winter.

01:16:23

Also, in that room is all displayed old snorty. Had a little holiday stash. I thought that sunk with him. Sudden apparently he did very well first until we go and find that stash doing a murder and stuff. There's a reason he was called the Mad River. Where would that flu be?

01:16:53

I think you're kind of just hand waving that. But where would that at the end of the haul? It says in the upstairs flu. I don't even know what a flu is. It's a fireplace thing.

01:17:10

It's what the actual tube that takes this smoke up is called.

01:17:19

And y'all go in the long way round.

01:17:24

I just wanted to see if the flu was on the nava. If someone could move me would be greatly appreciated. I can't quite be my computer right now, you

01:17:40

Say the stores locked. Good. It is 29. It's open wooden pegs on the walls of this chamber holds shields and scabbards wooden sands. Hold chainmail, hobler, Hallbergs and open chest sold arrows, and axes, a number of spheres have also been stacked together in one corner. This room is Raven crabs Armory and there is magic in here.

01:18:11

Oh, there is a single magical arrow in the 225 arrows. In the chest. Oh, Starcraft Fold story, really didn't spare any expense? Yes, smell crap. Please.

01:18:37

And the bum. Do they single greater magical beast? Slang arrow. No. I spend that around and hand it over to Greyson.

01:18:58

He says Mary Christler.

01:19:04

Well, I think we found everything. We're going to find up here. All right? So, the greater arrow of slang.

01:19:15

Come on updates. But the bomb This plus one arrows key to a particular type of creature. In this case a nope that is the unless here we go a greater sling arrow functions. Just like a normal slang arrow but the DC to avoid the death effect is 23 in the arrow deals.

01:19:37

A hundred points of damage. If the saving throw is failed.

01:19:44

I am.

01:19:48

You said the DC was what? It's a VC23. I think there are the sling arrows, are in the items to convenients.

01:20:03

Get trails lane. I will drop that on heat. That's neat. Oh, thank you.

01:20:19

And it is for magical piece.

01:20:27

And yes DC23 or a hundred points of damage. Oops. It never unlocked the door for you. It's all right. So long as a giant, spider thing doesn't creep out of it and try and eat me. Oh, that's absolutely going to happen. This is farm waiting for it.

01:20:50

But she just hear himself. Yeah, I'm just hoping the princess and decided to get herself into a bit of bother. I'll just be always there. A staggered low bat on the map.

01:21:06

And because I felt like it. Okay above. I didn't know, like it.

01:21:15

Oh we'll see too much fat. Would you preferred less fat as opposed to know that Just regular bat would have been acceptable? The boom and then with a screeching screaming sound. Oh, it's here. Several raven swarms drop from the openings in the ceiling.

01:21:48

Um over under on how effective sleep is on swarms.

01:21:56

Like I don't know how that that works. I don't that much.

01:22:04

How do they was that calculator? I gotta get back to my food. Now. It's just dependent upon the BC's of the creatures. And then SH. Yeah. They had died because they're not like it is a swarm of creatures that quantify this many had died and they are I assume but the plate but I don't know.

01:22:39

Oh Well, I guess I'll just see what happens with my cast it.

01:22:50

I just don't know if like it would like say, oh, one Raven is like one quarter of a hit die. No. The swarms have a singular hit dice, okay? Because when they destroyed, they break up and disperse. Now, I initiative. Whatever. I don't want to fight the giant rear and swarms but they have eyeballs for you.

01:23:22

It didn't ask for them, you know.

01:23:30

You are still really damaged.

01:23:42

Are you on the measure tool? Essentially, there's a wall.

01:23:51

Boom, move into this square out from where there you go. And now move. That's three of my movement. And this is a big opening open area, right? Because it goes down into the Great Hall below.

01:24:13

A higher part of these things, they are coming in through the ceiling. So see about eighty feet high. We have fly speed of 40. So there's still about 40 feet up from the ground So I can't wait hit him with an AoE just yet. I can't remember. Can I be tablet?

01:24:37

Our date targeted. No. Okay. I guess I'm going to ready ready in action when they get caught within range then like I guess,

01:24:57

Here. I forget one of that more than that range. I will cast a spell. It'll be a furious small. Stumbles, okay. Hello.

01:25:40

Well, that sucks for that swarm. What's that? They drop into the bonfires directly beneath them. They also take fall damage.

01:26:01

36, but let me

01:26:09

How far they drop it was. That question. 40 feet. That's that's pretty. So they're open the ceiling right now. They drop. Yeah, with 43 to get to water our level is and then they're got an additional however many people to drop further.

01:26:30

No, they're still 40 feet from the ground. Okay. Hopeless is not it's called I mean it's still pretty tall. 40 feet like and then conference and they are catching on fire.

01:26:57

All right. How does following damage work with us? Componentate each tape. Stop thinking about them. As individual creatures, I know It was a creature.

01:27:16

Understand it, go.

01:27:35

That's hatching on fire. Okay, we will just go with besides, for boiling water damage. I guess they have that but not a bonfires more often immerse. There's something that I bought for playing damage. He exposure.

01:28:02

Don't actually see a bonfire on here anywhere though.

01:28:13

I mean author, just separate rules for catching on fire. There are. But then they'd only take one new 6 points of damage being immersed in the boiling. Water. Does Henry stick points damage for a round of exposure? And I mean, bonfires get really fucking hot. They seem like basically at least be comfortable to that set up 1v6.

01:28:42

Yeah, you want you can you can also anywhere you want. The reason why they only do one V6 is because abstractly speaking, you can like survive running through it on my You can but dropping directly into it for an entire roundness. It's different.

01:29:04

I don't disagree. So I'm gonna roll it as full immersion, just like boiling water since they're literally dropping directly onto it. Yeah. I feel It would be really silly if like straying someone up and like setting them on fire like a witch. Only did 1D specs damage time. Ridiculous.

01:29:36

Of.

01:29:42

That's warm is gone. But now I'm just saying that I have made this house, really. It applies to players too. But don't fall into a bonfire unconscious.

01:30:00

Favorite sports.

01:30:11

They have to double move, but they're coming. No, she did.

01:30:26

What?

01:30:35

Yeah, I think that's just you and choir right now Shoko. Yeah, and then their irate.

01:30:50

Lose what you see important in reflex. Save.

01:31:05

Oh yeah.

01:31:20

All right. Play will technically be blind for one day.

01:31:31

Bones just over here.

01:31:44

Wow.

01:31:55

Making it. Okay. Turn now,

01:32:05

Oh, gee says, brothers brothers. There's no need for this. Just kidding. They're too far away from me to really do anything. I will run all the way up into do some stab on this other one. Perhaps.

01:32:24

You may be needed. Am I interesting? Organ called away with baby? No, I see him doing stuff.

01:32:47

You can charge into this square if you want.

01:32:56

He went way in, as little,

01:33:08

Here. Now anywhere. Yeah, just discord things With a charge. I can move double speed and attack still, that is correct. Oh then I'll take a swing and they are tiny. So that if you have damage from attacks but you can attack them, I remember they're fun.

01:33:35

That hits.

01:33:39

All right, that's all I got you.

01:33:53

Theocast. That's good.

01:34:06

Here.

01:34:25

They fail and a bunch of frozen birds fall from the sky.

01:34:42

I'm sorry. Anything else nature? No. That I over the main concern. It's better already action, you know?

01:34:59

Find your bread.

01:35:06

Babies Ravens. Cannot make reflex saves save their lives.

01:35:12

Now, I did you get the healing from that channel. That was a channel. Yeah, clear. Just channeled. Oh so she did. Thank you. Apologies. Cool. But we're gonna roundhouse throw hands.

01:35:40

Not should be the first attack.

01:35:56

Pull down, because it was bloomberg that on. This is.

01:36:02

Right, they're funny.

01:36:13

And see that. These are just one. Of course, that's just that's just rude supposed to action key point. I ate her ones people. Wow, I'll just take these. Let's go to make up for all the creating we did on Thursday it really is no I would be doing all the credit on Thursday.

01:36:34

You knows very out of character. Great incredibly. So actually make all the one occasionally feed actually like massive, but yeah, no, that's that's my entire time. I will definitely.

01:36:53

And controvert.

01:37:21

Protection, heat can go over here.

01:37:27

Backgrounds.

01:37:32

And no directions where he doesn't hit someone actually.

01:38:04

That's his turn. Grayson.

01:38:11

Here's a little, pull out some blunt arrows, and we'll shoot at the swarm.

01:38:25

You. That's okay. You only need to done first one.

01:38:35

See, you don't need to be scared of all swarms. You guys can handle the ratings forms, just fine.

01:38:47

Press X to down.

01:38:54

I'm suppose anyone's all red-bellied one among these.

01:39:02

You know, production, but no because he didn't. No, I didn't say anything.

01:39:19

Oh, close the cases. Now going to be smelling up, roasted bird for at least the next little while, but still no closer to finding what we're actually here for, I take it. Oh, and a frozenberg Township. Oh, I'm dessert. Wonderful.

01:39:40

Raven obstacles.

01:39:47

In front of where

01:39:57

So you guys have searched the entirely now of the first floor and second floor of the long novel. So the only places left are open to that tower or back down to the dungeon.

01:40:20

I think we're not towards the power for me to find that.

01:40:32

And if I don't know, here might as well Since we don't know whether she is up or down, triple up.

01:41:00

The up and down stairs on this weren't working in a minute ago. Ah crap. And so we're heading for the tower, right? I'm just gonna gather everyone up. Yeah, they are. Instead of making a wonder through, which while amusing is also time to consuming.

01:41:30

You're gonna take all the amusement you can get it. I really do, There are some days where I want to just shake players and like let me have fun too. Real loud Tap. The front, the power This way, is the direction that does not

01:42:03

Oh great. That's lovely.

01:42:09

Let me get to move all of us back onto this. Oh, you did. Thank you. I don't know why that particular teleporter shoots everyone right into that wall. I appear to accept the time space continuum, there was one important thing that I left out before you got back here.

01:42:29

Abby, How did you get there? You don't have this latest clue but I decided to take a peek into the cliffside.

01:42:47

So something I missed you said.

01:42:53

Yeah, when you get up here, I could show you. If you move to where like, Koya is on the stairs, Oh, what is that? A local day. This room off behind the staircase, is Jordan, the axis bedroom, where we left him alone to drink in his sorrows because he's level good and being forced to do.

01:43:15

Bad boy, bad bear things until we passed on finding

01:43:26

And we're sure that he's being forced. That was about to say, no I just kind of like shakes her head in his late is under a black heels. Is Though I didn't put it on the artwork because it's not my original artwork and I totally forgot. He does have a big red, bloody mark on his chest.

01:43:49

So we're going up these stairs. It's another people have blood gears as usually because they willfully got them.

01:44:00

How do you remove one of those? By the way that something we could remove from it. Well, then my case apparently you put it yourself into contact with an incredibly powerful artifact and it blats it off. But I get the suspicion that wouldn't work for him and more importantly you certain that he's so goodly intended.

01:44:27

I'm sure he's my backup character.

01:44:33

That's a joke.

01:44:40

All right, you Didian, we did say, he said wear bears are laval good. I don't know if that's always or most of the time or a lot. Oh, but no, that's that's just they are traditionally and inclined to be. That means absolutely nothing for As a mouse can be evil.

01:45:01

It's true. Well, he seems sad so I didn't want to hurt him. He did, he was drowning in wine. It looked like I just sounds like something man, if you want to fight it you can go fight him. I'll stand right here and watch.

01:45:24

She now that you've laid some eggs and had them hatch, you've become very soft on us. I think you and I both know, I've been very soft the entire time. Yep, you're right. Oh excellent. Remember that one time? I spared some goblins. Oh boy, what just happened? He's just, Why would you do that?

01:45:48

That was what I say. All right, your backseat drivers. Get up here and die with me.

01:45:58

Above. There's about to be a lot of bird on bird violence right here. There's a super bird on bird violence going. Okay, I'm sorry. No, you you don't need to worry. They were waiting for someone to step up on the stairs before. This is against flat-footed as they popped out of invisibility, dang.

01:46:27

We've been thinking sneak attack. Hold on one second.

01:46:40

I don't think I have it yet. If you're looking for uncanny, you don't have it. Yeah, well I can take it from the flourishes for warrior poet too and I don't look, it doesn't look like I have. So yeah, that gets me. Yeah, you. Yeah. And it's back which is sick.

01:46:58

It is quick. So I took a stab and I took another stab, what you got too fast, but they're not get sneak attacks off on me. Oh, they do. Oh boy, I set up sneak attacks separately.

01:47:17

OG just goes of 23 points of damage outs.

01:47:29

And then the next encounter will be good.

01:47:38

Oh boy.

01:47:45

Okay, koias right here.

01:47:57

They won't hit me again. That's for sure. Hear the question isn't quite kind of you know plane. All right. That's actually a good point. Probably not actually because having read read the iRake it can be gotten rid of with these E15 heel check. Which you probably have done Shaka?

01:48:26

Yeah, Yeah. Probably Though, we'll say she did and Chaka is still guarding. That merchants Also the stairs, you

01:48:45

And we're going to take a quick 10. People to grab drinks and use the restroom KK. Oh,

02:00:27

And, And since the stage of quitting smoking where I'm hacking stuff up. Oh, school. Dear. No, it's it's a good stage. Just an awful stage of the same time.

02:00:48

We're not even. If everyone here.

02:00:58

Sound off.

02:01:03

Do we have magnets because these look like he's moved. Yeah, yeah. I was called away partway for what we were doing earlier. And so yeah, I got sprinkled down here. Where are we? I will put you up here.

02:01:24

They are up these stairs in the tower.

02:01:30

If you would join us in initiative, please?

02:02:10

Pleasurable. Hey Theo.

02:02:20

I can't move. Look inside. It's imposed, though.

02:02:29

And come over there.

02:02:33

Artist that guy. But this.

02:02:43

That breaks through his blur effect.

02:02:49

And that's the end of my turn. Oh, it's turning in. I guess he will pull it back. He will want. Now, he will pull attack.

02:03:14

It's too.

02:03:21

Yeah, they go, they one of those fitsy. Right first. Oh, well, no. Yeah, he hits me away. He want the 20, net 20. What would hit the internet 20? Yeah, it wasn't that 20. Oh, it isn't that 20, but it wouldn't confirm. Talk about the Tango's attackers Zeo's attack.

02:03:46

This is the tank attack. Is it walk is Ashi attack will hit his bite. Attack will hit the crit, will not hit. Okay. And then here to snack attacks, I'm sorry, is the flanking included in the bite? Actually the confirmation because then he would the 16 hits. You got my flat-footed, I still have an acted.

02:04:14

Oh shit.

02:04:18

Well, at least the critical damage is only three points more. You got your backup character, already, and all your? Yeah, this gonna put me really low dude. So if I apply time, they did something apply. Alright, I don't mean that the expense of your character but he's ninjas have been pretty worthless.

02:04:48

I'm at negative three. I'm down. So, that was him.

02:05:01

You, you

02:05:19

Try it.

02:05:26

And,

02:05:37

Okay. Yeah, and OG's just gonna go down, he's not gonna use resolve. No. No. I don't think that's a very good idea way in reappears and stabs one of the Tengu in the thigh.

02:06:16

And have double moves there.

02:06:26

Well yeah.

02:06:35

Important to come backcast. For that, but she's targeting here. So again.

02:06:52

Really quiet.

02:06:58

He fails the cast defensively, but refusing to let her little birdie go. Oh, she can't pass the move action because she had to move.

02:07:24

Grayson. Okay, it's gonna start moving.

02:07:42

Well it's great to know what the fucking already and we'll do us the service of that 50. That's one move and then we'll start a just double moving.

02:08:02

The handy 80 and he'll just run right up next to the guy and that's his turn.

02:08:28

You hear screeching, Raven's voice beginning to cast the spell and just get

02:08:42

Lemon Nature's Allied 3. And with the 35, I will tell you he is summoning air element rules.

02:08:52

Oh, goody

02:09:04

Bringing us to Shoko.

02:09:11

Where is it one? Nope, not that way. Up these stairs.

02:09:39

Okay, circle and shove his way past Zeo.

02:09:55

Where is the bird? You have no idea.

02:10:06

But you can hear him.

02:10:13

This flock of Ravens, are they about to come together and open window? They're outside though. Yeah, they're playing around the tower. Okay asleep.

02:10:47

Default to their doom. That's so lucky. They were also flying over a bonfire. No, they're just flying 80 feet in here. I'm still gonna roll the damage and see, but it is more than likely that they're dead. The storm only has 18 HP. They're dead and I'll be shot.

02:11:12

Goes turn and falling is clutching damage. Oh, dear form.

02:11:33

Plus it's busy little bit.

02:11:45

I'm sure you wonderful people have some sort of plan. I'm sure you do. My plan is to stop bleeding. I recommend it. Uncheck, if you believe.

02:12:04

And fortunately that is one short but you do not stabilize this room. Okay, what happens. Never died before. Minus one more HP, negative 4.

02:12:41

Why is it doing that? I don't know doing what he's committed. Negative 11, it's I tried to just change it to four and it took it as subtract 4 from my total twice. So yeah, I think. Yeah. Oh, she's dead. I died. I've lost vision. I'm really dead.

02:13:12

Okay, want to do?

02:13:23

Oh, I accidentally deleted you. It looks like he. Alright go ahead and throw Jordan in this room. That's my new character.

02:13:39

You information tracker.

02:13:47

Okay, the exact same role you got before, huh? There's two of me in there now thing. Yeah, they're two of them in there. Oh disappeared, but that's fine. Yeah, I deleted the old one, the boom like videos.

02:14:14

You. The only thing stopping them from swarming. You is the tango in the way.

02:14:35

Their place, we just intense.

02:14:52

Video.

02:14:58

I can move over there, right?

02:15:03

Uh, yeah. That's one.

02:15:09

Well, I'm not I'm I'm to go ahead and, you know, use this on the same, the same thing. You grab it with trying to beat up on one missiles. Hit kick them down the other one with left or the other one.

02:15:31

He is still up.

02:15:37

Oh, that's the end of my turn.

02:15:42

Now, it is his turn and he is a monkey, stabbing him in the crotch and the grace, the next one. Not sure which is more terrifying. The legs are right there, man. It's true. He will swing at the door and I believe Miss. Correct.

02:16:09

And,

02:16:14

You bite.

02:16:20

Look.

02:16:32

Though, this monkey starts scrambling all over him blaming and biting.

02:16:45

I'm gonna say when he technically gets detected. No, is signing in doesn't provide you and is not invisible. That Raven. Swarm is dead.

02:17:07

Quiz going to step into the square over him so she doesn't have to roll shit.

02:17:19

21 points. Hell yeah.

02:17:29

Phone. She moved great sand.

02:17:35

A concentrime perception. The fact that pinpoint the like the location of the the changes or casting

02:18:00

It sounds like it's coming from the other side of the tower.

02:18:15

All right, I might regret this Grace is gonna try to like run over there. Obviously not a run maneuver, but

02:18:32

I'm sure there's a text opportunity. So There are from two tengo.

02:18:44

But let me quick.

02:18:54

So, the first one gets a 16 hit Artemis. The second one is against your flat-footed AC with the 15. Also a mess. Very nice over them. Give me now resume.

02:19:18

And he's gonna take a Was it called perfect strike. Shot. The one where he rolls twice and uses the better attack. Sure Are we sure words doesn't have deflect arrows. So it'll be the 29 to hit. He's trying to attempting to interrupt the spellcast,

02:20:00

Not key roles this.

02:20:08

Don't roll the twice. The 13. You interrupt. His spellcasting Everybody. In this term Grayson will like narrows his eyes. He feels like he's got unfinished business from when he tried to take the bird down back at the temple. Yeah, definitely man. Everyone's got even with this bird.

02:20:38

Boom.

02:20:44

The bird narrows his eyes at you.

02:20:51

Pause out. Something else in druidic.

02:21:01

It's not.

02:21:06

And a wall torrent of wind appears between the two of you.

02:21:30

This is therapy, all right. Boom. The Tango like panic swings at the flying gold helm Mrs. Choko.

02:21:54

To find know.

02:22:02

Swarms are very annoying. So,

02:22:09

What? I'm like that. So that just in case somehow, the swarm in the Tango are both to HD. They are both for HD actually. So which one would you like to target of it would be the swarm because the storm is closer to the epicenter. Little boom. But at the past outs form,

02:22:38

Some very effective uses of sleep today. Yes. Incredibly Anyway, and this is a very useful spot But 20 20. Hmm.

02:23:02

Yeah. Okay.

02:23:06

Um,

02:23:15

Schwing.

02:23:23

The nope. Nope, nope. Nope.

02:23:33

That deeply into the tengo who squats that, you much the same way that It oats you squawks.

02:23:46

It's the death car. People are probably going to hate me for saying this, but I note that they probably have blurup. Oh yeah, they do. Hope they're up. These are the competent Ninjas. I forgot the boom. You still had like the blurred vanishes for a moment. I'm just put this right here.

02:24:14

Oh look. And then just kind of looks urgent. Just like what are you? Come on. Very tired. Is it? No way. Adjust her glasses. Slightly in the blurriness goes away. This would experiment. That's pretty thematic edge. Ochi is going to stand up. Probably get stabbed. We'll see you were club-footed before.

02:24:46

Yeah. Does me now standing count as acting? They all look up everything, so that'll be a miss then actually he doesn't have combat reflexes. I'm helping You are helping I guess that's just what I would buy on ninjas who were trying to help points in area. I know, right?

02:25:14

These are terrible or Carol, ninjas. They're terrible news. I stand and swing on that boy. You hit him that boy and that's pretty much going to be the turn for me. Unfortunately. But look at how sweet their faces are. Why would you ever want to hurt them?

02:25:51

Look at those spaces. Why does that one look cuddlier than mine? I don't like how they've drawn the floof here. It looks more like he's diseased.

02:26:06

I'm in their feathers. He's part sheep. I know he's bird sheep just tell that they're supposed to be bushy feathers but it looks more like just corpse skin to me and anything else on your turn out. She. No, that's all I got really or even swarm continues to use.

02:26:45

Lines over and tried to head button but it is not it.

02:26:56

Deal.

02:27:05

Forget that guy. And hit it with the snowball, right? No, no. I got a blur effect going. I roll for my cool blur. By the way. Oh yeah.

02:27:28

I mean, I liked it better when you hit

02:27:38

Will leave the head. The snowball collides with him academic muscle, the magic missile collides with him. But here in my turn. Angry ninja is unconscious way and takes full round action, and slits his throat.

02:28:08

I don't think she was a little monkey. Just gets done. We've done a switchblade.

02:28:18

The monk is growing on me.

02:28:31

Who loves fortitude and still does in succeed, that was really good role.

02:28:45

On the hey, fucking birds. Not you OG, rude.

02:29:11

There's nothing to huggle his beak. Bounces off of the tiny Cassian, angel.

02:29:19

Who has DR10 or 5 cold, iron or evil. She. Oh yeah. But with a boom, boom.

02:29:37

They're 26 back to OG.

02:29:42

Yay. Amy both as an activist. I think anymore. Is it? No, no, it's not.

02:29:56

And then she's down in a couple.

02:30:06

And exclude, the two tango.

02:30:14

But Jesus, it's 19, never mind. She excludes all the enemies.

02:30:27

Out the room. Jason.

02:30:39

What size category is this Raven? It's Tony.

02:30:50

Oh my gosh. Sure I'm gonna I'll try this. I maybe this is a big mistake. Chris is going to try to run right through the wind wall.

02:31:06

And then he's gonna try to grapple the Raven.

02:31:15

He doesn't have any improvers and so I think it gets into tech opportunity against him. Do you have it or not? Combat. You know I'm strike, right? Yeah, you could but I try to grapple and let them not fun. It's you. You the same thing. It's the same thing under old scrables up in the room whatever you want to call the same page.

02:31:39

So CMP check or his the fiber that is two Program.

02:31:51

Already. So, add two to whatever this is though. Like maybe sense. Evades you? And that's my turn and boom. He's going to, but I would step.

02:32:27

Connected back footstep. Nope. It's it's the movement speed that affects it, not their size.

02:32:50

You see if this ability is in the features, can bend him up.

02:33:04

It's the one. I hate loading and thanks forever.

02:33:40

In the end.

02:33:57

Raven cause and bless a multiple electricity at you.

02:34:06

Assume a screenshot touch attack. Yeah. 29 would hit my touches. Like, that's the best he got. Just look fucking channel domain. Domain power from working air clerics. Well, you did have like seven swarms of crows and ravens and shit. So By the way that damaged on, yeah, the damage is off because it's trying to calculate its cleric bubbles.

02:34:36

Lettuce, Druid levels.

02:34:40

Minecraft the wrong one.

02:34:49

Really.

02:34:54

Okay, we will put the damage. Four much better. Much better was a 50% improvement even or 100% improvement 100% improvements below. This tengo who is somehow still alive, it's actually advantages.

02:35:34

About boom.

02:35:45

And swing this and Mrs. Terribly. What a waste of advantage. Choco.

02:36:02

I mean, If it ain't broke.

02:36:15

I meant to just get the video. Do you know? Oh, all right. He's not sleeping, he took a double shot of espresso.

02:36:35

No way. Especially actually no. Can I go back to my turn because I do on my mood left and

02:36:50

Okay. It's not it's not letting me show me along you all there dies.

02:37:04

Hmm, I guess I can't move. I guess I'll be the end of my turn. Is where do you want to go? Oh I'll seeing like right here or so but yeah yeah, I don't know outside because it's

02:37:26

He has left this plane. Here you go.

02:37:33

Huh, I can't see through here. I don't wall there. Yes, it is Then I guess I'll keep going and 10:15.

02:37:52

Can I keep going?

02:38:09

Then I guess I'll get to here. And then drop my shield and my weapon at the wedding and enter, No way. What would I like to do?

02:38:28

Five foot. Hey buddy. Hi.

02:38:43

One.

02:38:49

Output workouts. Yep. Blur. Oh yeah.

02:38:58

You eat.

02:39:03

Other hand. You eat. What's the concealment chance on blur 20? 20%.

02:39:25

Did not want to get myrtillated. No. He but zero HVXE, you want to just hits him with the five point, exploding heart taking like you want to just

02:39:45

Okay, I'll give him a poke. You don't have to.

02:39:56

I'm sorry. Is he bleeding? Is he and see your plansing shaking there? No. Because that was he down? And will he starts to? He's just staggered right, Right? Yeah, but if it goes anything he'll follow that is also true. I don't think Ouchie's smart enough to like eyeball that.

02:40:18

I think he's still gonna take this swing out of

02:40:27

Get them bird boy. So we'll do our swing there.

02:40:34

It goes down and then we will do one of my Ochi sprints

02:40:45

Can I go there? Yeah. Like through that area. Those Ravens are unconscious just you know, lightly.

02:41:03

Collides with wall. But I want to end up, then I go there. Yeah.

02:41:11

He can swing up. If he got one, he will through this square.

02:41:22

Bring with the short. Oh, gummy yay. But it just did something in this campaign and that will be okay. They did drop. They did. Drop Ochi they did. But that was the best. They had performed this entire book and you all know it, they could have killed me. I could have been dead if they had chosen to kill me and if your friends had an all piled up, they would have slit your throat Just letting you know.

02:41:56

The bones elk wall. There was a lot of headbuts again. There was a lot of gods mercy in that two rounds.

02:42:06

Well, you can't take time to code across someone really. When someone's right next to you takes opportunity being what they are. Looks at several beats that allow you to do that. Hmm. Oh, did we think they're high enough? Level to have those. Yes, as an actor, I will move.

02:42:25

We still gotta you gotta roll the concealment for my swing on bird guy that I killed and

02:42:38

Are we higher low? And what is borderline do? I don't actually know what an exact 20 does. That's like count mess. It's a mess. So what you're doing it and run away and run away? Yes, 1920. So 15% miscounter that sorry. Okay, so that's what you get when he runs away and then he drops because he was at zero.

02:43:09

Hemorrhi. What? Because I say if I took the swing and missed, I still would have ran over here. Yeah, so this is exact opportunity swing, which is an action. Gotcha. Cool beans. So he's still drops. He may not be a negative 9 anymore but he's a negative one and it was so cool that to everybody else had looked like we tried to swing at each other but I hit him and he died side.

02:43:41

I think if these guys are he is still up. Yes. Like he's gonna tell everybody, but like the stat board is gonna show. That is no way is kill. Probably there. And my heart. No, it's a supportive here. She just kind of gives you a thumbs up in the background like, no, no.

02:44:01

You can take credit, less people talk about me that happier right way. Leaves. The body of the corpsea just slits, throat of just covered. It's ready to the next one. Material spray just a fully red monkey.

02:44:26

And then he leaps onto this one and starts. Stabbing it. Uh, yeah, there's actually exactly what it does but he misses with his steps. Basically a gremlin. And I've never seen that movie just like spinning out like hellfire and climbing all over people and stabbing them repeatedly. Like I say the monkeys growing on me, we will cook monkey have weapons for us.

02:44:52

Yes. Is he hitting with strength? Yeah, he said he was strength.

02:45:02

It's because of his rage. He can't contain it his best friend. Ochi almost died. So he's just really stabbing them. He really is Yes, but that still wouldn't hit. Yeah. Obviously, you know, I thank you for letting me know Now. He has a plus eight to hit with his beggar.

02:45:22

No.

02:45:28

And about God. He's surrounded know.

02:46:07

Us to players turn.

02:46:14

To come right here. Still can't see you greasing. And the boom.

02:46:30

Upon Koia is the most reliable. Healer ever. Grayson healing. Make it around the corner to the factory. Does not unfortunately Well, I made the birch still right? It sight of me. So, is he do flurry of blows plus key shot?

02:46:57

Person, kills the bug.

02:47:02

Grace would not have killed the bird. If it wasn't for that crit found that still. That's it. Actually confirmed it actually confirms because his AC is exactly 22.

02:47:22

Both bump. And worlds, the blood feather Raven falls from the sky for the last time because that also far exceeded his constellation of 12 here. So forward to like see where he falls to be like, oh we need to go like find that body just to be sure or something.

02:47:48

So like when he impacts on the ground, is he like burning toward love, Druid body? Or it was he actually a bird? He was actually an awakened Raven.

02:48:01

I thought about testing that and using a arrow of being against beasts that we had found while yes, it would have worked on him because he became a magical beast after the awakening spell. Okay. So, what is outside this window? Is it that like back Glade thing that we saw No, from this window?

02:48:30

You can see the roof, the long haul. And then the clips. Mmm. Does it look like there's any way for us to get there? Like, does he see a pathway or doors? Who wear So wherever the body is, I know, you'd have to go outside and climb around the edge, okay.

02:49:01

You could do that from the the dell though.

02:49:11

Oh actually. No wait. Hold on power is right there though. He is actually on top of the roof. Lung house, excuse me, my bed.

02:49:27

On that site, he would fall directly onto the roof of the longhouse Ravens on the other side. Fell down the cliff.

02:49:38

So he's only like 20 feet down, not a very tall tower.

02:49:48

Okay.

02:49:57

Worlds, does not get a chance to stabilize for me that negative 20,

02:50:07

Which is Making its choco stern.

02:50:23

All right, did we did we kill the Ravensworm? The one that you knock unconscious? Yeah, Nope. No one's texted who we should probably take care of that. How long you sleep last night? Here you just Okay. We could just leave it only go. I mean, people get out of the way I can take care of this to the swarm.

02:51:11

But also with his death, the wind wall goes away. I will let you know right now that with Woz's death, the Raven Swarm simply dismissed. Let me actually give you descriptions. So the room that you were having this fight in Windows, open to the elements, bring a chill to this room.

02:51:31

A fireplace stands against one wall. It's Ashley's cold next, to a stack of firewood. A trapdoor with a wooden ladder leading to it opens the ceiling to the southwest. But six, light concerts faced about this chamber with a small footlocker. Next to each Grayson, the 20, The blood feather Ravens chambers, This chamber is empty of furnishings on the floor is splattered with bird.

02:52:00

Droppings room's door has been removed but half open shutters bear, many marks and scratches covering two arrow slits in the walls unless the ragged blankets and bits of thatch and straw lies against the center of these wall. Large black feathers are scattered about the room. Lying thickest around the nest and then the final one, This chamber holds this simple bed and a table.

02:52:25

Bearing a water pitcher and basin a fireplace stands in the eastern wall.

02:52:34

That this room?

02:52:44

I think people were still in combat. We are still in combat. This bird had a nicer room than I did back in the cut. Okay. Well that's my movements. Oh no, I have actually 10 feet more. So, then I'll go over here and I guess I'll double move.

02:53:13

Oh, more. Okay.

02:53:23

That appears to be everything here. No way. See why we would still be in combat because there's still a tango alive.

02:53:38

Hmm.

02:53:45

Five footsteps and acute the graph.

02:53:52

On our good. I think it's that one. Whichever one is currently, I know, one of them is. Yeah, this one. Yes, this one. Cool. Pretty girl. Oh, daycare. Is he? No, he's dead. No. I was about. So I'm using Wakazo shoes, which means that it's like timed three so that the chances pretty terrible good.

02:54:17

Yeah, nope. And that's my Before. I'm actually, So,

02:54:27

Oh, gee perception. We got the Tengue, right? Are these Ravens still alive. They should have dispersed snow, They are a sleep right now. But they will disburse when they awaken. We're still in combat rounds because of loads. Can I know that? No, no. You're still comment around because of the one who used vanish.

02:54:53

He's around here somewhere. Okay. OG delay until he appears.

02:55:20

Video.

02:55:27

Move to here. And I'm going to attempt, we take acid spell, I'm gonna hit it. Glitter dust.

02:55:39

Here.

02:55:48

Input radius strand.

02:55:58

Thick corner. Here we going right there.

02:56:13

All right. That thing appears, okay.

02:56:19

Through. I tried to find him. It was a good try.

02:56:29

Apparently we hope it became foot slanted. He's a little tipsy on his feet now.

02:56:42

So,

02:57:05

My kids.

02:57:10

Single shot.

02:57:16

Don't think then it's quite a slept, but it does hit every left footed.

02:57:34

Pack by 13 damage. Oh, the tengu appears. Boom. And then,

02:58:03

Oh, it's already got it in there. Still didn't very nice.

02:58:11

Need two to That really hurt. Poor quite a lot.

02:58:24

And then it's immediately her turn.

02:59:02

And then Koya, throws her star knives, at him, and knock his ass out the window.

02:59:23

Does anyone have a way to deal with poison?

02:59:29

That is a big no steps for Nomi's anti-toxin, which coya drinks.

02:59:41

Okay, I was about to head over and give her my own antitoxit, but doesn't that? Doesn't she still? Oh yeah. Yeah, Scroll of Lester restoration without remove any. Yeah. From there. I'll restore the damage but it won't get rid of the hose. Oh my god, max damage book times.

03:00:05

I know the first one was actually only two.

03:00:15

The anti-toxin is still there. Little plus. Oh yeah.

03:00:27

I didn't know better. I'd say you really want to die. Um, Brain, trying to remember.

03:00:45

Oh yeah, it's gonna cast spell on herself.

03:00:58

More importantly. What kind of place most that? I wonder. Let's played that was round. Three. Does inspire courage give set? No, it doesn't give him. People says you guys maybe watching play a die. Oh thank god. Heck no bro. How safe Sorry. It's just coyas built different, I'm good.

03:01:27

By the way, you go over to quiet, doesn't definitely say. It needs to saves, but is that one that we I'm pretty sure it's too, that would really suck but at least she doesn't take any contest around.

03:01:47

By the way, I'm casting this inquire. Oh, she's gonna stoop down and like, put his hand on their shoulder. Like, he's worried.

03:02:01

We're out of combat rounds, right? Or we keeping them off for the poison. Or you can see one round for six rounds. You can Is it consecutive saves that? Just says, two saves two seconds. So she needs to save again By the way. I didn't. Okay, let me put that on here.

03:02:32

As Jesus Christ. She's already getting like some kind of bonus from like an anti-toxin or anything like that. Gonna heal skill helper. Yeah, you know, hair was them. Ochi has heal. If he could do anything to help he would be. Oh yeah. Does she have? Do you have to a two dual cloak of resistance to use it?

03:02:55

Or could I just scrape it around us over? I don't think there's an attainment time. No little skill. Let me see it matter. But no streets poison. It's a standard action. He's going to take more damage every time. The poison character makes sense or against poison. You make heel check if your heel check exceeds DC of the poison, the character receives a plus.

03:03:24

Four competence bonus on this on the saving throw against the poison. That's a no, I throw the cloak of resistance on her. All right, another plus one then

03:03:40

Come on, clear.

03:03:46

Oh no, I that's a plus six. So a 15, there's not enough that was around four. Why is she not rolling? Any ones don't know, man. I don't want anything to happen. Sequoia By the way. At this point, the opposite goes into a handy habitat and pulls out a potion.

03:04:25

Okay. And has her drink it. I fully thought you were about to be like, any drinks? Just stop with the pregnant puzzles. Boom. Exit, Didn't we establish? The restoration wasn't gonna do anything, They can yield the damage, the currents there, for sure. No. Yeah, that's what it out. We have multiple potions and the scroll of it.

03:04:55

Now. All right, Here on round five. Leave a gun persons.

03:05:07

All right. Now, damage this round. I think that was your final round too? Nope, Round six is the final round. She makes it with a 25 Sequoia. Is fucked the hell up? Hmm, composers. Don't do anything. Nor there. I'm making shits up says Grayson poisonous. The worst fucking mechanic about.

03:05:35

Actually it's much worse than unchanned or better depending on who you ask. No, no, no, no, no. Not from not from like fucking viability point of view. Oh no. No, I'm speaking entirely from a quick air perspective. Do do not play iron gods with the Unchained. Yeah, boys. It's, It's both so weak.

03:06:00

In any way, a player could use it that you cannot make a viable character built around poison and expected lies a complete life. He has a Abby said, challenge accepted. I literally have a character but I have a character that is literally set up to do nothing. But pretty much poison people with one little nick from her.

03:06:23

A rapier Koya? Are you all right? Yeah, you guys have another rank. So let's continue that OG Shagan. Her shoulder, Are you okay? Koya. Koya say something that was the most intense poison I've ever encountered. You are very, very strong my friend. I'm glad you're still with us. Pretty sure I saw stars there for a moment.

03:06:54

Tesla's not ready for you yet. Here's my journey is not a defend. You've got another 90 years in UI. Swear. Ha, I hope not. So I think for today it's probably for the best that we get you back with the others, we have to take off. All right, all right.

03:07:21

We'll see you next week that time already. You. Yep, but if we play this, like later in electric, I'll be up here. The whole game. We won't have this issue. Next time, I had the decouple of walk-ins that were unscheduled. No race. All right. I'll see y'all guys next week.

03:07:46

I would not want to leave you without your, I am. Alright, to go on Only continue with us. If you can Kwaya, we don't want Shoko shakes aside and says would you will be fine on our own for the rest of us? We don't We will not, but you can say that between the potion and the scroll, she's actually only down three con.

03:08:15

Now. Oh, okay. Well, from 13 cotton, We can absolutely give her another potion of lesser restoration. I'm sure we have them. Actually, wait the chi. She did prepare lesser restoration, hang on to the potion.

03:08:42

He casts, another spell does this healing lights surrounds her and she hops back up to her feet, as Giddy is the day. She became a priestess See, that's not sure back. She's just little late, Well trials and tribulations, young. Knowing that's not expect us to go through them. Grayson, what were you doing over here?

03:09:05

I nearly died, just enjoying the view. Um speaking of which and he Grace is gonna try to climb out the window. Oh just gonna look out and see what the heck you were looking at. While he was getting murdered, You're gonna free climb an icy tower. I thought you said it was only 20 feet down, it is only 20 feet down a very fast.

03:09:30

I see a very fast 20 feet here. Oh gee. Oh, hold this rope. Okay, much better. How much do you weigh? Oh god, great question. Hold on a second. What I'm hearing? A stupid ideas. What are you trying to do? I like to think that like, no, I just tons the corner and it's just you with your leg out of a window.

03:09:55

He just like, what? Why of so much to live for? She says it's dead. It should be on the summary page. Yeah, it's on the summary page. Under your religion, near the rest button.

03:10:15

185 pounds. Yeah I don't know. The Ochi can hold you. Let's his 76 pounds of gear. Yeah you're like I don't know sorry. 40 pounds of gear. That's still 200 something pounds. I am a very, very tiny bird, man. I weigh a hundred pounds. If I'm closed as well, though, My drag is 650.

03:10:42

I'm trying to look for where that is on my sheet, it's on your inventory, tab. All the way to bottom, okay. I mean, now we're just kind of looks at you looks at the rope looks outside. Like pans down the thing. What are you trying to do? Hold on, we're doing something.

03:11:00

Go ahead. I got you in. His arms are shaking the whole time. All right. Recent climbs out and slides down the rope, okay? It's still gonna be a DC-10 even with the real because it is an icy wall. So, If you want to take 10 on it and go, slow and steady, you get down without any issues.

03:11:23

Okay. And you collect a bird. Yes. So I I don't know if there's any actual magic items on or not, but that's not the point of this because Grayson is going to make sure he's dead and then it's going to pluck his feathers, including the blood red ones and he's gonna plans to use them to put on his arrow.

03:11:45

Fletchings. Oh, that is pretty neat. Actually, he's just like yo dude, what the actual foot? What have you never killed and eaten a chicken before? I've never skinned a person who looks like you right next to you. You don't look like him. Hey he just you're planners may be blood red 'cause you're covered in blood all the time but but you're not in him.

03:12:22

My own blood. It is his own blood a lot. Oh my god. Oh Jesus. Fine. You guys done fucking around. Can we get back to saving on the go fucking around? He killed the guy that almost killed us three times. There's a trap door over here too. That goes through the ceiling.

03:12:45

Oh, she's gonna say a prayer over all these dead Tangu and the Ravens and our special Raven to Hey Fang, just murmuring under his breath.

03:12:57

Should I just put in miscellaneous gear? Just like a big handful of Raven feathers I you can do that. Yeah. And he does have a small ring on his foots that resizes to medium size and a scrollcase containing a scroll of Summon Nature's Ally 5. Wow. What are you seeing over here?

03:13:19

Shoko, Where does this? Go. It goes up. You have to climbing letter.

03:13:27

Shall we continue? There's also the fireplace up here but contains a flu Grayson offers the the ring to shoko or one of the other casters to identify OG will go take a look at the fireplace because he's the one who read and remembers the and stuff about the chimney flu.

03:13:51

Which I think you already gave us it on the loot sheet but, you know, checking all the boxes. What is it all? I don't applying Starcraft Spellcraft. Yes. So scattered about in the first room where all the Tango were probably not. You get all of this. I'm so sorry.

03:14:12

Abby, there's a lot from this session. I'm not doing it for this game, It's amazing. Yeah, it's grace. And Grayson is our hero for this game. There's so many of these that we need to. Like make sure we say that we drag them out at the end because there's a lot of like really heavy stuff like the bales of the wool that are like 500 pounds, the owl chemical set, that is like 175 pounds, all right?

03:14:43

And in the flu of the fireplace, you find a sturdy, kind of dirty pair of leather and fur lined boots, swag, you very nice boots. I pull them out and I look at them and I sit down on the little stool right next to me with a mirror. And I try them on.

03:15:10

And then some Tango dude wearing like a referee shirt comes over and asks me if I'm finding everything okay that's there.

03:15:23

No, I don't actually try them on because I have cool shoes already but I do want to see what they are. And shovel with that ring shoko The bill bring a protection. Plus one, Would you like to drive for the boots? Look at these cool shoes. I found Shoko slash koya.

03:15:58

Well, times in me, not your not your thing.

03:16:10

McCoya says, those are really cool shoes OG. Thank you for sharing a well you both know they're magical.

03:16:24

And image at their tractor level. Nope, it's the Winterland. So, theware of these boots is able to travel across the snow at their normal speed leaving. No tracks. Additionally, the boots enable her to travel at normal speeds across the slipperiest ice. Horizontal surfaces, only not vertical or sharply, slanted ones without falling or slipping.

03:16:51

Finally Boots of the Winterlands warm their wires. If they were affected by an endure element spell constantly, Those are the opposite of ice gates. They are yes. If we're heading up north after this, eventually those might be super useful. For example, they'll be super useful. Oh, where did Noe go?

03:17:15

Oh, you guys messing around with like Now he's probably gone back looking around trying to figure out where we haven't gone because we are missing one. Commandotsu and one Scion. Yes, you are. Well there's a ladder house. There's a ladder up right here.

03:17:40

But I agree, we'll go. We could sweep on the way down, there's just a ladder with the trapdoor and the ceiling up here. Still. I mean, feel free to check it. Shoko. I'm not feeling super great. Would you mind checking this out?

03:18:01

Soco gives you a look. I just remembered what it looked like the last time show was the one that was asked out fucking door. Any size and stop climbs up and tries to open it. Let me guess strength. Isn't high enough again. No, you're fine. Okay, it just opens it's not locked or anything.

03:18:30

Open. Boom. Apparently that's square isn't working the way. It's supposed to the rooks nest, they wouldn't platform has been built into the Thatcher of the Tower. It is backed by wooden siding. While the far edge is a shear drop off to the veil below trap doors sits in the corner of the roof.

03:18:49

And a small wired coup was a wooden table next to it sits in the shelter formed by the roof's peak entire platform and joining group are thick with bird droppings and numerous blackbirds Flutter around and croak ominously. Have United grapple one and keep it But you finally catch a raven.

03:19:13

Italian and sitting in the bird droppings. Gaining brightly because it's diamond shine, bright like a Batman.

03:19:35

That is all that's up here. Yeah, that was worth looking up there. Yeah, diamond.

03:19:48

I'm just gonna, So I bought like an animal training kit and like a little birdcage when I was gonna get a bird, but then I took it off my sheet and gave myself the money back because we said that I couldn't have one, I couldn't buy one and calls guard.

03:20:05

Sorry, So OG's, just gonna bare hand, stick it into his backpack and then close the backpack. Okay. There's a flurry of angry squawking coming from OG's. Backpack that for once isn't coming from here.

03:20:21

Just wait, calm down.

03:20:29

I don't even know what to call this scenario. Cheer, are you able to talk to crows or Ravens? No. Do you even more reason why? You're not one of them. I'm going to win, aways.

03:20:47

Noise. Like just probably marched off. Probably halfway down the tower and is the bottom looking awaiting for you guys reason, just shrugs and rolls his eyes while looking at that Shoko and Zeo to be like,

03:21:12

I'm stuck in the tower now.

03:21:25

And I mean, flip, You were trapped in a stairwell.

03:21:44

I'm just gonna put everyone down here.

03:21:56

The bones.

03:22:09

Headbutting angel, murderous Monkey.

03:22:39

Okay, so I'm trying to make sense of this year. I zoomed all the way out to look at maybe areas. We didn't explore. You have explored what you think is everything? Yeah. The only place that we didn't go was up the veil because it does look like the past continues up away.

03:22:55

I don't exactly remember the description but if they can, maybe there's more tower up there or something another, there is not actually

03:23:06

So is it just like it's completely walled in by the steep phases up there? There's not like a path to travel up that path past the bridge. There is a secret path out, but it leads out to the planes, not to a secret location.

03:23:24

Okay. So, what we're going to do here is we're going to say after some exhaustive searchings, I imagine you're going to look now for the secret door that you missed. Yeah.

03:23:43

Completely, but and paste. I mean, this is what Grayson's ridiculous perception is for. I'm surprised he didn't find it. That is true, but he checked in the wrong room, though. It was Omayani's room that you checked in. You find the secret door in the dusty. Unused storage closet. They love putting stuff in storage closets.

03:24:11

That was a storage closet. Empty storage room. Not a closet necessarily sorry it's just The room's. All look fucking same. I know they do. New people.

03:24:38

And After a squish opening.

03:24:49

I've heard people complain about this with Paisal before, but like, how you gonna make the only way to advance the plot? Be a secret door and like one tiny room in the lower level. I know there's usually a towel they get better about my player. There's usually a, what the tell on this one was that the cell was being unused by any of the months.

03:25:15

And, yeah, I get that. Now that we're down here, but like, I don't know. Like was it? Not because I speak to remember that. This guy came out of this room. And that's why I thought it was like another one of these, like, generic rooms. Yes, but there's no bed in this one.

03:25:34

Oh, of course, how could we miss that this? I don't know. It's just a real story. Killer from pies oven in my opinion. I know me putting the monk in there was actually to encourage you guys to search it. Well, I I search it. You vastly, overestimated, as this players, I mean, which is my personally, if I had gone in, it wouldn't I've gotten a free search from stone cunning.

03:26:05

If it's stone, it is stone. This is underground. And yes, you should have If you got any phenomena. All right, but again that's why we're just skipping your searching over the rest of this room again. You found it. It's there.

03:26:29

Oh, damn it, is there? Come on folks, I found this secret door. Oh. Is that how we're gonna play? Hey Koya. It's theory. 10. Gold says he gets hit in the face with another wakazashi before he like actually sees who swings it. Oh, she's never gonna kicks. Open this door.

03:26:54

Overcome a brazier in the corner of this room, flows, faintly with red colds, it's smoke. Reminiscent of the stench of scorched flesh, A short bed with a headboard carved with the image of an open mouth demon stands against one wall and a small table cluttered with books scrolls and a stuffed and mounted sturge sits across from it.

03:27:16

That's gross. A magic circle has been scribed in the center of the floor with chalk, torn paper, but bits of food and other. Debris are scattered about the room collecting in corners and under the bed and table. What's up with all those papers? Anything cool or interesting in there.

03:27:37

Last The items on the table. Hold an assorted paraphernalia related to magic research, including a partially ascribed. Scroll of planar binding. The scroll is incomplete. The circle on the floor is an outline for a protective circle. For use with the planar. Binding spell examination of the brazier confirmed that strips of dried flesh, have been burns in it, to create the repellent odor.

03:28:12

That's horrifying.

03:28:19

I do not know of any mantras that would involve stripping the flesh and wearing it on display like that. Hey Zeo, you might know some stuff about this. What's up with this circle? And what could they be trying to do with this? Well done. And letting you know what?

03:28:48

Well, guess not, that's right. Zio's not here. I'm so dumb. He is not here. But as you move into the room to examine the papers in the circle, a very large hand to crawled out from under the bed. Hello Guy and tries to slide your face.

03:29:16

See, You're the one that but wasn't a sword, this

03:29:30

And,

03:30:00

Is that everyone that looks like a plan? No way. You're up first. So I am. What the hell is just knowledge religion for those that have it? Yeah. How about? No hey, you born. But I actually have moments be done. And it's true, but that's fine.

03:30:39

There's anything you'd like to tell me before I take this one.

03:30:45

Yes, quiet does shall don't use slashing or piercing attacks on it. It will explode.

03:30:56

It will what Like what was? It's just. Okay. All right, so rocks. Koya and Shoko. If you guys got so fucking high, the dragon crawling hand is a neutral evil medium, undead, with blank sense and dark vision Standard Undead trade supply. It has an ability called Mark Quarry. A curling hand is a signed a quarry by anointing.

03:31:24

The hand with a drop of the intended. Quarries, blood. The hand has, though, current quarry, it automatically gains the next creature. A damages as its quarry continue to a target, it becomes aware of the target's location as if under the effects of a continuous locate creature. Spell, It also gains a plus one on all attack, roles damage, rolls and skill checks made to seek out and destroy the marked quarry this last until it.

03:31:47

Or the hand is slain husbands when damaged by a piercing or slashing melee weapon, a spray of vile, push strikes. The attacker unless the attacker makes the DC-15. Reflex saves Weapon said provide reach. Protect the attacker. Completely from a, thus first creatures, struck by pus become nauseated, for 1v3, rounds, and take 2D 6 points of negative energy damage.

03:32:16

Give you, you punch the very large hand like, what's going to stop it. And then world's just like okay no stabby, Why is so many things in here? Don't stop it.

03:32:37

Oxford. That's a really fair question. Go.

03:32:50

Okay, circle will calmly approach. The undead hand and uses on that killings. Well.

03:33:07

And roll an 11.

03:33:17

It's study. JC is unfortunately 14. Whom so you don't get him but he's not dead yet either, or you don't lose the spell.

03:33:33

All right. Enter nobody. Not made zombie tokens.

03:33:44

Okay. Phone. If you appeal, if you have a touch attack charged on your hand, can you use it in an attack of opportunity? You need? I would say yes. Okay, I'll just I just never know it varies one of those weird rules. I don't see any reason you couldn't.

03:34:12

I agree.

03:34:16

Requires, once it's up and charged requires less effort than the swing of sword. I don't use agree. He misses. Oh, gee

03:34:39

I'll go there and kick it. I don't know what my role. My bonus is all worked out to be without though it's light, so I can use finesse with it. So just be like, a melee attack, right? Yeah, you just take an AOL here, not profession. That's fair.

03:35:08

What are we doing unproficient? Martial strike.

03:35:17

The boom. You, you hit? I don't know. My damn one. Wendy three, twenty three. And he lashes out at you with a 22 hit.

03:35:37

What's a D4? How do I do a D? Oh like that. I just type backslash roll and then one d3, they go he's winning this this on our fight by a lot. It is what he is. Designed for boom. Anything else on your turn now, that's going to be it racing.

03:36:07

This will come in. See what's going on it, move up and then just as you rushes up to, he's just gonna kick.

03:36:24

And with it.

03:36:34

Kicks are powerful Boy. Yeah. Going to cast your light, our the cure serious ones, that's just going to move up and try to touch it.

03:36:55

And,

03:37:01

Is Right.

03:37:18

So plus 3 to 12 plus then another three adding her decks is a 15.

03:37:32

And she zaps the fucking undead.

03:37:44

And El Carval play over here and but the hand

03:37:59

You should also be adding text to your text.

03:38:11

I will still not fit my long shot. No way. Acromatics.

03:38:23

Why is this thing here? What? I was just a hand groom.

03:38:33

This is very clearly a spellcaster's room and not a nice spellcaster.

03:38:52

And attack does not hit that. Includes your blinking up Unfortunately. We are looking for a 19 for this beast.

03:39:07

Well, I accidentally clicked them to map Shoko.

03:39:17

Let's try that again.

03:39:25

That's better much better. Boom. Boom.

03:39:36

And he does get to make the food safe if he wants.

03:39:42

Oh, that's fair.

03:39:49

And he takes half.

03:40:02

I don't think he does. You see not a corporeal on that all done. He is a coral islanded by touching you with his blade machine. I've encourage you to just staggered pictures, break free a corporeal, unzed creature Touched by this bill instead takes, when he's supposed to damage, He just takes all the damage.

03:40:28

There's no port. He could say the Portage and save is for a living creature, trying to do it break. Free of the staggered as what oozing drugs are flush flow. It's justicated. Bones is successful. Fortitude. Save has this damage. Oh, I did not read Barn up. Then I will add HHP back to him, then

03:40:53

This poor hand.

03:40:58

Bum. Lunky can do nothing to him. The crawling hand has quarry.

03:41:11

And that is all he cares about. Now one to attack plus one damage. Oh gee. He misses, it's your turn. Okay, Let's trying to build it unarmed attack.

03:41:36

Let's see.

03:41:58

How is it for? I didn't even put that in there.

03:42:05

When D3 plus 1. Yeah, strength.

03:42:13

Do I even hit anyways? You do not unfortunately. Well you he's a lot of natural armor so you probably hit it just stuns in doing okay. Oh yeah, you can't do lethal. Can you know the feet. So I'm just punching it, which that's okay. Anyway because it's undead. It's a grace in here, But there's aggressive, want to think of them.

03:42:39

So that's because of what?

03:42:45

So 17, It's actually a lot more than that because I get my my samurai level to that damage. But if it's not least they're challenger. No. The if you use weapon finesse as a warrior poet you get to add your level as a samurai, Warrior poet and your strength.

03:43:07

Yeah. Yeah, you get precise track. Yeah. Fortunately, your attack does missed by two. Boom, cool. Yeah, it's going to concentrate. Happy Boom.

03:43:30

Boom.

03:43:37

And explodes the hand in positive energy. All right.

03:43:51

So, what do we find in here? But yeah, what you wants to look around and see if you can find anything because he's weirded out by the hand of the circle on the ground and everything, it Perception checks for me.

03:44:15

Doesn't look like an imiko and you guys have eyes that can see through time. So, except for shoka,

03:44:27

You guys on your eyes for everybody. So Grayson and the same time as Ochi, you find a hidden compartment in the Demon's head. Mouth. That Ochi finds the trigger to open it and it pops open. Right in front of you, They're doing back to back secret doors compartments. No technically you had to make two perception checks.

03:44:57

One of DC, 20 to find the hidden compartment and the GC23 to find the trigger to open it. I'm sorry. So it's secret door, through two more regular doors, secret compartment and then secret trigger. Yes, Ninjas.

03:45:20

And I'm just gonna give you the sturge one because I don't know who would cut open, absolutely serious. Anyway, Grayson, that's fair and wood Grace and starts stabbing stuff, with an arrow in his hand. Until he hit something hard and then he's like sick. Mmm. Someone's very, very testy today close to me.

03:45:44

Thanks. I'm only teasing I thought for sure you were just gonna kick the ham to death. So, you know, they're very good at kicking the hand to death, I'm sure that happened right.

03:45:59

A sensor. There's a bigger staircase down here. Who said that? 10 through. Stab you all just here, you all just here in your head immediately as you approach. The stairwell. I censor.

03:46:17

Here, very angry and OG runs up to the stairs really. Fast down the stairs. No, he runs high. He levitates No, it was coming with. I'm just whose voice is saying this and no sueys. Gave me an error and disappeared me when I landed on the thingy. The sword is saying I button start.

03:46:48

Oh my it moved me. It just didn't give me vision and moved me over here. Like as a player visibility. No, not like that interdesting. Oh it threw you behind the teleportation tiles. So if you move through them it will teleport you again amazing. Oh, These tiles. That move us are like the the puzzle tiles and like the earlier generations of Pokemon but they're all facing the wrong direction to solve the puzzle.

03:47:23

You. Ochi will politely wait for everyone to catch up Even though he's, oh, all of his feathers are standing on end. So you're just a poof ball right now. Yeah. Oh, gee has gained. What looks like 20% body mass, he looks super swoll right now.

03:47:51

That's everyone. Right. What do we seeing here? What do we see in this hallway? You don't. We're finding out. If you run into it, This hallway, lightens enjoy small chamber. With a door exiting through the south, the door is banned with white straps of iron and bears, a large heavy lock.

03:48:12

A single brazier provides dim lights to this area. That's farther down the hall. Mm-hmm. Back to. So the T stands for. So we keep going totally still to keep going. Yeah, you can go ahead.

03:48:35

There are people here. Very bony people who all turn and look at you. And then you hear in a loud crumbly voice. She said you would come. She was right. Are you ready to die as ready as you are? I'm just letting you know this troll has a charisma of 14.

03:49:12

I dig it. The ball. He is pretty handsome. Can we get a full screen? Yeah, not the word ideas but definitely all more just you can see the 14 charisma in this picture. Yeah, you can, you know, I mean he looks eloquent, he looks a little bit poetic. I'm not gonna lie.

03:49:41

So do you guys have another fight in you? Because we're not gonna get to Kimming datsu today. It's almost six my time. Now I am cool to continue but I could also go hug my baby. I'm cool to do one more. Hi, I will go with the majority. Grayson.

03:50:04

I mean, I can though feels good if this is sort of like a boss fighting, what about waiting for Brazil? But I will do either, That is a good point, I think. Oh, it's a boss fight. I think, Zia would probably appreciate us waiting for him to do this fight because it's a big one.

03:50:19

It's it's the first of two consecutive boss fights. Yeah. I think maybe then the call is that? I save it so late for sale. Everyone can enjoy it. Welcome to the final level of ravens Crag. The one we never would have found without GM Mercy.

03:50:42

This is huge finale of two. This is the big finale of book. Two, it looks sick, I'm excited. Look at these skeleton boys. You got a handsome green boy. Those are actually super old tokens that I made ages ago. They're not really up to my current standards still look sick.

03:51:04

I think you. Thank you, but those were from my role 20 days. Oh man. Galore The lore. I know it was only like six months ago or something. Yeah, not even that got this dude. It was July it. How long is this been going? Because this is always been in Foundry that I start Jade region on Foundry.

03:51:36

Yes, you did. And we could scroll back and find out. March 5th was our first session. Yeah, that's another thing to say. It's pretty early in the year. Okay.

03:51:49

Yeah. Obviously I have not done all the B series. There's way too much I do monsters as I need them. And apparently, I needed zombies for here and I didn't have any zombies ready. So I'm getting skeletons. That's fine. They're just extra. Well done zombies. There you go. Extra crispy zombies.

03:52:08

Okay. I have to go release my dogs now because they are whining. I feel I hope everyone had fun. We shall conclude book 2 next weekend. Yeah, thanks guys. See everybody next week. Hopefully take it easy. Stay safe forward to the inevitable tents in Ochi and Grayson at our next campfire.

03:52:35

And we perfect, uh, there's gonna be some, some party RP, it's gonna happen. All right, guys, I'm out of here. Bye everyone.
