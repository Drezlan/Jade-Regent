You recognize the lacquered screen in this room as the meditation screen that only Yanni used some meditate behind.

03:10:23

He's green itself is worth 200 gold pieces and it's obviously a Tian Ming style. Behind the screen is a small leather trunk in which are kept a washer woman's clothes and other possessions, including a disguise kit, an ornate, blowgun fashion from Jade and lapis. Lazuli not usable as the weapon but worth 200 gold as an art object, 150 gold pieces in Tian coins and a Rit signed by Sven blood eagle.

03:10:54

That gives the bear the authority to commandeer any of the norm kings housecarled within two miles of cows guard for up to 12 hours that onlyani saves for emergencies,

03:11:10

Yeah. Do what you want with it. Take it. Burn it. I I don't care. Fun stuff. Oh, Chico and do his prayer. Christian goes around and like, loots. The various rooms, you find a total of one, two, three, four, five, six, masterwork spears. And,

03:11:43

So five more masterwork screen. I'm just gonna put the the total amount into this chord.

03:11:57

Far.

03:12:02

Oh, dear God. I can actually use a sphere. Favorites, always build it wrong.

03:12:18

Let's go and then

03:12:25

Really, that's it. Oh, I guess only Yanni was supposed to be the final boss in this room.

03:12:33

That would make sense. Assuming you didn't kill her and heard initial attacks.

03:12:48

And then this room is actually, otherwise empty, you guys don't mind if you takes something and I'm not tolerant to you. No, no. I mean there's enough there for everyone to get one.

03:13:11

Yeah, Grayson's gonna take one too.

03:13:19

Can't think of our skin would would overshadow it. He doesn't always have that actually.

03:13:33

Well, that was the thrilling.

03:13:50

Let's be on our way.

03:13:54

I guess going down the other way that we originally going to go to. Yes, just to be thorough. Grayson is going to search the room. That was clearly umayani's for like a secret passage.

03:14:14

But you find anything of the sort in that room.

03:14:23

I have no a help me put the board across the thingy. You need, you get across the rushing waters with ease.

03:14:35

Assuming you don't mind balancing too much.

03:14:44

Water shame, that would be.

03:15:05

Do we hear anything in particular from either of these tools? I mean, we know you hear the sound of water coming from this direction. I think that. Yeah, we want to go this way because this is where we could tell the sword was. That is the door locked. Can I just try it or sorry?

03:15:21

Let's back up. Hold up. I want to see if it's trapped.

03:15:31

They want a second opinion. Oh, she says I don't think it's trapped and he tries the door. Oh,

03:15:46

Check this out, likely for you. It's not trapped. Let me get back up to D2 but there are opens into a natural cavern 30 feet across and 15 feet high. A waterfall. Pours in through a small aperture, high on the south wall, filling a turbulent pool in the floor and sending a cold spray throughout the room.

03:16:09

A smooth ledge extends outward from the door and two large barrels have been set to the right of it. Another ledge sits on the far side of the pool, a smaller cask sits fullness ledge next to a heavy wooden door.

03:16:28

Just a bunch of barrels, casks. Over there.

03:16:44

Do I notice anything strange about the water? Nope, just looks like natural spring water and how high above the water. Are these ledges?

03:16:56

Not too far like maybe the few inches. Okay cool. I'm gonna swim across guys. I want to check this out. Oh no. I walks across. God damn it.

03:17:16

Wet. And you think that like Yep I can move down my speed as a full round action that can go over difficult terrain water been branches. What problem you? It's just cold. It doesn't look like anything. It's in the barrels at the front of the room but the cask next to the other door is sealed and holds an unfamiliar and potent alcohol.

03:17:49

Oh that's not unfamiliar, it's sake from Minkai. Oh, hell yeah, it is a door. Look trap. That's for Gillum sits. Atop the tap, the cask.

03:18:09

Motivated as per gallon.

03:18:18

Yeah, weapon. It is it usually holds. Holy water are. Yeah, no way. Can you take a look at this door? Oh, you want my opinion now? Yeah, sure. White's like takes up, glasses wipes, like a layer of the blood. That was spilling from our forehead and has a look at it.

03:18:45

And it's not trapped. It is most definitely blocks though, and the 29 on that. I was literally just looking at the block.

03:19:15

It's E25. Pops open.

03:19:25

This room is small and musty Hewn from solid rock near the far wall, stands a low. Well it's opening only a foot in diameter a winch and chain with a rusted steel bucket. Hang from the wall above it. The far corners. It's a pile of old wooden buckets and other debris, rotten broken with several different kinds of fungi growing on their remnant.

03:19:53

How toxic are those and how quickly am I going to die from breathing? This thorosin, not that kind of fungus and disappointed. One importantly, looks down this. Well, tries to the squins a bits. It gets very bright further down the well as a katana wedge into this tiny asshole of lights with gold and red flames.

03:20:22

Oh cheese. White and gold. Yeah way.

03:20:39

This is actually important.

03:20:59

It's kind of like orangey gold flames. Hmm, How did you say this was about like a foot diameter. Oh, but yeah. Well, that would be incredibly problematic if right. There you are. I'm retrieving and a will come around one of those down a. Well honestly, who's my goodness. Apparently Google.

03:21:33

Let's complain and more going to fucking gets the book. He claims easily done the well.

03:21:57

Inside up for this. So, very slowly because

03:22:09

This is actually really heavy for him.

03:22:19

Yeah, his push drag is 50 pounds. How broken light heavy? It's like regular katana. Heavy six pounds. So it's it's almost at his lift above head weight and he's kind of got a lift above head. Push not drag. Okay? Okay. I'm hearing a lot of complaints and what I'm actually needing to hear is how far down is it?

03:22:51

Because if you can't pull it, we have this wonderful Fandangled invention, year called rule, I'm getting it. Oh well, why didn't you just send a rope down? Because it was funny funnier to see you get after it. I asked question, even the one who went into this. He me the room time.

03:23:17

We throw it all down to him. Okay, goes through a bag. Pulls up. And last year, is the end of it and hand it. Filing up complaints. With the heavenly Bureau fear. I well, the heavenly bureaucracy can talk in ways until we've gotten back our sail and I would tug on the rope after a minute.

03:23:47

That. And yeah you guys pull out blah ocean endlessly. Excuse me, it's changed. Where did you go? There you are. If we were home.

03:24:13

So this beautiful blade made an ancient Tian style, has both a scabbard and that's so basic looking. I think that makes sense. I it is almost beautiful and its simplicity. It's scabbard is black and glossy and still in perfect condition. And the wrapped handle appears to be made of some form of leather.

03:24:42

That you're not familiar with and the gold. Accoutrement are shining sill.

03:24:53

Fancy that's rings. A cloth out. Whips off. Whatever dust and gumkit managed to get on old adapter. Archie, you're free my friend and he grabbed out of the vomitasu. Very have my thanks for the rest. It is good. Now, that this plan has finally come to fruition, as I foresaw,

03:25:25

They did not foresee the only stealing me before your it's concerned. They've been very hard at work with a concern, you to learn that. They also have our Scions somewhere around here.

03:25:44

It does greatly it. That's the like, literally just drops the sword unless he capture that. And then just what I stand is. Like I said, I grab a gingerly. Well, no no. I said I grabbed it, I grab it and tuck it into like the back of my belt, my little OB.

03:26:09

You can come with me. So here's fun thing. Solution is a plus two defending flaming katana. The endcircle blade of the Amitatsu family and switching can be wielded by any amatatou scion. You don't just have to be a natural ward dependent. You will allow someone who acts in defense of the throne to wield it as well.

03:26:36

You hear that? Grayson. That could be fun. Flurry of katana, Although solution is neutral. Good, any amatatou style. Regardless of the Lightning can Falconing and negative level. This boon is at their discretion. However, and should such a Scion ever betrayed the family or prove. Unworthy. The sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict and because this is an artifact lightly take over your body.

03:27:13

Oh hell yeah. There you go ego. He actually he doesn't have a very high. You go only 25 that is actually a pretty high ego.

03:27:32

Oh neat. You don't need to know that. I don't think any of you are going to try and destroy this sword. I don't think so, don't something to me.

03:27:50

Well.

03:27:55

I loaded the sword in. Thank you way on.

03:28:05

Yeah, buddy. You know, the Amitatsues. Why are you there? What just happened. I was trying to import you into the game waiting. How do I remove you? There we go.

03:28:29

And,

03:28:36

So this might be a little bit of a fine detail. Does does Zeo know anything about what we're talking about with scions and such because he wasn't there. When the the seal was opened and we were made into Scions, he does not We've just been and the seal has not been opened again.

03:28:58

He's kind of like thinking what's what the hell they talking about. He also can't hear the sword. So, that whole conversation, you guys just was just us talking to a sword while he stands behind us, Though. He might think you're all crazy.

03:29:20

I think is a little late for thinking whether or not we are crazy. And potentially just receiving confirmation at this point.

03:29:32

So, if I understanding this floor plan correctly, they expect you to go from wherever I'm stood. Presumably down that way with water is or to go up to where the dojo is.

03:29:54

Which won't be honest. I'm going this way. Think somewhere here, just organic sled me.

03:30:07

You didn't realize yeah, the answer is now though.

03:30:20

Let's drop is a lot. Is it anything? It is that and now it's scroll back all the way up there.

03:30:34

Do you want? Just love how OG? Just kidding me. Moving forward. Yep. Boom. The stairs to send into a plain room of mortared. Stone walls, drip, with convincation giving the air a cold claimy feel, but you were supposed to be coming down the stairs over here.

03:31:05

Looks head back up, shall we?

03:31:26

Don't suppose the sword had the pleasure of knowing what the rest of this down place. Looks like when it was brought down here. You guys got shunted into the way wrong spot. Hold on.

03:31:42

Wow. This is a nice trip that I might token. Just went on that. I got the view a lot of stuff up.

03:31:51

You're supposed to teleport there. Not be dragged.

03:32:02

I'm gonna put everyone in this space.

03:32:10

You this direction. So, I don't accidentally throw you. Rough map by dragging you through the token again like I just did for him.

03:32:25

Rule see.

03:32:37

All right. Now, you may resume you reach this landing with the door.

03:32:53

But I hope I open the door, the 13, Is the laboratory This room has been hewn from the rock of the Crag and a wooden stare rises along the walls, able some workbenches filled with chamber, holding all matter of Olymp Olympic Crucibels, burners, and assorted tools, as well, as a large glass case, holding one appears via humanoid body.

03:33:26

A variety of dried herbs and plants dingle and perfusion from hooks in the bottom of bears and sex and chests. Hold additional equipment and components and have been shoved underneath the stairs. A torch mounted on one of the stairs stair pose illuminates. The chamber with a flickering glow, is this where they made you no way.

03:33:52

She gives you a look as, if to contradict you and then goes.

03:34:08

I mean, I'll I'll happily do do like a perception trick with the skim for anything of particular interest because laboratory laboratory is cool. I think there's probably some give me a perception check.

03:34:30

Boom, excellent. The body is wriggling. Not like the body is still alive. Like there's something in the body. Like, lots and lots of small things and they are eating it.

03:34:59

Hi kind of thing. Would do that? Is it what kind of glass cases this?

03:35:08

It's dirty. Does it have a top on it?

03:35:20

It doesn't actually say how it opens though, I'm assuming. One of the yeah, the top or bottom. Probably comes off, cool. Oh, she's gonna take out a rope. No, it doesn't. And then he's gonna tie the lid closed.

03:35:38

Was about to get violent for kids.
