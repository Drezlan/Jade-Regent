The ceiling of this Grand Chamber. Rises. 20 feet overhead. It's heavy beam serving as both Raptors and supports for the great hall above. Zeke paneling covers the walls in the floors of polished wood, Along the walls, wooden columns, rise. The ceiling above bearing banners and blazon with pictograms, far out, Tianzia above these hangs, small oil lamps.

02:26:42

That give up a dim glow. A small, porcelain bowl rests before the center column to the south and four read mats our arranged before it. I think we go this way. I suspect this might be their equivalent to the dojo. Oh, she steps in keyless. Birdbrained, of course, you do Ouachi.

02:27:13

That's why we like you.

02:27:20

But I actually have to adjust people's positions on the maps because you guys got down here without raising an alarm.

02:27:38

And all without a single stealth rule. Well, I would have done but, you know, You don't have to be sneaky. If everyone's dead, the jumping down, the chute is not something. I think they expect you to do. Well, we didn't want the guy to obviously, run out here, like, raise the alarm and fight the whole place at once.

02:27:59

That was the the World of Warcraft, run away, the fear and pulled more mobs. Yeah. You.

02:28:11

All right, you may resume your moving. Okay. Well, I'm gonna nosy nosy. Well, everyone else is kind of walking forward. I'm gonna check some doors, so I'm going to serendiply.

02:28:31

See if I just checks for doing. So let me still check. I also succeed that but I will probably want. Anyway, that's fair. All right. Yeah, you see this guy in there, meditating.

02:28:59

Hmm.

02:29:05

He looks like he's in an action fighting game familiar. He might be, I'm not.

02:29:19

He does not seem to have noticed you.

02:29:28

I'm gonna do the ninja thing, unless you stop me, but you haven't said anything to us. And if you say anything to us, then we lose the surprise. So, it's really your ball. Point example. Just creeps up pulls out weapon. You have to open the door more than the crack.

02:29:49

Did you do that? Come on though, I'm gonna give him this.

02:29:59

You are my fire. You are fine. You get to them and you get your surprise around.

02:30:16

And I wonder why this realized you were getting a plus four on that. And then, yes, circumstances for it being in dim light because he's human, but it's just yeah. Sorry buddy. My one more a dip. It. And actually you guys wouldn't know or see this. So, I'm not concerned about doing this, a key point to do a different thing as well.

02:30:47

So one, two, three.

02:31:01

Really I really just thought? No, look. Do I?

02:31:15

Wow. No. You don't? Yeah, whatever. Sure. She makes his sonic boom swinging. So hard right over his head. Can't do the cool ninja thing because fuck me, I guess. Okay, cool. Well, you might be able to because now we will do this.

02:31:38

And if you go before him, you'll still do the cool ninja thing.

02:31:45

Yeah, barely. Oh my god. Fuck me to be fair. These are only Annie's best students and you would know that. Yeah, that's kind of why I wanted to take them up. I'm just not deal with it.

02:32:05

But it was a surprise around and this is my actual round. Does that mean I get my full attack? It does mean you get your pool attack because he is not acted yet, so he is still flat-footed against you. Oh yeah, I'll roll for native now. Even if I yes but not for this round.

02:32:37

I'll go ahead and roll my knit up.

02:33:16

All right, no way make here deck.

02:33:26

Of course, that's the one where I recoil of, okay.

02:33:32

This you have any way to add three's of that. I fucking wish if I did not want is Blackfooted? AC is 14. Yeah. Well, there is a really fucked up wall next time.

02:33:52

Food. Oh, none for the matters. You're second attack actually just drops him. Yeah. And as that attack hits, there's those this feedback force and Yeah. Wow. And,

02:34:14

To get a turn. So he ain't get to call out to anyone.

02:34:29

Won't you?

02:34:36

What a shame and Chris, he's gonna go stealthily, open the disc door. So, here we go in. This room has the gear come from right three, jade raven, statuettes.

02:35:09

Masterwork spear and units proper plus one. So, there's sometimes two

02:35:33

To confoon. So you see, you see like no I briefly on the side of your eyes, you vanishes and then comes back and it's just head to pearl. Basically covered in blood. It's in. You got a 21 on your sales check? Yep. I roll the two, you know, that's unfortunate.

02:35:58

You should have a master's here. Masterworks. That's not mess words. Short spears. So just fear. Yes, it's the master sphere from the not often played spin-off legends of Zelda.

02:36:27

Virgin. Oh yes. He seems much more aware than the last guy.

02:36:37

Grayson really initiative for me.

02:36:49

All right, you get a surprise room, you get a standard action or move action.

02:36:58

Will just shoot.

02:37:07

Boom that hits but does not drop in. All right, everyone else. Please join us initiative.

02:37:24

That I don't have any templates to measure.

02:37:42

Getting bother rolling these ones.

02:37:50

Maybe you'll live.

02:37:56

Leo.

02:38:01

Supposed to talking as a reaction, isn't it? Yep. Yep. He shouts an alarm Zeo, yo, zero pretty much. Look at the weather four doors that are in here. And like One of those first stores that opened, they're gonna get somebody hit with magic missile.

02:38:25

Like, all right. He has in his hand for one of magic missile. All right. So you're ready to cancel the spell of the person? I'm easy. Yeah, very good. Grayson. Will attempt to finish them off.

02:38:51

Amongst.

02:38:57

Boom. He never got to act or die.

02:39:11

Open. Boom, door, open, seo, fiery missile, no problem. Boom. He gets battered with them.

02:39:35

A boom. And,

02:39:41

How far out are you in the second range increment? So, -2 dual attack girls' spirit. You you with probably wrong. Oh Koya said on that and then used to be there. Oops.

02:40:08

And I remember to move her.

02:40:19

We'll say quoias turn was moving into the room.

02:40:34

Monk, open this door. Doesn't really see anything from there to step out.

02:40:54

And oh no, he's visible. Currently curses head to toe in blood and probably spitting out a bit of it too. That's what have a spear. Nope, What was Sensei doing with you?

02:41:20

And,

02:41:34

Little where I want you to move.

02:41:45

Rose and Spear. He's crazy, guys. Come on.

02:41:56

Like the spider eater was more dangerous than everything inside.

02:42:11

I mean, I guess technically wouldn't wearing still be on the old's head. Oh no. He was probably still bullying around with okay girl, but no way, cool, cool charge.

02:42:35

Did it?

02:42:42

Might burn my dice.

02:42:47

They are digital. So that could prove difficult, I'd like to do it, You charge, right? I did that includes the charge bonus. Oh, it does. Okay. Yeah.

02:43:16

It.

02:43:25

Your movement is still green. Oh, because you're a monk.

02:43:45

But in that work.

02:43:55

Big second one. Then I don't think either those hit. No, Actually no. I I think it did and putting the blinking about it is an 18. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right? Yeah, yeah. For yep. You right. So yeah, you clock up. This dude comes spinning out of his weird dojo room and delivers a spinning kick.

02:44:29

You know, why? They're all Bruce Lee. Now, in my head, I'm gonna leave you in so many pieces.

02:44:41

He's so fast.

02:44:47

Okay. That's the end. Was moving. Sweet whoochy. Seeing the way. Get ganged up on, he's gonna run up and do some stabbing.

02:45:10

And he will do one on this chain flaking line.

02:45:34

And that's going to be it for right now only 11 damage. I was like I thought I was 26 damage.

02:45:46

Excellent. Work Zeo.

02:45:54

I'm gonna look at the one. That's right. You know. Swing. A throw scare me, which is this one here.

02:46:10

I'm gonna go ahead and love a nice snowball at it.

02:46:24

And he will non-shot lane just like move forward.

02:46:48

Just the one person there, huh.

02:47:00

Well, I am moves up here. Gonna pass through the knife at that dude.

02:47:09

And well that would technically be a hit and they move very similar to only Annies. He knocks it aside but unlike an arrow hurts, our knife flies back into her hand. Grayson. Hey, you know this guy just used up as to play there? Sure to, or it was like advantage of that, it was around.

02:47:39

Yeah. Oh wow. He says, correct no because he already used it for the round. Those first two arrows. Kill him. Um, lose your next target for that third arrow. We'll go to the this one, the one down here. I mean, I'm gonna recommend you throw it at one of the full health like this, dude, because they only have 2983.

02:48:13

Yeah, but they're just gonna catch it. Oh, that's fair. They haven't used thirds like there of they have they? Yeah. So it doesn't really matter who I shoot it at this point. It really hurts his hand. It does the fourth required to deflect. That arrow is insane. Their hand is forever changed in the sorted.

02:48:42

Oh, you stuck out the dead. Let's go on him.

02:48:51

Here we go. Anyway, the time

02:48:58

Symbol.

02:49:11

So confused, whatever. It's tiny school now.

02:49:22

Already.

02:49:31

One step here here.

02:49:39

It cannot blurry. He will just stab. Yep.

02:49:54

You. Okay.

02:53:28

And amongst with the vision completely dodges fire. Oh, gee

02:53:36

Oh, gee

02:53:41

It's gonna do some nonsense.

02:53:51

I'm gonna go there.

02:53:59

All right, i mean accuratic check. Oh, that's not as high as I thought it would be and not as high as you needed. Oh boy or they are fourth level monks.

02:54:21

Boom. Okay, this guy. Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on. Hold on. One second.

02:54:33

How far is that? I don't think I have the speed to even do that. Anyways. So, if I'm doing it with Acrobatics, you would have 20 feet to do that. Yeah, No. I mean, if you just provoke anyway, and work either way, the Europe 25 speed when you're moving acrobatically.

02:55:04

Space Party, 15. He's when you move the space bar, does the turns?

02:55:17

I think it's different for the measure tool, but

02:55:23

Playing not working. Like, none of the buttons are working on it.

02:55:32

So 15.

02:55:42

Okay. On 15, you go there. 25. That was suffice. I guess they don't stop me. They just hit me, right? That is correct because you're not going through their space. Yeah. Okay. And technically you won't promote from him because you're stopping here. Okay. Well, learn bash me one. Beer attack coming your way.

02:56:17

Four points of damage. I'll do it. Are either of these untouched, One of them is, yes. Actually this gentleman, I will challenge that guy. I'll say someone. Why don't you try me? He's alive. Try me quite a sword. Adam.

02:56:40

So and then he'll take a swing on him.

02:57:06

That's all I got.

02:57:13

That will not be an updated unfortunately. Okay. So what is your challenge due to them? Mechanically, it doesn't do anything to them. It's just I take a minus to AC against other targets and I get more damage. Okay, of the round. Then zeo, he will proceed to beat the guy up with his mace.

02:57:46

And buddy with

02:57:51

The boom.

02:57:57

And the end of different.

02:58:02

Gonna come right here.

02:58:08

And continue 11 points of healing to Norway. Yeah. So some of the blood dries up and then start spilling again and just like recuts Jason. I appreciate you. Trying crystal shouldn't the one that's in front or right next to Zeo.

02:58:37

Of course, it's the first era. I'm you know what, You know what, those few natural twenties. I'm gonna say his deflect, arrow does it for him. It goes through his hand. I don't normally use death crate rules, but that was nice. Very nice and that I'm gonna assume the other arrows aren't gonna hit anybody with those roles.

02:59:12

That's it. Unfortunately, that boom. Who started this? Dude's turn. Um, What is their morale? Oh, the disciplined monks, have sworn themselves, completely to the frozen shadow and fights death, got it. Boom. Ochi.

02:59:44

Yours isn't working either.

02:59:51

Those than something terrible rules. They don't hit, yeah.

03:00:02

Hey, no way. Attacking with Larry Bose. Yep. And no.

03:00:21

That dude is very, very, very, very good.

03:00:59

Not even looking again but no way. Okay, for footsteps down and this this guy,

03:01:14

That's two for lightning.

03:01:23

Wow.

03:01:33

That's a thing. I'm gonna go grab a drink. You guys can couldn't keep going. I'll be right. Itchy. I feel like I just went.

03:01:51

Well, the numbers numbers have dwindled. Okay I'll swing on the same one that I swung on last time, twice the one with more health I believe. It's that one.

03:02:18

Of course. Well, whipping going on in this fight.

03:02:26

Feel like Grayson has murdered everyone because he has. Yep, that's my turn. Video.

03:02:44

Why you still showing double buffs? At least one of the entire courage is gone. Oh no. It's not we can have a double buff. No, Grayson is double buff but we don't actually have someone giving you inspired courage right now. So double up is still there.

03:03:13

So zoom will look at this point here and without wand of magic missile. Here we go, ahead and more force.

03:03:31

He drops.

03:03:36

And the individual turn.

03:03:40

It really been a lot of damage going around, then there.

03:03:55

Here you exclude them. I will channel energy, everyone.

03:04:12

Great thin. Oh, are the mayonnaise expected to have the most trouble than this site? Well, Well, shoot the last one that I see that's a lot. I guess to those three attacks around. How would you have them first time? Because they have just like Darrows like this. And then none of his attacks headed.

03:04:36

Oh no. He has two attacks.

03:04:42

Oh good. The Keisha. Clear of those. Oh no. Right now it's it's three arrows. Normally, I'm not even using no this story, but even if you take into account snapchatters, you still have to attack everyone. That's true and three. If you keep right, you all right?

03:05:06

Through food, you're dead off my checker, the one who's still alive.

03:05:20

We're gonna call him. The Second greatest of vomiani students is going to keep trying to kill the first one. Doing a pretty good job, all things, consider

03:05:40

Way in.

03:05:50

Finally, run up under him lump for the fight of him.

03:06:06

Takes one non-level.

03:06:12

No way. Well, I'm pretty sure brands isn't large enough to consider clunking. I don't know. It's not, he's tiny. Yeah, that's bad. It was fine.

03:06:30

As well. This is a cholesterol I can do this.

03:06:40

That's about right.

03:06:50

As is that?

03:06:56

Words.

03:07:01

But,

03:07:05

Can you literally do anything else? But,

03:07:19

Sort of I guess perfect memory.

03:07:26

Bless her protective aura, but he has to be worn for that.

03:07:34

He can do this.

03:07:46

And you get four, temporary treat and a plus one morale bonus on attack rules.

03:07:55

A white bonus one more. I'll benefit attack rolls and saves against fear effects. Gotcha, I think there's an aid bub in the competium.

03:08:09

And then it is your turn. Oh, and that room has its you different description, as well.

03:08:32

Does the casser. Level affect it at the level. We're at only for the amount of time. Okay, cool.

03:08:46

So With that, turned on, he's gonna five foot step up amber. This guy.

03:09:03

Blinking.

03:09:15

Both of those hit but he is still going. I hate it here.

03:09:25

Oh, no one thought taking on a ninja portrait would be easier, right? No. Anything else when you turn? No sorry. That'll be it zo.

03:09:47

Look at him, I target him. And like why do your thing you're one botched but it can't really bunch

03:10:05

Now, the thrill of that interesting combat has ended, no way. You recognize the lacquered screen in this room as the meditation screen that only Yanni used some meditate behind.

03:10:23

He's green itself is worth 200 gold pieces and it's obviously a Tian Ming style. Behind the screen is a small leather trunk in which are kept a washer woman's clothes and other possessions, including a disguise kit, an ornate, blowgun fashion from Jade and lapis. Lazuli not usable as the weapon but worth 200 gold as an art object, 150 gold pieces in Tian coins and a Rit signed by Sven blood eagle.

03:10:54

That gives the bear the authority to commandeer any of the norm kings housecarled within two miles of cows guard for up to 12 hours that onlyani saves for emergencies,

03:11:10

Yeah. Do what you want with it. Take it. Burn it. I I don't care. Fun stuff. Oh, Chico and do his prayer. Christian goes around and like, loots. The various rooms, you find a total of one, two, three, four, five, six, masterwork spears. And,

03:11:43

So five more masterwork screen. I'm just gonna put the the total amount into this chord.

03:11:57

Far.

03:12:02

Oh, dear God. I can actually use a sphere. Favorites, always build it wrong.

03:12:18

Let's go and then

03:12:25

Really, that's it. Oh, I guess only Yanni was supposed to be the final boss in this room.

03:12:33

That would make sense. Assuming you didn't kill her and heard initial attacks.

03:12:48

And then this room is actually, otherwise empty, you guys don't mind if you takes something and I'm not tolerant to you. No, no. I mean there's enough there for everyone to get one.

03:13:11

Yeah, Grayson's gonna take one too.

03:13:19

Can't think of our skin would would overshadow it. He doesn't always have that actually.

03:13:33

Well, that was the thrilling.

03:13:50

Let's be on our way.

03:13:54

I guess going down the other way that we originally going to go to. Yes, just to be thorough. Grayson is going to search the room. That was clearly umayani's for like a secret passage.

03:14:14

But you find anything of the sort in that room.

03:14:23

I have no a help me put the board across the thingy. You need, you get across the rushing waters with ease.

03:14:35

Assuming you don't mind balancing too much.

03:14:44

Water shame, that would be.

03:15:05

Do we hear anything in particular from either of these tools? I mean, we know you hear the sound of water coming from this direction. I think that. Yeah, we want to go this way because this is where we could tell the sword was. That is the door locked. Can I just try it or sorry?

03:15:21

Let's back up. Hold up. I want to see if it's trapped.

03:15:31

They want a second opinion. Oh, she says I don't think it's trapped and he tries the door. Oh,

03:15:46

Check this out, likely for you. It's not trapped. Let me get back up to D2 but there are opens into a natural cavern 30 feet across and 15 feet high. A waterfall. Pours in through a small aperture, high on the south wall, filling a turbulent pool in the floor and sending a cold spray throughout the room.

03:16:09

A smooth ledge extends outward from the door and two large barrels have been set to the right of it. Another ledge sits on the far side of the pool, a smaller cask sits fullness ledge next to a heavy wooden door.

03:16:28

Just a bunch of barrels, casks. Over there.

03:16:44

Do I notice anything strange about the water? Nope, just looks like natural spring water and how high above the water. Are these ledges?

03:16:56

Not too far like maybe the few inches. Okay cool. I'm gonna swim across guys. I want to check this out. Oh no. I walks across. God damn it.

03:17:16

Wet. And you think that like Yep I can move down my speed as a full round action that can go over difficult terrain water been branches. What problem you? It's just cold. It doesn't look like anything. It's in the barrels at the front of the room but the cask next to the other door is sealed and holds an unfamiliar and potent alcohol.

03:17:49

Oh that's not unfamiliar, it's sake from Minkai. Oh, hell yeah, it is a door. Look trap. That's for Gillum sits. Atop the tap, the cask.

03:18:09

Motivated as per gallon.

03:18:18

Yeah, weapon. It is it usually holds. Holy water are. Yeah, no way. Can you take a look at this door? Oh, you want my opinion now? Yeah, sure. White's like takes up, glasses wipes, like a layer of the blood. That was spilling from our forehead and has a look at it.

03:18:45

And it's not trapped. It is most definitely blocks though, and the 29 on that. I was literally just looking at the block.

03:19:15

It's E25. Pops open.

03:19:25

This room is small and musty Hewn from solid rock near the far wall, stands a low. Well it's opening only a foot in diameter a winch and chain with a rusted steel bucket. Hang from the wall above it. The far corners. It's a pile of old wooden buckets and other debris, rotten broken with several different kinds of fungi growing on their remnant.

03:19:53

How toxic are those and how quickly am I going to die from breathing? This thorosin, not that kind of fungus and disappointed. One importantly, looks down this. Well, tries to the squins a bits. It gets very bright further down the well as a katana wedge into this tiny asshole of lights with gold and red flames.

03:20:22

Oh cheese. White and gold. Yeah way.

03:20:39

This is actually important.

03:20:59

It's kind of like orangey gold flames. Hmm, How did you say this was about like a foot diameter. Oh, but yeah. Well, that would be incredibly problematic if right. There you are. I'm retrieving and a will come around one of those down a. Well honestly, who's my goodness. Apparently Google.

03:21:33

Let's complain and more going to fucking gets the book. He claims easily done the well.

03:21:57

Inside up for this. So, very slowly because

03:22:09

This is actually really heavy for him.

03:22:19

Yeah, his push drag is 50 pounds. How broken light heavy? It's like regular katana. Heavy six pounds. So it's it's almost at his lift above head weight and he's kind of got a lift above head. Push not drag. Okay? Okay. I'm hearing a lot of complaints and what I'm actually needing to hear is how far down is it?

03:22:51

Because if you can't pull it, we have this wonderful Fandangled invention, year called rule, I'm getting it. Oh well, why didn't you just send a rope down? Because it was funny funnier to see you get after it. I asked question, even the one who went into this. He me the room time.

03:23:17

We throw it all down to him. Okay, goes through a bag. Pulls up. And last year, is the end of it and hand it. Filing up complaints. With the heavenly Bureau fear. I well, the heavenly bureaucracy can talk in ways until we've gotten back our sail and I would tug on the rope after a minute.

03:23:47

That. And yeah you guys pull out blah ocean endlessly. Excuse me, it's changed. Where did you go? There you are. If we were home.

03:24:13

So this beautiful blade made an ancient Tian style, has both a scabbard and that's so basic looking. I think that makes sense. I it is almost beautiful and its simplicity. It's scabbard is black and glossy and still in perfect condition. And the wrapped handle appears to be made of some form of leather.

03:24:42

That you're not familiar with and the gold. Accoutrement are shining sill.

03:24:53

Fancy that's rings. A cloth out. Whips off. Whatever dust and gumkit managed to get on old adapter. Archie, you're free my friend and he grabbed out of the vomitasu. Very have my thanks for the rest. It is good. Now, that this plan has finally come to fruition, as I foresaw,

03:25:25

They did not foresee the only stealing me before your it's concerned. They've been very hard at work with a concern, you to learn that. They also have our Scions somewhere around here.

03:25:44

It does greatly it. That's the like, literally just drops the sword unless he capture that. And then just what I stand is. Like I said, I grab a gingerly. Well, no no. I said I grabbed it, I grab it and tuck it into like the back of my belt, my little OB.

03:26:09

You can come with me. So here's fun thing. Solution is a plus two defending flaming katana. The endcircle blade of the Amitatsu family and switching can be wielded by any amatatou scion. You don't just have to be a natural ward dependent. You will allow someone who acts in defense of the throne to wield it as well.

03:26:36

You hear that? Grayson. That could be fun. Flurry of katana, Although solution is neutral. Good, any amatatou style. Regardless of the Lightning can Falconing and negative level. This boon is at their discretion. However, and should such a Scion ever betrayed the family or prove. Unworthy. The sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict and because this is an artifact lightly take over your body.

03:27:13

Oh hell yeah. There you go ego. He actually he doesn't have a very high. You go only 25 that is actually a pretty high ego.

03:27:32

Oh neat. You don't need to know that. I don't think any of you are going to try and destroy this sword. I don't think so, don't something to me.

03:27:50

Well.

03:27:55

I loaded the sword in. Thank you way on.

03:28:05

Yeah, buddy. You know, the Amitatsues. Why are you there? What just happened. I was trying to import you into the game waiting. How do I remove you? There we go.

03:28:29

And,

03:28:36

So this might be a little bit of a fine detail. Does does Zeo know anything about what we're talking about with scions and such because he wasn't there. When the the seal was opened and we were made into Scions, he does not We've just been and the seal has not been opened again.

03:28:58

He's kind of like thinking what's what the hell they talking about. He also can't hear the sword. So, that whole conversation, you guys just was just us talking to a sword while he stands behind us, Though. He might think you're all crazy.

03:29:20

I think is a little late for thinking whether or not we are crazy. And potentially just receiving confirmation at this point.

03:29:32

So, if I understanding this floor plan correctly, they expect you to go from wherever I'm stood. Presumably down that way with water is or to go up to where the dojo is.

03:29:54

Which won't be honest. I'm going this way. Think somewhere here, just organic sled me.

03:30:07

You didn't realize yeah, the answer is now though.

03:30:20

Let's drop is a lot. Is it anything? It is that and now it's scroll back all the way up there.

03:30:34

Do you want? Just love how OG? Just kidding me. Moving forward. Yep. Boom. The stairs to send into a plain room of mortared. Stone walls, drip, with convincation giving the air a cold claimy feel, but you were supposed to be coming down the stairs over here.

03:31:05

Looks head back up, shall we?

03:31:26

Don't suppose the sword had the pleasure of knowing what the rest of this down place. Looks like when it was brought down here. You guys got shunted into the way wrong spot. Hold on.

03:31:42

Wow. This is a nice trip that I might token. Just went on that. I got the view a lot of stuff up.

03:31:51

You're supposed to teleport there. Not be dragged.

03:32:02

I'm gonna put everyone in this space.

03:32:10

You this direction. So, I don't accidentally throw you. Rough map by dragging you through the token again like I just did for him.

03:32:25

Rule see.

03:32:37

All right. Now, you may resume you reach this landing with the door.

03:32:53

But I hope I open the door, the 13, Is the laboratory This room has been hewn from the rock of the Crag and a wooden stare rises along the walls, able some workbenches filled with chamber, holding all matter of Olymp Olympic Crucibels, burners, and assorted tools, as well, as a large glass case, holding one appears via humanoid body.

03:33:26

A variety of dried herbs and plants dingle and perfusion from hooks in the bottom of bears and sex and chests. Hold additional equipment and components and have been shoved underneath the stairs. A torch mounted on one of the stairs stair pose illuminates. The chamber with a flickering glow, is this where they made you no way.

03:33:52

She gives you a look as, if to contradict you and then goes.

03:34:08

I mean, I'll I'll happily do do like a perception trick with the skim for anything of particular interest because laboratory laboratory is cool. I think there's probably some give me a perception check.

03:34:30

Boom, excellent. The body is wriggling. Not like the body is still alive. Like there's something in the body. Like, lots and lots of small things and they are eating it.

03:34:59

Hi kind of thing. Would do that? Is it what kind of glass cases this?

03:35:08

It's dirty. Does it have a top on it?

03:35:20

It doesn't actually say how it opens though, I'm assuming. One of the yeah, the top or bottom. Probably comes off, cool. Oh, she's gonna take out a rope. No, it doesn't. And then he's gonna tie the lid closed.

03:35:38

Was about to get violent for kids.
