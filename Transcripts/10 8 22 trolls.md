No, I don't leave Butters some sort of curse in Varky you're fairly certain it's occurs just from her reaction and like half draws her sword when you touch her invisible. Oh, come on now. Sorry, she just kind of does that?

07:52

You should not do that when we hunt those of your kinds.

08:00

No, but you probably should have seen me coming So I do not have a way to see that, which is unseen. This is victim blaming, Isn't it? Just,

08:17

Oh wait, does she? Oh, five ranger. No, she isn't irrelevant sprayed. Well, let's march shall we know. He says it's clear. No, I said there's a weird fucking nest at the top of the stairs that's at the top. That's the stairs are fine.

08:41

I'm gonna be real. I don't understand how these stairs are supposed to like how they're supposed to be. Is it too landings with two separate ways up or is it like a full spiral thing? It's a full spiral thing. There's actually another landing for us to go up. So you go up to here and then all the way up here.

09:04

Oh, I see This isn't the high point. This is the high point. Yeah, that's crazy. Okay, that makes more sense. I was like, this is you could have drawn this better, they could have and I didn't, I didn't remake any of the Jade Regent masks because I love them, but they don't translate too.

09:29

Well into VTT. This is the only one that I've been really confused by so far. The rest of them have been really cool. This one I was just like very large image. I was I'm like I feel for whoever had to draw this one up like you want to top down view of a cliffside staircase.

09:47

Got it.

09:54

Oh, sounds good. Let's get climbing.

10:00

Monkey in the helmet. Sort of letter up in space. Let's remember that. Sans said doors, you can click all of them and they will teleport you now to where you're supposed to go, and they will do the lock thing if they're locked like before. But if they are trapped, they will also go off.

10:22

So if you're checking, if it's locked, we need to communicate that because if you just click, you're gonna, you have a bad time.

10:35

Do not have that implemented yet. To be fair, I said I was trying to figure it. Oh, I thought you said you had it in already. I was like I can clicking nothing. No. But you you can use all of the stair landings.

10:52

That's rad. Oh, she's gonna get within a couple of steps of the thing and look at it. Is there card? You a perception to gain any more information they have or role? I know it's check. Well not from that square, you don't have to you can do a knowledge.

11:10

Check is it emerges from its cocoon? Why, why why?

11:20

OG just let water to learn. He didn't want to die. It wasn't reason why I had more like go like this far and then just went like looked back saw that and just backstep like moonwalk just like, okay okay this is oh we're doing this guy's cool. He eats spiders, that's fine.

11:40

He's a homie. This is a this is a house pet. That's what this is. These guys look good. Little trained guard, dog. Just go a little hands for high fives. Why does it have cancers? Because it's got a bite attack two pincer attacks and a sting attack. I don't like this.

12:02

How do I fight a complaint? Um so it's a magical beast. So knowledge, art cane Arcana. Unfortunately are our conduit is not here but ocean in my mind. Yeah, dude. Oh gee, this is a spider eater. It is a large magical beast that contract you by scent. Wow. But I missed it having a sense ability.

12:43

That's part of. Yeah, I forgot that she was invisible when she like walked up. I was like, no way walked up and nothing happened. So something should have happened actually Um blah. I was I was fully expecting it to kind of like come out and attempt to I well, I was expecting a swarm of stuff to come out.

13:04

Frankly. That's why I was like, we're going much. I'm good. So it only has two special abilities. The first one is this poison which has a decent 40. Safety. 17 frequency one minute for five minutes. You only have to make one of the saves. But if you fail, any of the saves, it's effect is paralysis for 1d6 plus five weeks.

13:32

Sorry weeks. Yeah, you heard that right? Como. None of this guy will see paste. Nanny money. Good. Okay. So we shouldn't have a side. Like oh she's gonna yell that out. Oh, not even done yet. It has one more special ability. There are two. The other special ability is called implant, are you?

14:08

No, no, no, no, this. None of your large enough. This what? You could be a father? This is absolutely. I'm here for you will. I'm sorry it. Paralyzes, you? And then I'll be positives. You this business straight out of the book. I have not modified this campaign guys. It's not even like a cute like yeah, then you have a baby.

14:40

It's like it eats you from inside out that's horrifying. This is this is Xena mall. That's what I'm hearing this they said you know what we should put in in Pathfinder bot flies a giant botfly. Oh no.

14:58

What was wrong with the infestation spell? Oh, she just goes.

15:05

I'm trust it right? Super hot. Oh no. So roll for initiative. Roll birds. Yes.

15:21

This feels bird racist again. No way. Nobody got to walk up. He's like you're fine. We like you. I just miss her having sense. The bird comes out. React. There's like, what the fuck is that? Get off my wall.

15:39

I used to assumed her invisibility with let her buy. No, I, I was not sticking my head in there for fear of like a swarm with fun blind since something waking up. He just worked within like 10 feet and wanted to check out the hive and you'd see if he knew what it was.

15:57

And it's like, oh hello. We don't, it makes you feel better. She's not gonna impregnate any of you. You're all medium sized. No, no solicitors. Get off my property. He was fucking Nordic. Barbarians are back was trying to sell me axes. I don't know. That was a bad dude.

16:24

No, that's good. I was trying to think of like some some like Utah jokes, some some bike helmets and bikes rolling up. The 90 foot staircase.

16:39

He? YouTube.

17:06

Boom. Oh no. One beat the spider eater.

17:17

Um, Well Ochi

17:24

Here comes the bite attack. I don't want to dig myself any kind of hole. I'm sure there's maybe a rule for it that like it can't even try if you're not a large feature, but like, does it know that? I'm too small to get pregnant. Well, I mean, I assume they intrinsically know that they need someone who's large because I mean even their poisons minimum duration, is the sixth week?

17:52

Incubation requirement though, instincts. Mmm, this is around my type. We are pincers primary attacks.

18:11

I want to say, yes.

18:21

Just by size, I want to say yeah, this pencil is really as big as his face.

18:31

And, and this thing,

18:43

Um okay, so that's all of his attacks against your black booty. They see every single one of those hits me. Oh my Wait.

19:03

Wait. All right. Wait. Okay, minus 5 of the pincers. They are secondary attacks, okay?

19:20

I don't have what's it called yet. Do I you don't have uncanny do you? I don't think I do is an auto took other stuff, and I don't have it from being sneaky. Yet the pincers are 13 and 14 against letbuded. Okay. The pincers don't hit me. The first one, the bite hits me.

19:41

And then the sting also hits me. And okay, then

19:53

It does not confirm against me though. So that looked really scary but I'm kind of okay, but I need to fort save, right? Yes, I am. Turning it into, I've worked there for you.

20:21

That you can click. Okay. I want to use resolve to roll twice and take the better. I have to do it before. I just say it before I roll. I don't lie.

20:50

I don't know why it has a role button for that but there it is. So, all the charge list. Yeah, pretty much.

21:05

There's one. Let's roll another one. I didn't like that one. There we go. You make your save. So, you are not poisoned, but she just cleanses clenches, his cheeks and he's good to go.

21:31

Little little bird cheeks. But you know, occurs is cloaca.

21:57

Resolve coming in clutch.

22:07

Think of the dark, it's easy is 18, Of course it is.

22:18

No way, boy howdy. I wonder what I'm gonna do. Probably should appeal. Don't you first. I was full health, but I think always talking about Koya. Yeah, koya can live her own life. She doesn't have to just always just walk around with her hand on my shoulder. Just does not always have to do.

22:48

I did not have any of those, but So this thing can't see me but it can smell meters. I yes but it has the major perception check to pinpoint you. So, it is still flat-footed against you.

23:06

Nice.

23:10

Except I rolled like incredibly bad. I imagine you and 0.

23:24

Actually hit the. Hey, come on.

23:32

No, it's not turning any of that arms too because it hasn't been pointed me single attack, but I don't know. Why does it think that I correct?

23:52

I'm gonna have to fix some buttons. But in the interim, 14, a flat foot, a 14 hits, as well. I put it exactly. Actually.

24:06

Pool and while I try and fix my macro. Yeah. Yep. Queer Just going to zip back into invisibility. We are, we are not playing this game today. So that is and bye. Being oh but if it did hit two things one it takes three blade and two. Oh actually three things because I keep forgetting.

24:30

I have fun singing stripe So it takes three, bleed, damaged. It's natural armor, is reduced by three. Yeah, and it then becomes sickened for as long as it bleeds.

24:43

Right? I would not want to fight you three. I don't worry the natural llama reduction stacks, Is it? Because it kind of sounds like, she would just peel your skin off in combat. Yeah. Not the ochi has any armor to peel off but like yeah I don't want to be a naked bird bleeding everywhere.

25:08

Throwing up while I'm getting shanked, like all of the ninja you've seen have been pretty precise fighters and now is just like home. So, just Not bad.

25:24

All right, the spider eater may be less scary than I thought it was. I'm hoping we don't have to burn a bunch of our resources, right? In the direction, the gate I know? Yeah. I was a little scared of this guy because he's the CR5 and it was like really right at the door guys because he can paralyze you.

25:45

The five week power of paralysis is mildly terrifying. That's fair. Okay. Um, Oh, she's scared. It just like started flailing at him and like, stabbed him full of some bug juice and he didn't like one bit of that stuff. So he's going to draw his swords as a move action and then do a stab.

26:19

Fighting with combat expertise. I don't actually know, actually, that is defensively and all that stuff is confusing, but I'm pretty sure. It's just part of the attack. I turn it on, right? Like power attack. Uh yeah, they're they're buffs in the compendium. You can use if you want to use I was mostly just worried about the action cost.

26:39

But I believe it's just when biting defensively is just fighting defensively. You get the bonus. AC of minus four board gear attacks. I'm gonna go turn it on. Yeah. This was for that total defense. I see of the combat expertise. Yeah, it's a defensive stance in elephant in the room one that I pulled.

27:01

That's what I wanted. So there's that. Let's do our tack here.

27:10

I get none of these cool bonuses.

27:18

That's a mess. It's a hit. He's sick. And he's now 15. Yeah. Helping. Oh, not from second, sorry from her flexing off part of his carapace. Okay, and then laying it out like a filet mignon. Next to you on, on the wooden things. And that's pretty much OG's turn.

27:50

He gives him one. Good stab said don't touch me. Um, okay.

28:00

Do we feel like we would have had our weapons out? Coming up to this thing. I always assume you have your bow and hands. It's a both, they may show bows being flung over the shoulders like that in movies, but people rarely treat their both like that. Yeah, it's not good for your boat.

28:17

People who use bows, don't do that.

28:22

Um, I guess all I'll do a flurry of us, I won't do the extra key shot. Gonna try to conserve key for when we fight something that you won't need it. Anyways, not with how often you hit.

28:37

And it will do risk and only Harry can, well HP, the grace is gonna kill at six times over. Boom, The first shot. Killed it. Sorry. Just three times over my bad. Thank you, Grayson. I don't feel great Koya. Could you help me?

29:18

Well given the color of these that's coming out of your sting folder are my twice suggest chugging. Those anti-toxins, I don't they just give you a bonus. I was like, we have a specific anti-toxin for the spider eater. Nope, you have generic anti-toxin liquids that if you drink them you get plus 5 alchemical to your saves for an hour That's radical

29:57

He says a hero a small bottle. Hit the deck. Big, big forgot to rest quieter.

30:14

I nearly forgot. I had two free uses of vanishing trick per day. Thank you. Only honey. No way he says in her glowing magical adidas. Tracksuit. Hey.

30:36

When you're out of line, you're right.

30:42

That's how I imagine us. The key users in the party rolling for the rest of this adventure is just the three of us, like, like the stylized where they made, like, Disney characters with like gauges and tattoos and stuff or like made them all, you know, gangsters like, alternate style.

31:00

It's just a three of us and Adidas, tracksuits for the rest of this thing. Following a makeover around. Are you ribbon flying that? We're actually just gonna be the equivalent to the Russian Mafia for America? Yeah. But like a, you know, like an Alaskan mafia because we're, you know, So I mean, I'm a bird but you're erotaki or Yeah, erotaki, right?

31:28

Correct. Yeah.

31:33

I guess I should do this now before we get in there because this last one I'm Grayson will concentrate for a second and spend a key point to use bark skin on himself noise. Boom. Boom. I keep being proven about my earlier statement that you're freak of nature grace, and then I'm glad that you are

32:04

But I can keep proving you correct.

32:13

The freaks were more fun. We should be very careful. If this was the front guard, they these things can paralyze you. I don't know how I fought it off, but These are very dangerous defense. Measures it. What is here? We moved. So well, they're definitely never going to be bothered by solicitors with this thing.

32:38

Yes, seriously.

32:47

Oh, that's cool.

32:54

Although I think the five foot squares are set 10 foot squares ah maybe they are 10 foot squares. Yeah. Equals 10 feet. That's lit. Uh yeah, you're right. You're right scale 5 feet.

33:18

Oh yes that's much better. Okay. I was like why does Coyo only have three squares of green movement? That makes zero sense. Yeah, looking at. No ways earlier when we started, I was like a she'd slowed down.

33:33

I hope not my speed is all have gone for me. Is Coyas like group buff speed increasing things still going. Yep, it's just shared with us permanently, I think while we're around her right now, well, you're caravan bonded tour.

34:02

This one didn't do. The thing didn't work. Now unfortunately,

34:18

Thank you for healing me by the way, for you. Of course, darling.

34:27

Thank you for never being boring. Your vet. You're very welcome. See Cleo. I get.

34:50

Ravens. And state. Okay. Now, I don't think I can. I think I'm frozen.

35:07

The u to the wrong side.

35:24

I'm reloading because I'm very frozen right now.

35:33

Into.

35:49

Here we go.

36:07

Thank you. Come ninja running through the wall. So, to

36:22

Actually run like that but no way. What is the benefit of them running with their arms behind their back? Like that. The last time I tried to do that, my mother broke my arm for a week. So, I couldn't tell you. It's cultural. Don't be disrespectful.

36:44

Is obnoxious to say that the culture is bad. Then no, no. Just just racist. Oh, I can handle that.

37:07

Oh, during the time that I was gone, Things are happening. Yes.

37:22

This year seems like a lot of people for them. Not having many people left. No way. Oh she says Scott for 10 years. What do you want from me?

37:35

OT says brothers, brothers calm down. There's no need for this.

37:44

This wide ports amounts, the rickety conglomeration of stairs and landings below. Providing a panoramic view of the boggy. Plains. That extend the hazy horizon, The Lumi green gracestone Hall of the fortress blocks. Further progress, Inset arrow slits. With heavy wooden shutters flank a bronze banded portal that leads within Above three more arrow slits.

38:09

Look out over the precipice.

38:16

This is the part where we need show go here to just do like to and then I can do pretty soon.

38:30

I just shoots right off at the front one. Oh my all of those hit.

38:43

And he dropped like a bag of feathers.

38:50

All right here I don't think their hair to be very friendly. Welcome party, guys.

39:13

Monkey comes running along the rail, but

39:31

Two.

39:47

Very politely makes their way past you guys.

39:57

I want weigh-in and Helgerval to like do like some Voltron stuff where they like fuse together make like an armored flying monkey.

40:17

And shotgun.

40:24

Get it. You're a wanderer. I've never known the var key to do such a dance.

40:34

But those are doing. Oh yeah, thank you.

40:42

Being Tango ninjas are going to step here.

40:54

And visible.

41:08

It picks their sneak attack.

41:47

And stick to shocker. To seem as relatively unbased by it actually because he a bit global range here with a 16 gum station. He is. He's good. Don't need.

42:10

OT is going to yell out where's a Mako in Tengu and then charge one of them and do some stab.

42:24

Really good.

42:36

And I will do that and make a necessary checks for acrobatics if you want us to swing on me or to avoid him swinging on me.

42:52

So, you're fine. He's gonna draw, obviously, because he's gonna do a stab. So, during that movement, though, I will do a little sneaky sneak. No. Actually, I don't need to. I will anyways because I want to. Yeah, you like that? Each, excuse me.

43:22

And what he'll swing on him.

43:30

And cry. That was a really, really sad attack from Ochi.

43:40

Yeah, it's okay. It gets better, that's gonna be my turn, I guess.

44:21

Oh, Holgar. Arguable. Oh, Wow. All right. So he said that Tengu's shirt on fire with a gout of flame in his lizard.

45:06

The. Nope, no way. Mm-hmm.

45:24

So both of these invisible this so I can ignore them. Like so they are not invisible, but you appear to be they're not invisible. Okay, cool. Bear blurred. Okay. I thought that was whatever reason I thought that was invisible. That's fine. In which case then you guys have got that one blanked.

45:48

I'm gonna just stab this guy. And we'll see if I fixed my mac. I hope I have Have, you made invisible buff yet to turn your token invisible because other thing you can do I mean I can toggle the both visibility state but then you can't see them.

46:16

Which is more accurate to how it should be but I don't think she can see them either. Correct. That is the slight problem. Yeah. Geez.

46:34

He dies. He does he didn't even get to do anything. He was the most ineffectual ninja this entire campaign to date. I'm right here. You're working on it. She says she vanishes again. Oh sorry. Anything else on Eastern? Well no that was that was it. I'm just reducing my key, Grayson

47:05

I've just shooting the one that I see and then we'll take a 5 foot step. Like, I keep forgetting to roll their 20%. Miss chance. Don't forget this. Yeah. Do you want mine? I mean no, it's this fine. Okay. I don't know why blur just vanishes as above in my head OG pool hours forward.

47:37

Let's go. Alrighty. Main landing from the great hall.

47:52

Rows of pillars support, the 40-foot high group of this long haul or just set into pillars sconces and two fire pits set with iron spits in the center of the rushroom floor. Give the room a ready. Glow. Several doors open into rooms on either side beneath 10 foot high balconies lined with beasting tables, that's bar into the hall.

48:15

Like 15 foot high balcony with the master's high table. Looks out over all spoke holes, cut into the roof, high above allowing more light, and the croaking of the many ravens that roof on the roofs. Rich pole that roost on the roofs Ridge Bowl, occupies. Oh, So I haven't seen him yet.

48:38

But over here is like tables for feasting or in the main hall is table in the main halls tables for feasting. So over here are the feasting tables because they are 10 feet up. Yeah you would go up these stairs here to get up to the feast tables. Yeah, I just wanted to visualize it.

49:03

So yeah, that's like our rooms underneath. Got you really rad? Like I said, beautiful place. That's a lot of options on where to go.

49:20

It really is track them. All we might as well start searching and oh she's gonna walk up to the store on the right. Yep. He turns around and looks in a way. Oh no. It's first before the store gets booted up and okay. Oh, she is gonna. Can I check the door?

49:46

See if it's trapped. You certainly can. What is that skill? Survival. Finding traps perception, Okay?

50:00

It was worth a shot. Oh, you can find basic man. Named apps. You do not find anything on the store. Okay, cool. He opens it.

50:17

That looks great haul. This is a guard room arrow. Slits, are shuttered and lashed on here. On the inside though, they are empty safe for piles of rocks and broken rubble. Nothing in here.

50:45

This room is the same.

50:52

All right.

51:04

Yeah, hmm.

51:26

As you get around the sensor of the hall. Oh, come on. I was long tool. That's why that's cool, The Ravens and the roof, and Raptors take wing.

51:51

Mmm. So, this is where Shoko summoned them from.

52:05

Mmm, I think country.

52:28

You might be happy to know that this is a tiny swarm.

52:42

So they can be damaged with weapons. Oh good, It's half damage but they can still be damaged. No way.

52:59

Can be damaged, but it's half damage. And there's still immune precision. My game is paused for some reason so I can't move anything. Thank you. Um,

53:25

I'm gonna So how far for these from today at people hike? Oh yeah, they've come down to eat you. Oh wonderful. Definitely not not concerning.

53:42

Oh, whatever. I'm gonna move to like, to take up that hole, nine square.

54:00

Now, I'm gonna do, I'm not even gonna draw my second weapon. I'm just gonna punch.

54:14

And you.

54:22

Those were all supposed to be hidden.

54:29

I'm see anything.

54:45

Oh boy. You punch several reason or raisins Ravens, straight out the air. Yep. And then immediately like, I'm not handling this. Well guys, but you know what? I fucking hate these birds.

55:05

And that is the end of my turn. That Faulkner? Yes, it is. Well, and welcome here. You just in time, give me a couple minutes to get there there swarms. Oh, I don't know if I have anything that I can deal forms right now, especially if we haven't had time to rest.

55:32

You did have a night to rest, okay, so now I gotta make a quick change to myself and whatnot. Yeah, remember we ended with you guys camping, Okay? I, I could remember what was going on. That's right. I mean you know dealing with a pain and my in my chest and everything.

55:52

Awesome. It's gone wrong, really fun? Sorry to hear that Wait.

56:07

What am I talking about? I did have a spell set for and prepared.

56:16

I just got hit the rest button. Requirement shit back.

56:26

Okay. Now I'm here. Now, pencil And would I be at full health? You were very close to full before you rested. So you were like three quarters. And yeah. Clear was stopping everyone off. I think you dipped out a little early last session. Oh yeah. Koya was what helping everyone off.

56:52

Okay. Okay. So,

57:01

Where exactly? Am I you Avengers Ravensgragg After climbing the 90-foot rickety? Which back? He wooden stairwell and ochi almost getting eaten by a spider eater. Oh, I'm an apparently in a different area than everybody else. Oh, I am going to you. I see you on this map. I mean I'm on the the landing area.

57:38

16.

57:44

Over here and scoop you up.

57:53

Did that work? No, I'm still in where I see what appears to be a Sarah. A stairwell.

58:04

Right. Move your camera to the upper, right?

58:14

Yeah, I don't, I don't see anything in the upper right. Hole you over here.

58:22

And an upper right area is completely black. You should be able to see your yoga. Now, I can't see because

58:37

If that's better. When I have had time for all this to activate like my Auburn Mass. Yeah. We've had two combats before this. Yeah, If you want to put me jam around your mobile YouTube, Okay, make government and then I guess I heroism. I'm gonna need all the help I can get So a ninja steps out of that doorway over there.

59:18

And then cannibalism happens. Here.

59:35

Little swarm.

59:41

But only one point of damage. Oh no. Okay, let me see the Raven. Swinging is different. They don't have the distraction.

01:00:00

That I Okay. Oh, I guess I might want to roll for my next alarm. Yes.

01:00:25

Wait, another thing about it did you Did you divide my punch in half? I did why?

01:00:37

Why wouldn't I limit something? A swarms take full down from one if there are time.

01:00:47

Your point is well made That's why you just just I was wondering why you decided to punch it and that makes I wonder why I did. Why it was my goat that I was like there was a reason wasn't there. Sorry I went in double check, I'll be quiet now.

01:01:08

I'm sorry please yo nope you totally fine. The punch was just out of anger at the Ravens. She's so it was She couldn't even I don't know if flying kit followed but followed by like fuck you. Hey. Okay. What now? I rake. Yep. I I do not consent. I choose not to Well they're doing it without consent because there are I'm calling the cops dude, I mean the cops here all ninjas.

01:01:47

I don't think they hit me. No, you do not get iranked. Little bones. Oh gee spends his head all the way around, like an owl.

01:02:07

I love being a bird. I am going to do a bunch of stabs on them. I'm fine. Question mark. Yeah, I'm just gonna hit him a bunch of times. I don't think he's smart enough to not like do slashing damage to these birds.

01:02:41

I'm gonna spend a key point though to do more stabs.

01:02:49

Where's my thing? There we go. I did not need to make that public. Nobody cares.

01:03:03

I'm gonna mention that wouldn't drink that too.

01:03:09

And stealing one inches, it comes recommended.

01:03:24

It have damage. It's app damage. Misses unfortunately, it's fine. And that's what it does. You cut down several of your smaller less intelligent kid. Less intelligent is a bit of a stretch. Ravens are really smart. I mean, that's fair. What is Ochi's intelligence like 10? Yeah, they're lesson. Intelligent you?

01:04:01

He completely ignores the ninja.

01:04:30

I don't have them playing, that's why I was like why is it saying their speed is solo?

01:04:37

They just march across the ground shorts, just born kid of crap. Oh, that sounds. Even more terrifying are still much more intimidating and just determinedly. I just realized I had the spell. I have supposed to deal with these things, but somebody might get hurt. Oh, no. Do it anyway.

01:05:06

You just well, I'm not gonna be responsible, anybody die.

01:05:20

Oh, shaka.

01:05:27

Lucius screamed in pain as her eyes are gouged and scratched. It's a temporary blindness. Apparently, you know, because eyes are famous for their regenerative abilities.

01:05:51

Boom, where you in?

01:06:05

Excuse me, OG.

01:06:12

Yes.

01:06:30

He just blows a gout of fire out of his mouth insider hitting the rest of the Ravens.

01:06:43

OG just gives him a high five.

01:06:50

No, I was trying to not be on fire. He barely missed you too. Just,

01:07:03

Oop, shotgun you right? There is going to swing blindly and the swarm kind of a panic sort of dealio. Um, we're gonna go high for her to hit and she misses

01:07:30

OG panics is a door opens right next to him. That's okay. The Ninja looks just as surprise to see you right at the door. It's touch. Basically. It's adore again. It no open door, not, he's still there. He's still there. He's still there. He opens it just in time to see.

01:07:53

Oh, she's standing there with his swords, like skillfully sweating birds out of the sky and then a monkey, like flame breath, a bunch of things. So he opens up the door. Just slowly closes the doorge.

01:08:10

Does anyone got no shaka has what a knife thing.

01:08:36

Wheeled in different wand in each hand.

01:08:45

The boom. Boom, this guy wants to go through the door but he can't. You're there that guy.

01:09:06

Probably have a Singham Ryland because they're fancy daggers. Well, they have normal daggers too.

01:09:21

I mean, I that he just shanked out you with

01:09:31

Oh. Oh. Dear Grayson Chris is gonna fire at the the ninja weighed down here because he sees Ochi's blocking that doorway and is gonna try to prevent the the stem of reinforcements. Also, I feel like I used to have blunt arrows that I use blink level one or something, but they're not in my sheet.

01:09:58

So I'm just gonna assume I don't you buying a blunt arrow, he used blood arrows on the ninja. No, what's gonna use them on the swarms? But yeah, I know. But I gotta find him. I am again or something. How annoying would that be? No, I remember you having those.

01:10:18

I do too another quiver on your sheet but that would be hilarious, You're like nerf arrowing. The ninja just trying to attack us but you're attacking him correct. Correct. The boom. He made a mistake with his AC, if 15. And then I'll take a 5 foot step and then that'll be it.

01:10:57

All the way on goes here.

01:11:05

And Belches of blast of Fire at the Raven.

01:11:37

Services, both as he goes. Nobody else. No way.

01:11:48

Can you see invisible things? Oh, give me. I will switch. That took shaka who is blind. It takes narrows of the face. Sorry. Oh, maybe not her faith. Takes an arrow with a knee. Not the knee. I don't know why. So it's terrible. It's just

01:12:19

That an aerodochi, that a hit over. Really. Oh no it's not. I'm sorry. I was still, I don't care. That's like 21 and 22. Now I do. Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:12:42

Going to, The mint Chicago line in the other room, but

01:13:00

You know what? No, he's gonna be, he's gonna be different. He's gonna try and go through OG square through the mud. He stops right there cuz he cannot boom no way. Okay, Ochi and Grace. And you successfully bottlenecks these doors. Yeah. It's super. Super impressive. Oh, and this form is right here over there.

01:13:37

Oh, actually an accident. That, that ain't just like some well, not really but

01:13:49

Not that it gets any bonuses for any of this. So,

01:13:59

And then another one. Oh sorry. Take a negative two to that. I forgot to put that in who damage your hit a hit. Oh, it's still easily hits the swarm. It also has an included, my part, but whatever, whatever. I don't know. It's works out. It's fine, we fix it.

01:14:24

Man, you were just punching some fucking Ravens today. Ravens grabs one of the Ravens and then just looks at like the sky with the bone is like,

01:14:39

Another woman be going back. Invisible. This time Bo. Well, I could I guess I'll move a little closer.

01:14:57

Would stay. I would hit him with at the at the swarm without the furious snowballs. But there's a lot of people involved. Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:12

So what you want which character do

01:15:21

You know what, screw it. We're gonna do a scorching ray at the form, a single scorching, right? Nope. I do not have torching. My prefer today. Never mind, Probably through the one and said, how you snowball.

01:15:47

I will tell you, you will have better luck attacking up with a dagger.

01:15:57

Does still have swarm traits? Okay, I guess I'll get and I'll take back that felten.

01:16:09

You gotta like a burning hands or anything. Yeah, have a burning hands, but like I said, there's a lot of people involved.

01:16:21

If you blinked right here, you can fire it, I guess. Yeah, you're right. I could do this direction. And when I hit anyone Again? Yeah, I guess you're right. I'll go ahead and do that. I'm gonna go ahead and get my spot spot back real quick. Yes, Thank you.

01:16:38

Blinky an arcane point, a link.

01:16:49

And then based on

01:17:08

Completing his animation. Not working, don't know.

01:17:17

I think that might still finish it. It did.

01:17:26

The swarms are no more. What is that people? Why crap? But he is wrong for burning hams. It should be a DC-17 yourself. Look at certification. Yeah.

01:17:49

The blue.

01:17:56

I don't think you can do anything has to be a context change.

01:18:28

I mean, I guess. Yeah, I think you have to modify your evocation spells separately. Okay. I mean I guess I could have also just whacked him with my with my light mace. You did way more jail. Oh way more damage with the fire because it also doubled now. I think about it.

01:18:47

So it definitely killed it.

01:18:54

Anything else soil. Nope. That is it already that will bring us to Ochi's. Turn. Okay. I want to do something kind of fun. If we hate it, we don't have to do it because it involves a bunch of stupid math. But oh, she wants to take out a bag of Caltrops from his belt pouch and put them in the five foot square in front of him.

01:19:22

Okay, so we move to do it and then I imagine standard to spread them in a square. Is what I was gathering or I could throw them if I have to throw them in front of me, but I'm hoping that all of them have to step on that to come through that door expensive pounds.

01:19:43

It's annoying because it's like I think it's basically flat-footed for their AC against it just versus d20.

01:19:53

But yeah, I'd love the flavor of it. I've had like two or three bags of them for like, the whole game so far. No, you can use those fine. They deal a point of damage and then reduce movements if they get cow drop. So yes, that's not actually a whole lot of crazy.

01:20:12

Yeah, it's just for this attack creature shield armor, inflection bonuses. Do not count. I think that's basically just flat-footed or touch, right touch. AC. Yeah. Touch. Okay. I shielded enhancement bonuses.

01:20:33

Shield armor and deflection. So the deck still counts. It's kind of. It must have some fancy stuff going on. Either way, he spreads a bag in front of him and then takes a 5 foot step backwards, natural armor, but still count but they don't have it. Exactly. See. There we go.

01:20:56

And he steps. Back says, come on, come in. Yeah, touch is actually perfect for them.

01:21:07

I know that this is not the best move against ninja, but I don't think I'm ever gonna get another opportunity.

01:21:18

I mean, the cut that next Congo. White, exactly. I'm like, I'm never gonna get four dudes. Why lightning bolt for dudes lined up at a door again? No, but I do have a nice fully a snowballs.

01:21:40

You kill chops as old weapon.

01:21:49

Alcha boots. That's easy.

01:21:55

Are you looking for him? Yes, I can just throw you the text for Caltrops. You try to do like for throwing them or just how they no I was just looking for something with a attack button. For me to click but we can just roll it. They have base attack.

01:22:12

Bonus, zero is what the attack was for. So you could just roll a d20. I roll the d20. Oh, that'll be for this guy. It is not gonna hit the first round that he's in there. Yeah. Boom, way. And very more of those. I can't be right.

01:22:50

Three times a day, okay.

01:23:10

So he just sort of saunters by the door, it's just belches another god of flame.

01:23:28

And one of them actually failed to save. Do you guys have invasion? You don't. It's about sitting on. Unless there must be ninjas. Yeah, let's run fast ninja trick.

01:23:46

Okay, you still take half. You take full, you take cap.

01:24:06

Look Chaka is very unhappy that she was blind to just sort of states there. All right, this gentleman tries to go through the couch drops.

01:24:22

And they hit him. Hold on. So he takes one point of damage. I am fulfilled if they did something and movement speed is half. Now We're shoko. He could throw rocks at them now. Oh wow. So, he

01:24:49

Yeah, He steps into that square. And then steps back into this, one jumping up and down, pulling a cattle, drop out of his foot.

01:25:05

What the fuck are they been teaching? You that's in Discord. Is my reaction.

01:25:21

Oh, she just looks over a grace and it says, take your time.

01:25:32

Oh, gee with one.

01:25:42

The booms here is leaving the square. The Caltrops are in. Okay, takes a point of damage. As he cockily takes his fight, footstep forward and leaves with the Kaltrop in his foot. But unlike the other, dude, he is not giving up on life. He swings his Singham alochi and business.

01:26:16

That's right. Grayson gonna keep shooting at the ones further down, like,

01:26:38

Little film that you drops. And you see this guy oh, she's gonna pull slightly. Yeah. A folding table and serve sake to everyone else. While Grayson slowly kills all these guys before they can get to him. Yeah. These are the shitty ninja. They have an 8:15. So, even if I gave you a minus 6, cover bonus, you still would have hit it with that third arrow.

01:27:04

And I'm 550 at the end there and the center.

01:27:19

Well.

01:27:25

Well pump.

01:27:38

A bold. Take another point out fire damage.

01:27:46

This is beautiful. Someone decided the frozen shadow ninjas needed to be laid on fire.

01:27:59

We're leaving here with so many tracksuits. That I don't work. If you wear them under other things, I keep telling you fire is an arrow shots at your bow user. There's a 21 hit. I gotta check with my AC's. No, because I did the Burke skin. Nice. So a short bow arrow goes flying past you.

01:28:31

It hits Grayson and bounces off of him is so provision with the boat. At this point, he has become immune to arrow. He's just he's made of sterner stuff, man.

01:28:49

Oh well, now you are clearly in this guy's land of sight. There OG and he misses. No way. Your kid are not doing well. Oh, Raven is better than the ninjas. Anyway, so you guys have chosen death. That's not the cow drop square, right? It's where the cinders. It's on the other side of the door.

01:29:21

This is couch. It's only other side of the door. Wow. My man. He effectively plugged that doorway. Yeah, I'm seeing that. And frankly that the doorway down there is has a turret aimed at it. So, I'm just gonna hit some buttons. See what happens.

01:29:53

It's still alive. Unfortunately, they're still alive. Could be a sheep. That's true. He was serving. I'm going to move to there. Now, I'm gonna see if I can actually pull this off.

01:30:12

Zero pulls out a gun and does the curve. Bullet thing from that one movie, your main fire, your flurry of snowballs through Zeo where I am immune to the gold but they are immune to cold. I'll go there. I'll go there. Well, the Helgavalas, Welcome her ball. Yes, where he is an angel?

01:30:39

Why do people keep firing shit in my general direction? Is that This is a cone like spaced one space in front like that, Wouldn't it be one further back, Do I not know how these work? No, no, you're quite right here. Oh yeah, yeah. So I actually no I probably would I probably would have moved in front.

01:31:05

I'm happy to reflect it by. Just need to talk. Yeah, go ahead and be flex, that's what I thought.

01:31:16

Where's my reflexive? You can just hit this button. Connor. I mean, you can also be in the same squares held garble. I'm just gonna call him hell. Now I'll be in the same square. I don't care. Colony one, horrible. You would have made it anyway. But Yeah, but we've taken, boom, that ninja drops that Ninja drops.

01:31:47

When do remain. War garble Wireguard. And water. Okay, Well, you guys are too strong and ruined my plans. I was gonna be really terrible and just put down another bag of Caltrops and for the door.

01:32:18

But I think I'm gonna run in there and stab somebody. Yeah, we're gonna run in there and step somebody and go over your own cultraps. Yes. So, we'll get to there, we'll roll a D20. Do you want to roll it? Just you, Of course, they miss you. A bird feed protect you from the caltrops.

01:32:43

Yeah, I stand on just my tippy toes with my bird feet and then you make clicking like, you go. I overall acrobatics to get by the one boy.

01:32:56

And get somewhere like right about here and then do a stab.

01:33:12

I should also describe this room now that you're coming into it. By the way. Boom. That'll be cool. I did a successful. Stab that was like, my first one that wasn't on a bird today.

01:33:29

And sleeping palace lay neatly arranged about this at the foot of each of the small locker for personal belongings and an open iron trapdoor sits in the floor and near the east wall here.

01:33:52

Nice place. You got here, stab and did.

01:34:03

If I'm not mistaken, I get key points back for that, right? No, no, those are joke.

01:34:17

I am so like it's saving monkey surprise. The Caltrops. Hit like every one of them that tried to go through the door. These are terrible ninja. They just stomp around like complete. No heel toe at all. Just flat foot to the floor, actually embossed for them. I'm embarrassed. Oh, the monkey runs along the wall and then leaps at him and cuts a big old gash in him, but doesn't drop it.

01:35:06

Bookshaka year blinds per days.

01:35:14

But yeah, we're playing as prepared. She does not, But is not a single party, no pushaka still kind of hurt.

01:35:49

Move.

01:35:56

Elgarval thanks to just gonna sort of chill. Now, this seems this seems fairly wrapped up.

01:36:07

Did Grace's turn get skips it as I think it. Did you still would need to kill? Yeah, I tried to take a 5 foot step to go. Slightly better view on him. Very now. He has no cover bonuses.

01:36:29

And you're firing Quiero's through a burning fucking fire. It's super cinematic. And that dude gets Hawkeye to death.

01:36:42

Really neat visual in my head efficients like peering over there. He's kind of leaning to the left a little bit trying to see if there's any others that are gonna peak their head out of that doorway. Nope. Like I tell everybody dead. He's dead Grace Grace and Why aren't you showing your bed?

01:37:04

You're a negative 30 hit points like a little bit. Like he was still alive. Yeah. Why didn't he get the debt condition? Now, just salt. So here we go. So this gentleman only getting his or a standard is taking a move action.

01:37:35

Oh,

01:37:41

That's not good.

01:37:47

No way.

01:37:54

Where is the one last unfortunate? Dude. Like, he just went down a slide. There's a trapdoor in here and he just dove down it. Oh, did he? Oh, that's okay. So, I'm just going to use a full round action and light stuff. So, we're out of this leads to

01:38:27

Now, you don't look friend.

01:38:37

Charles Trolls. Shout So Trolls. That. Okay, now that means scroll down to the dungeons levels. Like you do a description of this room. Who this is the four.

01:39:00

Just oh, shit. No. Okay. You five. The coal seller. This room is oppressively hot compared to the rest of the sellers, not that, you know, that yet a culverness rotors in the far wall, giving the room stacked against the east wall and iron door opens in this feeling above the cold pit.

01:39:24

Three crude beds made of poorly cured bare, skins and wolf. Pelts have been thrown on the floor before the fire. Hog's head, rests between them next to the bloody bones of someone unfortunate creature. And yes, the two trolls look up from the board that it looks like they were eating.

01:39:45

Now, I just likes kicks. This one ninja in the back back lightly, just kind of like, that's your problem friend and then that's just

01:40:00

Oop, boom. Zeo, it's not hard to hear. It's not hard to hear the trolls echoing up from beneath the ground, the ground. I'm making. Now, let's check on trolls. You can which one I forgotten what it is. Let me back over to the Trolls. They are humanoids giant. So local.

01:40:29

I think I know trolls you know trolls fire antacid are your friends. Well, I got eight. Will eat you? Yeah. So he's gonna look like he's gonna go ahead and cast a nice. I'll get three images. I still can't go in your room, right? Okay, probably was my family.

01:41:00

Figure out how I can get myself. We'll find you something.

01:41:08

All right, use the other I haven't really figured out how to work that one yet, either. We'll you have three images. Okay, and that's pretty somewhat help. Held, I move into the room Of course walking over color. Cops purple. There's a lot of an inch touch AC. No, You are unaffected by the caltrops and they felt like, wait, right there and that's the end.

01:41:50

OTG you gotten go and then we are going to take our break here because I really need to be Gotcha. I'm gonna taste wearing away and the ninja went Egypt down the suit. Shoot.

01:42:07

Oh, Boys from next to you Trolls.

01:42:18

And it's only you. And this ninja visible make and acrobatical for me, by the way, the two of you

01:42:34

He did not. These are the stealth titties like fill out with their bottom. Okay, you know, might looks and what's in the back? You two are fine. You a light with the biggest of ease, like a dumb feather floating in the TH room. Yeah, I'm interesting. Right Cute. It's red big thing.

01:43:00

No. It said yeah, it'll come in handy and have you? Yeah.

01:43:14

We can take it all offer before company returns. Because are just

02:00:08

I am back with a soda instead of trying to make another cup of tea. There enough. All ready? I would just listening to some music. Oh, gee. Yes. You dropped on the shoot? I will let you do the 10 feet of movement if you'd like.

02:00:41

Okay, I'm going to move.

02:00:53

340 feet, apparently.

02:00:58

It won't let. There we go. That one space I'll move right there. And back to a lot of movement.

02:01:10

And so I can still swing. Yeah. Who you get within reach of the ninja unless he's invisible. Oh yeah. No. You can you can swing on the pro ninja if you'd like from. Oh,

02:01:30

He dies.

02:01:35

And then I begin crying.

02:01:41

I mean you should because the trolls were gonna kill him. First, I wasn't sure.

02:01:52

Being controls. Look what we got here, tasty, little bird.

02:02:21

Only two hit you. He gets me 9.6 damage. That feels good you chucker I'm sorry I'm just gonna have through those comment but

02:02:38

Oh yeah. Loose.

02:02:53

Bum and 900 feet. Oh, you're just right there.

02:03:12

A smooth 10 feet.

02:03:18

He sings all the claw. That's a miss Prison.

02:03:32

A little unsure about just leaving Luke Chaka here by herself blind.

02:03:45

Um, maybe he'll go to the top of the shoots and look down and see if he could see. Whatever is going on down below to like try to shoot from above still hide behind this curtain. So, you guys don't have to worry about, okay?

02:04:16

There we go.

02:04:23

And then is there a and the Royal I need to make to land on my feet dramatics. Please.

02:04:35

Or.

02:04:40

You're good. I'll take one shot. It's on the one who's literally looming over you. Sorry, I saw the school on top of them, but I see the now that that's a different person. Okay. Yeah. Against the, the one, right? And ninja.

02:05:07

Also, I super dig the new troll artwork. They're fine. They're they're beautiful That looks bore. Like yeah, it does. Look, definitely look like they're running on all fours.

02:05:28

This big green bores much larger amounts.

02:05:36

What's going on down here? I controlled flight down. Oh god.

02:05:49

Throw the channel ninja died. Bringing its noise turn. Mm-hmm. And it sure is. It sure is. Um, which one do I want to?

02:06:15

Take one Mikey swing.

02:06:21

None of, that's two for flanking.

02:06:33

Minus 3 to its natural armor and it's second and it's bleeding for. As long as it's dating which is until presumably, it's done. If these are normal trials.

02:06:48

They are.

02:07:00

Anything else? I would love to tell you. Yes, but no Rio, I will kind of, you know, move over

02:07:14

That's terrifying. Oh no, I didn't hear Acrobatics, I guess to land at my feet. Correct for these, you're good.

02:07:32

Little jarring with your good. I'm sorry to wait.

02:07:40

Oh no, she's over here. She was clear. No, I'm talking a what about to do?

02:08:00

I don't know which I guess. Oh, I could work the

02:08:13

I want to find a little burning hand on it. One. Good thing to do it. That wouldn't barbecue. No way, I would probably say here would be the best place to do it.

02:08:33

Okay. Okay, if you can eventually cast the yes. Yeah, I will defensive cap. I'm gonna get that impact. That is correct.

02:08:49

Yeah, I think I got here. Good.

02:09:01

Yeah, after this one slightly meta, no, he's just gonna be like, alright, I'm picking up a vision next level.

02:09:18

Ruining hands. Why are you broken?

02:09:27

Did I even hit the other one? But you welcome. You can put call. Yeah. Yeah. You hit both of them and miss. No way. The 15 foot goes. Okay, perfectly right there. Okay, So TC17 reflex

02:09:53

Well, the top one doesn't make it. He is not expecting that.

02:10:00

You know.

02:10:07

Back.

02:10:21

Already and that is the end of my turn.

02:10:28

And ochi. Yes. So How are they looking Have? We this homie is super fucked up and he has taken fire damage. So his regeneration. Not active currently perfect. Okay, so I'm going to take a swing on really hurt guy, two swings.

02:11:05

If so much fun.

02:11:14

Am I flanking with no way right now? No. Now, sorry, I had the menu over where I was at. Sorry, technically, I'm fucking with no way that is true.

02:11:38

Anyth. I do have my trusty makes out. Oh, staggered.

02:11:46

Is it exactly zero after the first two attacks until he bleeds that one. This time, your point is valid.

02:12:01

And that was Ochi's. Turn way in certain he's scrambles on top of the Arcadence head.

02:12:20

He gets from that. Look up, really, okay. But you're fine and does the exact same thing to fit.

02:12:33

But they both make it for him. Boom. Bringing us to this trolls turn.

02:12:47

And he thinks three bleed still alive.

02:12:59

Technically unconscious. But still good.

02:13:11

You know anything about trolls. You have zero knowledge, local. That's a no ochy took a hit.

02:13:29

Here. Boop 13 points. Appealing to OG.

02:13:39

Korea with those ones. Oh yeah. With those one. Did you feel like she? I did not apply. I couldn't apply it though. I, I just want to make sure we didn't double up because I was about to click it. The boom. It doesn't do like collect discounts on healing.

02:14:02

That sounds different.

02:14:09

A single by negative OG asking for a friend, He's the friend that's a mess. If the bread and then full clar attack, still missing All Mrs. Grayson crystal wall, take the shots at the the further troll.

02:14:38

That is the packet. He's also not looking good and yeah, that's it.

02:14:58

Hit me.

02:15:11

That's why it's weird. I have a tax setup as an attack, not a breath weapon that later.

02:15:23

Well really trolls? Okay. I will one can't make the reflex safe that they're both gonna take full damage. He's been negative, 19. He used to think four more damp.

02:15:43

No way. Mmm. Okay, but this one still standing. He is still standing. Yes, five foot step drawing my other lockers action fine way. Okay, okay. First one.

02:16:15

He also drops still, pretty solid on. HBO is a, nope, he is dead and decapitated.

02:16:30

And I'm like this thing. I'm at negative 31. Yeah, use is done.

02:16:42

I don't like you since. Wow. Here, there's gonna say thousand. So he's gonna pull that. Nice. Trusty May 30th, he's got out with him, you know, maybe find me. He's gonna attempt to create graph. All right, okay.

02:17:07

You for more damage. Kill him. Okay. I'll just do this. He did he did completely

02:17:21

Congratulations. You guys handled the surprise trolls. Quite well. I don't like surprise trolls. How do I unsubscribe?

02:17:35

That was certainly something good job Is everyone. All right.

02:17:47

Oh, she's gonna a little startled, but fine. Oh, she's gonna say a prayer over them. And for the Tengu and the frozen shadow ninja regular people above, You just cannot say thanking honest, I'm even more worried for a mako than I was before. After this, we should continue. I would be Come on everyone.

02:18:13

Either way you guys didn't do it. But the interior of the furnace in here deals, 66 points of fire damage each round anyone inside. So they gave you a way to get rid of. The trolls is is knocked them unconscious and throw them into the first nice.

02:18:35

Make sense. What do we see down this here hallway? I need a perception check from you guys before you get too far away from the coal pay actually, oh yeah, sure.

02:18:52

Hell. Yeah, dude.

02:19:04

Like,

02:19:09

Gonna refresh. So you see buried kind of haphazardously under a layer of coal and not like deep into the coal. It's only like a layer because they're trolls and they're not, particularly clever. I you see a bag going to assume. It's in a bag. Yes. Okay. And inside that bag appears to be gold arm rings, and another small sack of amethyst.

02:19:48

Oh but these arm rings by any chance, have a particular iconography on it. No, he's snoring that it's still nice. Mmm. Oh, she's gonna say a prayer for them, too. You keep praying like that. The gods might actually listen and that's not a typo. That is 50 amethyst cheese.

02:20:18

Okay, that's a lot. So what about down this hallway? I see. Like some water. Is there a little stream? Please, let me I just finished reloading d4. This hallway actually has its own description. Good Blooded. Passage a deep channel of flowing water crosses. The hall here on the opposite side lies, a heavy timber plank of brass, bell, and Clapper hanging from the wall on this side of the stream.

02:20:54

And hold on. I actually you measure something.

02:21:05

You're just in range. Oh boy. Ochi within a moment of you stepping into this place, you feel the presence of another mind reach out and touch your own. I word the mind is our full and regal and old. Oh, Wow, that's cool. I am a Tatsu, that's me. Come to retrieve me from this place of darkness.

02:21:40

Yes, you are close. Now, They have cast me into some sort of dark pit seek me out. Do they have a mako? Are you have you seen her? Is she alive?

02:22:01

I assume this is the I'm a Tatsu, you serve? Yes, I have not touched her mind in this place. They've captured her and I hope they're holding her here.

02:22:19

We will need your help and it, if nobody else can, that's hilarious. Hear that or know that? Yeah, he's gonna say. I hear the voice the sword. I think the sword is here and it's talking to me. It, How hard did you get hit by the troll? Take you just grabs, he grabs.

02:22:45

No way and pulls her like four steps forward.

02:22:55

There are multiple scions. Oh, okay. That's unnerving. It is good to see the rise of the Amit Hudson's. Once more.

02:23:11

Well, that's what we're here to make sure happens. And so can you describe one more time for me, what the apparatus is that we're seeing on one side or other side of the channel here because I my brain shut off.

02:23:31

Four. It's a deep channel of flowing, water to crosses the hull here on the opposite side. But you actually came down the wrong side. So on this side where you are now, normally you would be on this side, you see, a brass Bell, a heavy timber plank. And a clapper though, that is a heavy timber plank that can be placed over the rushing water for easy accents.

02:24:02

Oh my gosh. Oh this is to like keep the skip because you're supposed to come from this direction. Normally. Yeah, This keeps happening in my games. Why?

02:24:22

Well, which way do you think we should go? The sword. I believe is, is this way? I think it would be very helpful.

02:24:33

Certainly so long as we're not going to get jumped by any further things this time around Other than the street down here, they only exit is what that door. Yeah, which I'm in just to cover our bases. Presumably while someone deals with either getting across that thing or something.

02:24:54

I guess. No. I will have a good look at the door. Is it going to explode?

02:25:04

It is not Cool. That's not have any traps on it, okay? But it is in fact, what

02:25:20

29 Tech time says, it is Quest hoping it's not a 30.

02:25:38

It is not. It is a 25 click, I mean, unlock that for you.

02:25:49

Now, what do you have locked up? Probably the trolls judging on this channel here, and the locked door. I would be the sensible. Ask Unfortunately, I'm not sensible, So unless you stop her. She's gonna open the door. Yeah. Go ahead for a peek. Let's see what's that way. Before we go the other way.

02:26:18

The ceiling of this Grand Chamber. Rises. 20 feet overhead. It's heavy beam serving as both Raptors and supports for the great hall above. Zeke paneling covers the walls in the floors of polished wood, Along the walls, wooden columns, rise. The ceiling above bearing banners and blazon with pictograms, far out, Tianzia above these hangs, small oil lamps.

02:26:42

That give up a dim glow. A small, porcelain bowl rests before the center column to the south and four read mats our arranged before it. I think we go this way. I suspect this might be their equivalent to the dojo. Oh, she steps in keyless. Birdbrained, of course, you do Ouachi.

02:27:13

That's why we like you.

02:27:20

But I actually have to adjust people's positions on the maps because you guys got down here without raising an alarm.

02:27:38

And all without a single stealth rule. Well, I would have done but, you know, You don't have to be sneaky. If everyone's dead, the jumping down, the chute is not something. I think they expect you to do. Well, we didn't want the guy to obviously, run out here, like, raise the alarm and fight the whole place at once.

02:27:59

That was the the World of Warcraft, run away, the fear and pulled more mobs. Yeah. You.

02:28:11

All right, you may resume your moving. Okay. Well, I'm gonna nosy nosy. Well, everyone else is kind of walking forward. I'm gonna check some doors, so I'm going to serendiply.

02:28:31

See if I just checks for doing. So let me still check. I also succeed that but I will probably want. Anyway, that's fair. All right. Yeah, you see this guy in there, meditating.

02:28:59

Hmm.

02:29:05

He looks like he's in an action fighting game familiar. He might be, I'm not.

02:29:19

He does not seem to have noticed you.

02:29:28

I'm gonna do the ninja thing, unless you stop me, but you haven't said anything to us. And if you say anything to us, then we lose the surprise. So, it's really your ball. Point example. Just creeps up pulls out weapon. You have to open the door more than the crack.

02:29:49

Did you do that? Come on though, I'm gonna give him this.

02:29:59

You are my fire. You are fine. You get to them and you get your surprise around.

02:30:16

And I wonder why this realized you were getting a plus four on that. And then, yes, circumstances for it being in dim light because he's human, but it's just yeah. Sorry buddy. My one more a dip. It. And actually you guys wouldn't know or see this. So, I'm not concerned about doing this, a key point to do a different thing as well.

02:30:47

So one, two, three.

02:31:01

Really I really just thought? No, look. Do I?

02:31:15

Wow. No. You don't? Yeah, whatever. Sure. She makes his sonic boom swinging. So hard right over his head. Can't do the cool ninja thing because fuck me, I guess. Okay, cool. Well, you might be able to because now we will do this.

02:31:38

And if you go before him, you'll still do the cool ninja thing.

02:31:45

Yeah, barely. Oh my god. Fuck me to be fair. These are only Annie's best students and you would know that. Yeah, that's kind of why I wanted to take them up. I'm just not deal with it.

02:32:05

But it was a surprise around and this is my actual round. Does that mean I get my full attack? It does mean you get your pool attack because he is not acted yet, so he is still flat-footed against you. Oh yeah, I'll roll for native now. Even if I yes but not for this round.

02:32:37

I'll go ahead and roll my knit up.

02:33:16

All right, no way make here deck.

02:33:26

Of course, that's the one where I recoil of, okay.

02:33:32

This you have any way to add three's of that. I fucking wish if I did not want is Blackfooted? AC is 14. Yeah. Well, there is a really fucked up wall next time.

02:33:52

Food. Oh, none for the matters. You're second attack actually just drops him. Yeah. And as that attack hits, there's those this feedback force and Yeah. Wow. And,

02:34:14

To get a turn. So he ain't get to call out to anyone.

02:34:29

Won't you?

02:34:36

What a shame and Chris, he's gonna go stealthily, open the disc door. So, here we go in. This room has the gear come from right three, jade raven, statuettes.

02:35:09

Masterwork spear and units proper plus one. So, there's sometimes two

02:35:33

To confoon. So you see, you see like no I briefly on the side of your eyes, you vanishes and then comes back and it's just head to pearl. Basically covered in blood. It's in. You got a 21 on your sales check? Yep. I roll the two, you know, that's unfortunate.

02:35:58

You should have a master's here. Masterworks. That's not mess words. Short spears. So just fear. Yes, it's the master sphere from the not often played spin-off legends of Zelda.

02:36:27

Virgin. Oh yes. He seems much more aware than the last guy.

02:36:37

Grayson really initiative for me.

02:36:49

All right, you get a surprise room, you get a standard action or move action.

02:36:58

Will just shoot.

02:37:07

Boom that hits but does not drop in. All right, everyone else. Please join us initiative.

02:37:24

That I don't have any templates to measure.

02:37:42

Getting bother rolling these ones.

02:37:50

Maybe you'll live.

02:37:56

Leo.

02:38:01

Supposed to talking as a reaction, isn't it? Yep. Yep. He shouts an alarm Zeo, yo, zero pretty much. Look at the weather four doors that are in here. And like One of those first stores that opened, they're gonna get somebody hit with magic missile.

02:38:25

Like, all right. He has in his hand for one of magic missile. All right. So you're ready to cancel the spell of the person? I'm easy. Yeah, very good. Grayson. Will attempt to finish them off.

02:38:51

Amongst.

02:38:57

Boom. He never got to act or die.

02:39:11

Open. Boom, door, open, seo, fiery missile, no problem. Boom. He gets battered with them.

02:39:35

A boom. And,

02:39:41

How far out are you in the second range increment? So, -2 dual attack girls' spirit. You you with probably wrong. Oh Koya said on that and then used to be there. Oops.

02:40:08

And I remember to move her.

02:40:19

We'll say quoias turn was moving into the room.

02:40:34

Monk, open this door. Doesn't really see anything from there to step out.

02:40:54

And oh no, he's visible. Currently curses head to toe in blood and probably spitting out a bit of it too. That's what have a spear. Nope, What was Sensei doing with you?

02:41:20

And,

02:41:34

Little where I want you to move.

02:41:45

Rose and Spear. He's crazy, guys. Come on.

02:41:56

Like the spider eater was more dangerous than everything inside.

02:42:11

I mean, I guess technically wouldn't wearing still be on the old's head. Oh no. He was probably still bullying around with okay girl, but no way, cool, cool charge.

02:42:35

Did it?

02:42:42

Might burn my dice.

02:42:47

They are digital. So that could prove difficult, I'd like to do it, You charge, right? I did that includes the charge bonus. Oh, it does. Okay. Yeah.

02:43:16

It.

02:43:25

Your movement is still green. Oh, because you're a monk.

02:43:45

But in that work.

02:43:55

Big second one. Then I don't think either those hit. No, Actually no. I I think it did and putting the blinking about it is an 18. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. You're right? Yeah, yeah. For yep. You right. So yeah, you clock up. This dude comes spinning out of his weird dojo room and delivers a spinning kick.

02:44:29

You know, why? They're all Bruce Lee. Now, in my head, I'm gonna leave you in so many pieces.

02:44:41

He's so fast.

02:44:47

Okay. That's the end. Was moving. Sweet whoochy. Seeing the way. Get ganged up on, he's gonna run up and do some stabbing.

02:45:10

And he will do one on this chain flaking line.

02:45:34

And that's going to be it for right now only 11 damage. I was like I thought I was 26 damage.

02:45:46

Excellent. Work Zeo.

02:45:54

I'm gonna look at the one. That's right. You know. Swing. A throw scare me, which is this one here.

02:46:10

I'm gonna go ahead and love a nice snowball at it.

02:46:24

And he will non-shot lane just like move forward.

02:46:48

Just the one person there, huh.

02:47:00

Well, I am moves up here. Gonna pass through the knife at that dude.

02:47:09

And well that would technically be a hit and they move very similar to only Annies. He knocks it aside but unlike an arrow hurts, our knife flies back into her hand. Grayson. Hey, you know this guy just used up as to play there? Sure to, or it was like advantage of that, it was around.

02:47:39

Yeah. Oh wow. He says, correct no because he already used it for the round. Those first two arrows. Kill him. Um, lose your next target for that third arrow. We'll go to the this one, the one down here. I mean, I'm gonna recommend you throw it at one of the full health like this, dude, because they only have 2983.

02:48:13

Yeah, but they're just gonna catch it. Oh, that's fair. They haven't used thirds like there of they have they? Yeah. So it doesn't really matter who I shoot it at this point. It really hurts his hand. It does the fourth required to deflect. That arrow is insane. Their hand is forever changed in the sorted.

02:48:42

Oh, you stuck out the dead. Let's go on him.

02:48:51

Here we go. Anyway, the time

02:48:58

Symbol.

02:49:11

So confused, whatever. It's tiny school now.

02:49:22

Already.

02:49:31

One step here here.

02:49:39

It cannot blurry. He will just stab. Yep.

02:49:54

You. Okay.

02:53:28

And amongst with the vision completely dodges fire. Oh, gee

02:53:36

Oh, gee

02:53:41

It's gonna do some nonsense.

02:53:51

I'm gonna go there.

02:53:59

All right, i mean accuratic check. Oh, that's not as high as I thought it would be and not as high as you needed. Oh boy or they are fourth level monks.

02:54:21

Boom. Okay, this guy. Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on. Hold on. One second.

02:54:33

How far is that? I don't think I have the speed to even do that. Anyways. So, if I'm doing it with Acrobatics, you would have 20 feet to do that. Yeah, No. I mean, if you just provoke anyway, and work either way, the Europe 25 speed when you're moving acrobatically.

02:55:04

Space Party, 15. He's when you move the space bar, does the turns?

02:55:17

I think it's different for the measure tool, but

02:55:23

Playing not working. Like, none of the buttons are working on it.

02:55:32

So 15.

02:55:42

Okay. On 15, you go there. 25. That was suffice. I guess they don't stop me. They just hit me, right? That is correct because you're not going through their space. Yeah. Okay. And technically you won't promote from him because you're stopping here. Okay. Well, learn bash me one. Beer attack coming your way.

02:56:17

Four points of damage. I'll do it. Are either of these untouched, One of them is, yes. Actually this gentleman, I will challenge that guy. I'll say someone. Why don't you try me? He's alive. Try me quite a sword. Adam.

02:56:40

So and then he'll take a swing on him.

02:57:06

That's all I got.

02:57:13

That will not be an updated unfortunately. Okay. So what is your challenge due to them? Mechanically, it doesn't do anything to them. It's just I take a minus to AC against other targets and I get more damage. Okay, of the round. Then zeo, he will proceed to beat the guy up with his mace.

02:57:46

And buddy with

02:57:51

The boom.

02:57:57

And the end of different.

02:58:02

Gonna come right here.

02:58:08

And continue 11 points of healing to Norway. Yeah. So some of the blood dries up and then start spilling again and just like recuts Jason. I appreciate you. Trying crystal shouldn't the one that's in front or right next to Zeo.

02:58:37

Of course, it's the first era. I'm you know what, You know what, those few natural twenties. I'm gonna say his deflect, arrow does it for him. It goes through his hand. I don't normally use death crate rules, but that was nice. Very nice and that I'm gonna assume the other arrows aren't gonna hit anybody with those roles.

02:59:12

That's it. Unfortunately, that boom. Who started this? Dude's turn. Um, What is their morale? Oh, the disciplined monks, have sworn themselves, completely to the frozen shadow and fights death, got it. Boom. Ochi.

02:59:44

Yours isn't working either.

02:59:51

Those than something terrible rules. They don't hit, yeah.

03:00:02

Hey, no way. Attacking with Larry Bose. Yep. And no.

03:00:21

That dude is very, very, very, very good.

03:00:59

Not even looking again but no way. Okay, for footsteps down and this this guy,

03:01:14

That's two for lightning.

03:01:23

Wow.

03:01:33

That's a thing. I'm gonna go grab a drink. You guys can couldn't keep going. I'll be right. Itchy. I feel like I just went.

03:01:51

Well, the numbers numbers have dwindled. Okay I'll swing on the same one that I swung on last time, twice the one with more health I believe. It's that one.

03:02:18

Of course. Well, whipping going on in this fight.

03:02:26

Feel like Grayson has murdered everyone because he has. Yep, that's my turn. Video.

03:02:44

Why you still showing double buffs? At least one of the entire courage is gone. Oh no. It's not we can have a double buff. No, Grayson is double buff but we don't actually have someone giving you inspired courage right now. So double up is still there.

03:03:13

So zoom will look at this point here and without wand of magic missile. Here we go, ahead and more force.

03:03:31

He drops.

03:03:36

And the individual turn.

03:03:40

It really been a lot of damage going around, then there.

03:03:55

Here you exclude them. I will channel energy, everyone.

03:04:12

Great thin. Oh, are the mayonnaise expected to have the most trouble than this site? Well, Well, shoot the last one that I see that's a lot. I guess to those three attacks around. How would you have them first time? Because they have just like Darrows like this. And then none of his attacks headed.

03:04:36

Oh no. He has two attacks.

03:04:42

Oh good. The Keisha. Clear of those. Oh no. Right now it's it's three arrows. Normally, I'm not even using no this story, but even if you take into account snapchatters, you still have to attack everyone. That's true and three. If you keep right, you all right?

03:05:06

Through food, you're dead off my checker, the one who's still alive.

03:05:20

We're gonna call him. The Second greatest of vomiani students is going to keep trying to kill the first one. Doing a pretty good job, all things, consider

03:05:40

Way in.

03:05:50

Finally, run up under him lump for the fight of him.

03:06:06

Takes one non-level.

03:06:12

No way. Well, I'm pretty sure brands isn't large enough to consider clunking. I don't know. It's not, he's tiny. Yeah, that's bad. It was fine.

03:06:30

As well. This is a cholesterol I can do this.

03:06:40

That's about right.

03:06:50

As is that?

03:06:56

Words.

03:07:01

But,

03:07:05

Can you literally do anything else? But,

03:07:19

Sort of I guess perfect memory.

03:07:26

Bless her protective aura, but he has to be worn for that.

03:07:34

He can do this.

03:07:46

And you get four, temporary treat and a plus one morale bonus on attack rules.

03:07:55

A white bonus one more. I'll benefit attack rolls and saves against fear effects. Gotcha, I think there's an aid bub in the competium.

03:08:09

And then it is your turn. Oh, and that room has its you different description, as well.

03:08:32

Does the casser. Level affect it at the level. We're at only for the amount of time. Okay, cool.

03:08:46

So With that, turned on, he's gonna five foot step up amber. This guy.

03:09:03

Blinking.

03:09:15

Both of those hit but he is still going. I hate it here.

03:09:25

Oh, no one thought taking on a ninja portrait would be easier, right? No. Anything else when you turn? No sorry. That'll be it zo.

03:09:47

Look at him, I target him. And like why do your thing you're one botched but it can't really bunch

03:10:05

Now, the thrill of that interesting combat has ended, no way. You recognize the lacquered screen in this room as the meditation screen that only Yanni used some meditate behind.

03:10:23

He's green itself is worth 200 gold pieces and it's obviously a Tian Ming style. Behind the screen is a small leather trunk in which are kept a washer woman's clothes and other possessions, including a disguise kit, an ornate, blowgun fashion from Jade and lapis. Lazuli not usable as the weapon but worth 200 gold as an art object, 150 gold pieces in Tian coins and a Rit signed by Sven blood eagle.

03:10:54

That gives the bear the authority to commandeer any of the norm kings housecarled within two miles of cows guard for up to 12 hours that onlyani saves for emergencies,

03:11:10

Yeah. Do what you want with it. Take it. Burn it. I I don't care. Fun stuff. Oh, Chico and do his prayer. Christian goes around and like, loots. The various rooms, you find a total of one, two, three, four, five, six, masterwork spears. And,

03:11:43

So five more masterwork screen. I'm just gonna put the the total amount into this chord.

03:11:57

Far.

03:12:02

Oh, dear God. I can actually use a sphere. Favorites, always build it wrong.

03:12:18

Let's go and then

03:12:25

Really, that's it. Oh, I guess only Yanni was supposed to be the final boss in this room.

03:12:33

That would make sense. Assuming you didn't kill her and heard initial attacks.

03:12:48

And then this room is actually, otherwise empty, you guys don't mind if you takes something and I'm not tolerant to you. No, no. I mean there's enough there for everyone to get one.

03:13:11

Yeah, Grayson's gonna take one too.

03:13:19

Can't think of our skin would would overshadow it. He doesn't always have that actually.

03:13:33

Well, that was the thrilling.

03:13:50

Let's be on our way.

03:13:54

I guess going down the other way that we originally going to go to. Yes, just to be thorough. Grayson is going to search the room. That was clearly umayani's for like a secret passage.

03:14:14

But you find anything of the sort in that room.

03:14:23

I have no a help me put the board across the thingy. You need, you get across the rushing waters with ease.

03:14:35

Assuming you don't mind balancing too much.

03:14:44

Water shame, that would be.

03:15:05

Do we hear anything in particular from either of these tools? I mean, we know you hear the sound of water coming from this direction. I think that. Yeah, we want to go this way because this is where we could tell the sword was. That is the door locked. Can I just try it or sorry?

03:15:21

Let's back up. Hold up. I want to see if it's trapped.

03:15:31

They want a second opinion. Oh, she says I don't think it's trapped and he tries the door. Oh,

03:15:46

Check this out, likely for you. It's not trapped. Let me get back up to D2 but there are opens into a natural cavern 30 feet across and 15 feet high. A waterfall. Pours in through a small aperture, high on the south wall, filling a turbulent pool in the floor and sending a cold spray throughout the room.

03:16:09

A smooth ledge extends outward from the door and two large barrels have been set to the right of it. Another ledge sits on the far side of the pool, a smaller cask sits fullness ledge next to a heavy wooden door.

03:16:28

Just a bunch of barrels, casks. Over there.

03:16:44

Do I notice anything strange about the water? Nope, just looks like natural spring water and how high above the water. Are these ledges?

03:16:56

Not too far like maybe the few inches. Okay cool. I'm gonna swim across guys. I want to check this out. Oh no. I walks across. God damn it.

03:17:16

Wet. And you think that like Yep I can move down my speed as a full round action that can go over difficult terrain water been branches. What problem you? It's just cold. It doesn't look like anything. It's in the barrels at the front of the room but the cask next to the other door is sealed and holds an unfamiliar and potent alcohol.

03:17:49

Oh that's not unfamiliar, it's sake from Minkai. Oh, hell yeah, it is a door. Look trap. That's for Gillum sits. Atop the tap, the cask.

03:18:09

Motivated as per gallon.

03:18:18

Yeah, weapon. It is it usually holds. Holy water are. Yeah, no way. Can you take a look at this door? Oh, you want my opinion now? Yeah, sure. White's like takes up, glasses wipes, like a layer of the blood. That was spilling from our forehead and has a look at it.

03:18:45

And it's not trapped. It is most definitely blocks though, and the 29 on that. I was literally just looking at the block.

03:19:15

It's E25. Pops open.

03:19:25

This room is small and musty Hewn from solid rock near the far wall, stands a low. Well it's opening only a foot in diameter a winch and chain with a rusted steel bucket. Hang from the wall above it. The far corners. It's a pile of old wooden buckets and other debris, rotten broken with several different kinds of fungi growing on their remnant.

03:19:53

How toxic are those and how quickly am I going to die from breathing? This thorosin, not that kind of fungus and disappointed. One importantly, looks down this. Well, tries to the squins a bits. It gets very bright further down the well as a katana wedge into this tiny asshole of lights with gold and red flames.

03:20:22

Oh cheese. White and gold. Yeah way.

03:20:39

This is actually important.

03:20:59

It's kind of like orangey gold flames. Hmm, How did you say this was about like a foot diameter. Oh, but yeah. Well, that would be incredibly problematic if right. There you are. I'm retrieving and a will come around one of those down a. Well honestly, who's my goodness. Apparently Google.

03:21:33

Let's complain and more going to fucking gets the book. He claims easily done the well.

03:21:57

Inside up for this. So, very slowly because

03:22:09

This is actually really heavy for him.

03:22:19

Yeah, his push drag is 50 pounds. How broken light heavy? It's like regular katana. Heavy six pounds. So it's it's almost at his lift above head weight and he's kind of got a lift above head. Push not drag. Okay? Okay. I'm hearing a lot of complaints and what I'm actually needing to hear is how far down is it?

03:22:51

Because if you can't pull it, we have this wonderful Fandangled invention, year called rule, I'm getting it. Oh well, why didn't you just send a rope down? Because it was funny funnier to see you get after it. I asked question, even the one who went into this. He me the room time.

03:23:17

We throw it all down to him. Okay, goes through a bag. Pulls up. And last year, is the end of it and hand it. Filing up complaints. With the heavenly Bureau fear. I well, the heavenly bureaucracy can talk in ways until we've gotten back our sail and I would tug on the rope after a minute.

03:23:47

That. And yeah you guys pull out blah ocean endlessly. Excuse me, it's changed. Where did you go? There you are. If we were home.

03:24:13

So this beautiful blade made an ancient Tian style, has both a scabbard and that's so basic looking. I think that makes sense. I it is almost beautiful and its simplicity. It's scabbard is black and glossy and still in perfect condition. And the wrapped handle appears to be made of some form of leather.

03:24:42

That you're not familiar with and the gold. Accoutrement are shining sill.

03:24:53

Fancy that's rings. A cloth out. Whips off. Whatever dust and gumkit managed to get on old adapter. Archie, you're free my friend and he grabbed out of the vomitasu. Very have my thanks for the rest. It is good. Now, that this plan has finally come to fruition, as I foresaw,

03:25:25

They did not foresee the only stealing me before your it's concerned. They've been very hard at work with a concern, you to learn that. They also have our Scions somewhere around here.

03:25:44

It does greatly it. That's the like, literally just drops the sword unless he capture that. And then just what I stand is. Like I said, I grab a gingerly. Well, no no. I said I grabbed it, I grab it and tuck it into like the back of my belt, my little OB.

03:26:09

You can come with me. So here's fun thing. Solution is a plus two defending flaming katana. The endcircle blade of the Amitatsu family and switching can be wielded by any amatatou scion. You don't just have to be a natural ward dependent. You will allow someone who acts in defense of the throne to wield it as well.

03:26:36

You hear that? Grayson. That could be fun. Flurry of katana, Although solution is neutral. Good, any amatatou style. Regardless of the Lightning can Falconing and negative level. This boon is at their discretion. However, and should such a Scion ever betrayed the family or prove. Unworthy. The sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict and because this is an artifact lightly take over your body.

03:27:13

Oh hell yeah. There you go ego. He actually he doesn't have a very high. You go only 25 that is actually a pretty high ego.

03:27:32

Oh neat. You don't need to know that. I don't think any of you are going to try and destroy this sword. I don't think so, don't something to me.

03:27:50

Well.

03:27:55

I loaded the sword in. Thank you way on.

03:28:05

Yeah, buddy. You know, the Amitatsues. Why are you there? What just happened. I was trying to import you into the game waiting. How do I remove you? There we go.

03:28:29

And,

03:28:36

So this might be a little bit of a fine detail. Does does Zeo know anything about what we're talking about with scions and such because he wasn't there. When the the seal was opened and we were made into Scions, he does not We've just been and the seal has not been opened again.

03:28:58

He's kind of like thinking what's what the hell they talking about. He also can't hear the sword. So, that whole conversation, you guys just was just us talking to a sword while he stands behind us, Though. He might think you're all crazy.

03:29:20

I think is a little late for thinking whether or not we are crazy. And potentially just receiving confirmation at this point.

03:29:32

So, if I understanding this floor plan correctly, they expect you to go from wherever I'm stood. Presumably down that way with water is or to go up to where the dojo is.

03:29:54

Which won't be honest. I'm going this way. Think somewhere here, just organic sled me.

03:30:07

You didn't realize yeah, the answer is now though.

03:30:20

Let's drop is a lot. Is it anything? It is that and now it's scroll back all the way up there.

03:30:34

Do you want? Just love how OG? Just kidding me. Moving forward. Yep. Boom. The stairs to send into a plain room of mortared. Stone walls, drip, with convincation giving the air a cold claimy feel, but you were supposed to be coming down the stairs over here.

03:31:05

Looks head back up, shall we?

03:31:26

Don't suppose the sword had the pleasure of knowing what the rest of this down place. Looks like when it was brought down here. You guys got shunted into the way wrong spot. Hold on.

03:31:42

Wow. This is a nice trip that I might token. Just went on that. I got the view a lot of stuff up.

03:31:51

You're supposed to teleport there. Not be dragged.

03:32:02

I'm gonna put everyone in this space.

03:32:10

You this direction. So, I don't accidentally throw you. Rough map by dragging you through the token again like I just did for him.

03:32:25

Rule see.

03:32:37

All right. Now, you may resume you reach this landing with the door.

03:32:53

But I hope I open the door, the 13, Is the laboratory This room has been hewn from the rock of the Crag and a wooden stare rises along the walls, able some workbenches filled with chamber, holding all matter of Olymp Olympic Crucibels, burners, and assorted tools, as well, as a large glass case, holding one appears via humanoid body.

03:33:26

A variety of dried herbs and plants dingle and perfusion from hooks in the bottom of bears and sex and chests. Hold additional equipment and components and have been shoved underneath the stairs. A torch mounted on one of the stairs stair pose illuminates. The chamber with a flickering glow, is this where they made you no way.

03:33:52

She gives you a look as, if to contradict you and then goes.

03:34:08

I mean, I'll I'll happily do do like a perception trick with the skim for anything of particular interest because laboratory laboratory is cool. I think there's probably some give me a perception check.

03:34:30

Boom, excellent. The body is wriggling. Not like the body is still alive. Like there's something in the body. Like, lots and lots of small things and they are eating it.

03:34:59

Hi kind of thing. Would do that? Is it what kind of glass cases this?

03:35:08

It's dirty. Does it have a top on it?

03:35:20

It doesn't actually say how it opens though, I'm assuming. One of the yeah, the top or bottom. Probably comes off, cool. Oh, she's gonna take out a rope. No, it doesn't. And then he's gonna tie the lid closed.

03:35:38

Was about to get violent for kids.
