00:08

So it'll not be a methadone. The other discord, though, by the way, question sounds, you send me a message? No, it was about. It was on from the strange AS game. Oh yeah. No, I figured you would be fine with me taking over You are in most of my games.

00:33

Well moat It's all is the only one that is a question mark at the moment or cell divan.

00:47

That dude, I can't remember his name Oracle.

00:56

It's column Sal that works.

01:32

That's everyone. No. Oh, heavy fear. When did Abby get here? There has been no speak from her yet so I don't know. Myself check is actually good today. I know, I noticed you popping.

01:53

I just quite about. It was literally about tag. You and a conversation. I didn't want to interrupt.

02:05

Why it's your token like that? What did you do to me? I didn't do anything to you but I wonder if that's part of the, the invisibility thing. Now it is nice. That is helpful. I like that. Boom, best rad. Why is it all? Well, we did just we just updated to the version 10 of boundary.

02:31

So a lot of stuff have been upgraded, There's a new ping system, So I don't use the The Mod Pink anymore and the type of ping changes based on the type of thing that you do Enter dasting.

02:53

I'm still learning the rest. If I'm being honest, there's a lot to learn with Foundry. Yeah. And then they release more stuff. Why is everything kind of grayscale inside the hut?

03:11

Maybe that's like a little light vision thing or something. When you don't have sites but you know what? The place. Looks like it goes So you don't have a light source and the map seems to think that it's dark in here. I'm guessing um it's decidedly different than like the path that we walked up to the hut.

03:31

That's very much just dimmer and not full color. There's like a sepia grayscale sort of situation going on inside of it. It's like different. That is weird. I can send a screen cap if that helps, but

03:50

Idk.

03:55

It let's play. I was mostly just wondering if it was a feature. It's not bothering me. I just thought I'd bring it up, not a bug, it for features. Exactly. And any reason why you should be seeing it as gray. And when I click on your token, your vision is colored.

04:18

Yeah, you're not cutting your token, then. Yeah, it'll gray out. Oh wow. Look at that magic. Yeah, I have color now. He feels like this. I've never deselected my token before. I didn't know, I could do that delightful. Oh, I I looked into the whole like, buff icon things on grace, in the worker way.

04:42

And people are saying that is a chance that it's because on some previous map, his buffs are still enabled on his token. That sounds very foundryish.

05:17

It's still there. I will search through the maps at a different time deaf person from it's not a big deal. Boo, but I never would have even considered that. So,

05:36

All right, so let's go ahead and get our recap started.

05:45

One, two, three. Not it.

05:53

Um, okay, So we returned to town that Coast Guard and did a bunch of shopping. Crafting, preparing of the caravan. We talked Kilda into joining, the caravan. I think somebody in the city of Merchant guy invested some money in it as well, to improve it a bit, and then that's quite a bit of time for us to go through all of that.

06:29

But eventually we we left and after I don't remember how long. But a period of time on the road, we're in the snowy area and we saw a hut blocking the path up ahead. I was very suspicious looking. So we went around it and then I think it was like the next day or later that day.

06:50

We saw it in the distance somewhere, like, off the road, we just ignored it. And then the now we've it's like the following day again, and it is in the middle of the road. So we're like, okay, it's not gonna leave us alone. Let's, let's go and maybe we can deal with this peaceably.

07:07

So we came in and we met a kindly old, lady named Baba? Sacha who is some sort of winter witch, and she wanted to know, like she seemed to know a lot about us and our mission. But there's also some that she was asking about why and then I don't remember a lot of the minor details of the conversation.

07:36

Maybe something else can feel that in, but eventually, um, this drink thingy, some stuff I showed up outside. I don't know if we know if she has brought it here or if it just is happenstance or or what? I guess we'll find that out and I do remember there's also she had a bunch of desserts and such and only Ochi part took, if I remember, right?

08:01

I know I partake I don't know if anybody else did. Yeah, and that's that's a quick. A very quick overall recap. There's a lot more details. I missed, though. That was excellent. There's two things I'd like to address. Maybe more shoko revealed to us his True form and tragic backstory TM.

08:27

At least the beginnings of it and it was really cool. And his character art was super sick. No right. All that stuff in the end. Yeah, a lot of fun RP around that, which also was circled around our Two week. Plus one day preparation. Time that we did where we did.

08:44

Some, you did some crafting and we did a little bit of logistics. The other thing was as far as the money that was involved, I believe there, this ties into another thing. Finn now that we had rescued, Amico. And got rid of the frozen shadows. Officially like publicly returned ownership 10 Osui, to the Amitatsu family via Maaco who was been practicing with it to get good with it with Ochi.

09:20

And after all of the shenanigans that was Thorborg. Silver Scores slash Kim and Dotsu using the oh gosh the rhyme Runners. Guild is a front, some kind of elected or otherwise official. Official took over the ride motor skill and kind of sorted all that out and I believe it was either Finn or that character.

09:44

Who would invested the 2000 gold at Sandra's Caravan. We also opened up the um the box. That's right and added geo. Koia and sand drew to the list of scions. In case we die, we can play as Koya or Sandra.

10:16

I think great she wants to play Kelda. So yeah. Um, not necessarily but it's an option. What's it? It's gone already. I'm sorry baby. Break not because of the baby but because I have the mental capacity of a child

10:42

I think that was it. It was a there was a lot of umming and figuring out what we needed as logistically to go into the great white North. This is the Canada Look.

10:59

That is one way to look at it.

11:06

The Are we off to find the northwest passage? Oh yes. Such we rolled some knowledge checks on her. I remember absolutely zero about what any of that was, but she knew what we were doing. We were going back to Mankai to put a Mako on the throne and get rid of the only of the five storms control over me Kai.

11:28

But her great question was, are you going to kill them all? Do you plan to absolutely eradicate the only of the five storms as a faction? Yes. That was her concern. Yes. To which we said. Yeah. But like, you know, the order is negotiable primarily we would like to stay alive and get to Ming Kai.

11:48

But if it might be really slow to kill every single one of them that we find along the way rather than just going there. First She was like, okay, here's some experience points get to work. That is kind of exactly how that was done. Yes, which I'm experience points.

12:10

She was like, are you gonna absolutely eradicate? This this faction of demons and OG's Lake chewing what a cookie and he's like, yeah, definitely no.

12:23

I like to think that maybe OG doesn't use his hands when he eats stuff and just like packs on it like a pigeon.

12:36

There's like all the fancy Forks like a big fancy dinner and he's just like, all this looks delicious and just like a headbutes a table.

13:18

The Abby anything that you are weirdly quiet today. Wow. Thanks.

13:31

No, now you've got everything. Very well then.

13:43

Well, so you join everyone join me in the interested that

14:10

This lady's like willing to sacrifice her whole hut to be ominous.

14:20

All the video assume anything's gonna happen to her hide.

14:27

Oh, she's like just stay inside. They have to come through the doorway.

14:38

It's there everyone. Boom. Local's not here and she sibs. Her teeth The Neo. All right? Why do I know about these things? Um, give me acknowledge Arcana.

15:03

Well, that's okay. You know. That standard frustrates are not generally easy prey, but they're one of the, the weakers of the Drake's, a standard Dragon Train Bo Bum. They have their freezing mist breath, which does a lot of cold damage and a 20-foot radius spread. But Pack has a range of 60 feet and deals.

15:42

Oh okay. So they spray out a template. It takes all the surface and the slippery ice which is something they enjoy.

15:58

Be.

16:04

No vision. They're basically considered the generic cousins of white dragons thrush. Rush dragons are frost predators. They are larger than those drakes though. And these ones also happen to be Oriole creatures.

16:27

Which means they're a little stronger and more durable, and they cannot be tracked in the frozen north at all.

16:48

Do you have any question? Do they have any like SR? I think they have any SR. No, Well here's the other questions. They have any weaknesses or strengths like, or resistance like white dragons. They do have vulnerability to fire. They are immune to cold paralysis and sleep.

17:22

What's up? So I'm going to start off the combat with casting of a single spell.

17:32

I would have heroism on myself and apparent. Oh, there we go.

17:45

And I will move to there.

18:54

Like double move up there drawing, 10 notes away. She goes.

20:05

Wait, no. A invisible. Did the invisible one?

20:15

Yep. Yeah, but I can't see your token anymore. That's because she's invisible. I don't know what you didn't do it. I didn't touch it. I want. Can you guys see her token? Nope. Now we can, oh damn, they enables actually invisible. Now okay, this is this is sweet. That's fucking awesome.

20:41

No more. Transferring tokens to the GM layer bullshit. Hiding them. I can literally just click on invisible. Oh shit. Okay. Hold on, we're gonna try something ochi. They've put a census thing in before there. It is. Tell me if you can see her now. Yes. Yes, they finally got to see invisibility senses working.

21:13

So on your your census tab. This is options been here forever.

21:21

So if you guys cast like seeing visibility or choosing on yourselves, they have those. Yeah, they have all of those now. Very cool. My what? Tab the senses. I don't have those senses attributes on attributes down, look down. It's the third option, the size stature, and then sensors underneath your ability scores.

21:46

And then it's the little like, edit icon next to it. Gotcha, I completely lost the low but I was doing because Coyote was gonna cast Cat's grades on you and then I was like where the fuck is nowhere?

22:10

I mean, guys, here You can't see you. That's correct. So, she casts a spell and says, I'll doubt knowing what into my hands when you want to spell.

22:27

Now, there's a way to do that, right? That I don't do it coya, just puts out of hand for a high five and invisible but it runs by. Exactly. What's about to happen? Boom, boom, right. After a Mako dies and boom, No, none of that.

22:53

Oh, that's way in forward. You need to and easy out of the way, way in. Boom. And does. In fact, it heard.

23:25

Boom, no way. Now I can see you. That's good. That's good. You can see the little like room thing under your token. Yeah, the halo outline gives you a way.

23:44

Well done. Yeah. Fixed by never mind. He won't get cats graces you go past? Yeah. They have pretty much and as she does that, she's also going to the key point to increase your movement speed. So, I'm just trying to figure out exactly how much movement I've got. I'm pretty sure it's ridiculous.

24:17

Yeah, it's enough like

24:23

Though, when you get to about here? Yeah, the Drake's head snaps in your direction.

24:36

And it's nostrils flare, very, very large.

24:44

That's all it does. It hasn't been pointed you or anything but it knows you there? Yeah, I was about to say what you're gonna do act like a dog about it. And anyway, yeah, that was a white dragon. Of course it is. They're the dogs of the dragons. Yes.

25:02

But I am stupid erotaki child. So My turns out, There you go, Which to be fair means, you know, you probably have a healthy respect for white and silver dragons. Okay.

25:18

OG is going to put down his cookie. He real quick and then take off, he's gonna drop it as a free action actually. He doesn't want to waste the action and then Are we going to count like the couch as like, I have to go around it? Okay, we just wave the be running past the couch We can wave that.

25:40

Yeah. Oh she leaps from the couch and runs way out there somewhere? We measure again.

25:52

What is my movement speed right now? It should be 50, right? It is new. No, Yeah, I'm gonna keep point up into 70. You get 140 foot movement speed as you double move. That is true. I don't know. I mean I'm flavoring the ochi doesn't know how to do some of the ninja stuff yet, even though I think I'm like three levels into it at this point.

26:22

Oh you know how to do the base? The base Ninja stuff. It's still training. Yeah, I'm learning by watching and imitating. I appreciate how you're doing. Learning a class. Actually, I really enjoy that RV.

26:43

I think he'll go there. That's what we're going to do. Do I run into a wall like rate here? If I do that, I think I do, I think I do.

26:58

Nope, you should be okay through there. Oh, she's zooms all the way over here and draws his weapons as he does. So, and he's gonna cycle up next to weigh-hand and be like, you should really try those cookies. I was really good. Oh, I already ate one. Okay and that's gonna be OG stir.

27:17

I hate pads, his bag like he's probably got more in there.

27:24

Yeah, and that's all I got for now.

27:31

Or real Drake, gonna take a bite at Ochi and then whip its tail enemy go.

27:46

Did you you bit way in and then you bit me? And then you bit oh is that the attacker to makeover from earlier? Yeah. Okay. Cool.

28:00

Oh a me completely done today. Um, she is getting beat on today.

28:11

Why aren't my automated animations working?

28:52

Here knowing like 10, 15 minutes almost up away for a minute to go. And order some food. Community.

29:37

Everything.

29:44

Chris is going to give a bit of a side eye to the the old lady and just sigh, and he picks up his bow. And he's just gonna shoot from where he is. It is exactly at 110 feet, which is his range increment and yeah, he will do the Niki shot to try to take at least one down earlier.

30:35

Right here. Holy crap range of, that's how 100 feet but yeah. Yep. That that's an otter and that finder? Yep. The boom and then key arrow. Boo, boo.

31:12

Keeping.

32:20

All right, I'm fixing the breath weapon really quick.

33:37

Hey, Reflex saves from Ochi? No, no way.

34:01

Okay, everyone to accept image. That hurted to step in and

34:20

He can't use it again for six rounds, kind of check that doing that Zeo. All right. So I'm going to spend an arcane point.

34:42

Who dimensions, slide.

34:51

But there.

35:02

Target, that one.

35:09

With this working me.

35:21

Boom, those. I mean, adding my text next 30 day. Text that at all. Huh? Get adding my deck 30 at all.

35:37

You let that roll. Probably didn't have next. Yeah, I'm fine. It just needs. Configuring later. Actually.

35:53

Yeah. You don't have an attack ability set in the bill. Oh, this was a straight from the spell list. Yeah, you have to fill some stuff in. I'm starting to learn that too. You will checking? Yeah. Okay, but they have attention of 10, so even your 12 managed to hit it and you almost killed the frustrite all on your lonesome.

36:24

Dang. Oh, you're talking a bit sensed? Well, he went from 98 92H feet of 28. So yes, because fire vulnerability.

36:39

We will. Boom. I'm assuming that's the end of your turn. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, a Mako.

36:52

Energy.

36:59

I think will this. Thank you.

37:27

Lay on him and broken. Why it's broken.

37:49

I did not really. She was a pounded, he is now near the big shape finger guns.

38:12

Let's try that again.

38:18

That back pick up the core.

38:29

And then the monkey touchdler and the same thing.

38:38

One, three and then in one Swift action, she draws 10, no three.

38:56

Will attack.

39:10

And they dragon.

39:40

Okay, when it's six he is still up but he is looking fucked up this one.

39:50

Oh,

39:57

By being quiet, it's gonna come pop out over here.

40:07

Everything is moved slightly. Okay.

40:14

Arably. Sorry. Everyone gets you, some healing.

40:21

Accept the Drake's, of course, the drinks, of course,

40:28

I've never hit Cleo's rest button.

40:33

And then she's gonna quick channel.

40:45

And vermico was looking real hooked up.

40:59

Boom. This Drake hasn't used. It's freezing mess breath yet. I am so sorry.

41:18

Boom.

41:36

Oh yeah.

41:48

Get region.

41:52

No way, It's so weird, not knowing for where you are for certain until your turn Great. Um, So her first attack, she is going to take a swing at the seven. Note strike, what's what's the say for that one again? Sorry, or the at 16. You pick up? Okay, so this is Amanda Tucker on.

42:30

That is missing all of my stuff which is very annoying. Oh okay. So, That apply it's not calculating anyone. But Um, those 24, the 24 does hit. Yes. Okay, the update might have worked all of our stuff. It is possible. Also missing your text dirty bonus.

43:03

What the hell? There was a reset to the compendiums That rolled through, with the updates of the new version. So it's quite possible, we all might have to rebuild some things, okay? Looks like onions in here but we'll find out when I roll. Okay? What a? Let me try this.

43:23

I'm just gonna roll this just for the bandage kids. We we can all agree that it did not. I was there. I saw it. Yeah. Okay, there we go. Just for snake. That. Um, So the bottom one gets, I don't like about dogs. I mean what? Yeah. Please. Um, so that happens.

43:52

I think she gets knocked out of invisibility on the first attack.

43:59

And then immediately redirects all the rooster for damage towards this one.

44:07

Or the on our tech to perflinking.

44:16

Two for flinching. Like you see that one wants?

44:26

That one drops. Cool. And that's that's that's gonna about do it. The boom. Oh, gee. Oh,

44:48

My torn, your turnout. What you gonna do a move?

45:02

All right, the Drake has its AC reduced by full and is also second what you gonna move there and then he's going to do a stab.

45:23

I don't get flanking if nobody's invisible, do I?

45:31

Anybody.

45:35

I don't know. I think that the thing would have to know that it's threatened to be just but Drake knows it needs to protect itself and it's being assaulted from all sides and it knows no way hasn't moved yet because it has set. So it does currently have her pinpoint position.

45:53

Okay, so he definitely is threatened by her. Okay, so I'm gonna call that flanking. Then.

46:06

Murder murder. Murder was starting. Murder murder. Murder. Murder. Murder did what? You just kill a dragon. Yo. Oh she just killed his first Drake whatever. Man. Listen don't take this one. Don't take this away from me. I've never killed a Drake or a dragon before. By the way, you welcome a wicked it for you.

46:29

That's Okay, that's my turn. That return. That's my turn. It's in. Christian is going to and 50 feet forward and he cannot see any of the drinks so far. So he will then double move. We have we have that like hundred gatherer human thing going on here where we're like an extremely mobile party.

47:09

If anybody ever tried to outrun us, they would have a really hard time and that was the turn. Well everyone also technically faster than the video but you can teleport. So like yeah, very limited hack. Number times a day somebody could like run a hundred feet away from us and then we would all just like be right next to them.

47:33

Next turn be like. Hey, where you going? Why are you leaving? Why are you running? So OG, the drink having seen you kill. Its brother bites at the and tail slaps at the. I'm pretty sure the tail flat missed but I'm pretty positive, the bite hits the bite will hit.

47:59

Um, speaking of the recently deceased, he didn't want to take an attack of opportunity. I mean, when I moved he could have hit me there. Oh yeah. They have reach. I forgot about that. Actually, I was like cuz you're attacking me from reach right now. I want to pretend.

48:18

Yeah, she doesn't know anything but I don't think it's 21 hits you though. It does not, but I do take that bite from the newer fellow and that herded, real bad Leo.

48:37

They looked at a new target it with a squishy ray as well.

48:47

Mama, there we go.

48:56

I wish they had a big double damage button to

49:03

Is weakness like as standard like double damage. I was thinking it was like, 1.5 100 value. Was twice as much damage. I don't know, I'm asking I was fairly certain but now I'm questioning myself. Abby, huh. Oh, this is double damage to right now. It's okay. It's 50 1.5 take out as much again.

49:33

Wow. Okay. Well, really.

49:40

It's Jake's aren't meant to be a party wave. So boom. Anything else for you to do and I'm sorry. There we go.

49:58

But well, boom.

50:19

So Amigo says you don't get to take out all of them.

50:28

Two two. Let me.

50:35

She's going to try to not provoke.

50:45

Which is nowhere near enough. They're CMD saying,

51:02

Take a bite and sir though.

51:16

And single. Oh army. And she's gonna miss.

51:31

Websites a little bit.

51:36

That's over here.

51:43

And on energy because OG and Amir over there, getting themselves killed

51:52

And then she's gonna quick channel.

52:30

All right, now, put has been ordered.

52:42

Why do you make things? Keep furnishing going on, weird. Whatever the boom, no way.

53:01

Charge.

53:16

Okay. That broke my check. It did it did.

53:25

I have no way. Yeah. That's, that's a so weird one than that even, I don't know how to fix that.

53:36

It was definitely in a month, there's no way to widen the chat thing either. I know. That's okay. So I'm gonna I'm gonna fix this. But as for the values you want me to reroll another attack. And Well, so just give me another d6 roll. Because yeah, just give me another kind of confirmation role.

54:03

And then a d6 roll if you if you hit and sure the extra damage.

54:13

So, Tested director.

54:23

And I'll just

54:28

Boundaries back in the day. It is chilling. It's taking like three or four seconds just to actually give me my stuff. That again, that was that.

54:48

That should be accurate bum for Boom. Staggered. Second. The last natural armor. Yeah. Cleansing strike. So he believing and stuff, too.

55:20

Already Anything else on your turn? After all of the Drake fillets, you have carved this deep this morning this evening it's evening. Mama being reasonable. Now I'm good. Oh, okay. What you gonna do a step?

55:51

And technically you can just 5 footstep Listen. I want to be complicated. You see that? Mess it up.

56:07

No.

56:11

Why is it so hard? I mean all of that movement is inside of its threat ring, How far can it reach Final five? That's in two squares. And every direction I'm gonna do the thing, I'm gonna go there. As if I foot step. That's very interesting. Then if we're five, footsteping, we will use a key point.

56:45

To do an extra attack during a full attack. Never done this before. This should be exciting.

57:05

I mean the dragon was a zero person attack. Dropped it. I did lots of stab.

57:17

I did not know that I would not have wasted the keep away. Now, you just comes in. Does the like the stereo difficult like stabs the thing and it stood there and you come in and whack. It me just folds up.

57:42

Now that Ochi forgot to do it the entire time. He's also going to roll a knowledge planes on these just for shit, no comment that are coming that one. That's what I said.

57:55

I dislike the witch.

58:01

OG knows that they have wings. See, you do? They you seem to know about these. Do they have anything worth carving out of them for magical crafting or something Christ, man? Oh, she says. And he starts sitting a prayer over the corpse. I mean, I don't know if you want their scales, maybe they they are dragons.

58:29

No, they're drinks. He said very specifically they they are a subcategory of dragon great. I mean, their heart can be useful, their brain can use for their eyes. I don't know. A lot of things about it, actually.

58:48

Grayson's interested in things that might be used for for his tailoring crafting, which might be a little limited from these because they've been scales and leather and all that I'd send you Dragon. Sinew is actually particularly useful in leather working and tailoring. I'm sure could I do like a survival to try to get someone?

59:09

Yeah, I am not going to downplay the dragons, you know, they are very magical creatures used in a lot of crafting. They are also sentient beings. I forget, what bit of dialogue. We left off with, with Sasha before these rolled up. Does anybody remember? Was she clear that she was bringing her little friends?

59:41

Something about heroes of coming trials that I desperately despised on notion and then Dragons appeared. Yeah, I think this is what we're trials. Oh, she's gonna walk back in trying to like shake the blood off as he goes up the steps. He's gonna be like Sasha, you have a dragon problem outside.

01:00:03

It. Have you? Do they bother you often? Oh no dear. I summoned those. Well, I'm really sorry but we killed them. Were you close some of them for you to kill that? I think I have a problem with that.

01:00:27

Why you would have faced their ill sooner or later traveling across the crown of the world?

01:00:38

He's like, keep walking forward a little bit and you just like, that's Well if you knew we would kill him, that's kind of what? That's really rude. Both to us and to them.

01:00:55

I do not really care about your notions of what is polite and what is not polite. If you're going to face the only of the five storms, I need all of you and shape, by the time you reach, Tia, and, oh, she's gonna walk up behind Shoko on the couch and put her hand on his shoulder and be like, thanks for the help, by the way.

01:01:17

Oh, you're very welcome. And more than welcome to anything you find in the hut. No, no, you would actually paddock on the back saying, thank you. Thanks for all your help. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Currently in this temporal stasis. Yeah. Feel free to use the head. It will last for another 24 hours before fades away Mother.

01:01:42

Cookie steak Of course, dear all of the food is for you to take on your journey with you. I know how you young adventurers like to under.

01:01:55

You will find plenty of extra food and water in the cabin. You give me some good rest and I hope you find the treasures youthful. So if I book it, is that an act? What is that? An actual bow on the table. That's a bed. Yeah, but on the bed, there's a boat.

01:02:19

That looks like it's an aborted design.

01:02:28

There's 65 peepees in here.

01:02:36

Did you put that in general? I did. I was looking for it. Let me go ahead and delete that.

01:02:51

And put that inje regions.

01:03:03

Well, nothing else. You're certainly better at? Yeah, friends up. So, while I was looking at these pee pees, she disappeared,

01:03:13

Oh, she got. Oh yeah. When you look back over at her there's just like a bit of falling snow left where she was and she's gone. I don't know if I liked her or not going to go with not and I'm sorry, what do you say there? Say to her.

01:03:31

No way. Oh yeah, just like, well, well, the princess can actually take a hit now that's

01:03:41

Reassuring. It's gonna be the damseland distress for the rest of my life. Could I a Mako? Are you all right? By the way. Oh she says from the porch? Because he forgot about her because he was doing bad jokes. I'm fine about I am a bird. No no yeah.

01:04:01

The new badass fighter stick is way cooler. She did a lot more damage that I did.

01:04:12

It helps that she has, you know, a powerful katana to those fire damage. Yeah, the noise seems to be eyeing. Like it's some sort of alien objectives junction just like,

01:04:31

I'm also vaguely entertaining and entertained that I have sentient swords and two of the games I'm currently running who have wildly different personalities.

01:04:46

They're fine. They can stay.

01:04:54

Oh, there's a chess set.

01:05:01

As we're looting This lady's house. Oh, she's gonna notice the chest set, and I'm gonna say he has played it before and see if anybody wants to play some chess with them later. Would anyone like to play? I really like this game. Yeah, it's a good. A good game frustrategy.

01:05:25

And I'm pretty decent. But that was those kind of games. Hell. Yeah, we're doing a late night chess game later. No way. Grayson role perception for me.

01:05:42

Hmm.

01:05:51

What is? I feel like Grayson is the odds of disjunction.

01:06:04

And then you roll the 19, So YouTube is still the ones outside. And you know it's fun and it's the frozen north all great. And then you guys kind of hear a distant Roar. And see, thank you both got over 30. You see a very white dragon lying across the horizon, not towards you or close enough to currently be a threat.

01:06:42

But you see it?

01:06:48

Hmm.

01:06:52

Well, that might eventually be a problem. Grayson, there's lots of disagree. Grayson, there's lots of stuff in here. You like stuff, you want to check it out. Like,

01:07:10

I'm busy writing it down on my inventory. Sheets. I'll get there soon just I was trying to give you a leg in to tell us that you saw dragon but I appreciate the work on the character sheet. No way you could chime in with that one, too. Since you both saw it, I don't want to tell anyone how to play the character.

01:07:33

No ways. Like I didn't see nothing bro. Actually nobody's next question was going to be. Does anyone happen to have a map? And a Sandra is probably about them in the car? I'm not you know, oh probably has really good naps. Oh, gee should have bought one and did not all has some maps, but most of the crown of the world is not.

01:07:59

Well Yeah I'm pretty sure actually. I bought a map makers. Kate. I'm 100% sure. Yeah that's that's sort of the thing like oh no's. A lot of the area does Shaka because they they live up here in practically but it's more generational than that. Yeah, you they pass down the knowledge of the different paths to take.

01:08:31

If anyone's curious as to what in August why do you want suddenly want like notes of a map? No, I would quite openly say oh I just want to make sure that that fuck off dragon that I just saw isn't going to be on one of our roots. Yeah, I got a map maker's kit so I could kind of track it as we go, but I was more gonna rely on Wolf to actually guide us and have a real map.

01:09:00

It's interview. Led to think you can only take one path through the crown. That's because I know how to follow the stars across the polar north. I understand how they change in the sky as you move. It was specifically to not get lost, not to like draw the one route but to like Mark where we've already gone and keep track of what direction we've been moving in.

01:09:25

We will not get lost this. I assure you. I know where we are going, whether or not we can take the same paths that I normally take is. Yet to be seen routes change constantly with the winter storms.

01:09:50

I'll be more direct. Then You familiar with any dragons operating up and down the pots here. Bigger ones. Not like like thumbs in the general direction. Presumably of all the sinew that Grace and there's probably pilots beginning of senior. How much do I get? Three drinks worth. It's pretty big.

01:10:16

Okay? For most people a lifetime supply of dragons in you For most people. Yes.

01:10:29

You can make a lot of bow strings with that.

01:10:44

Well, how do we feel about the invitation to sleep here? Tonight took care of the drakes in the area and Sasha appears to have accomplish what she wanted though. I don't understand it. I don't think we'll see her again. I mean, wouldn't it be a little weird if we slept here with the caravan?

01:11:06

Just down the road a little bit. I don't know, ask the talking story about what's weird. Talking Sword. Is this weird? I believe it might be someone strange. Perhaps you've been have the caravan move up and prepare your evening camp here.

01:11:32

As the head offended. You in some way. The hut is just seems like it'd be a little rude. If we we slept in a nice dry warm hut. Well, we had everybody else sleep out in the snow and cold. We just make Sandru. Stay in his own caravan and everybody else sleeps in here.

01:11:53

I mean, do you remember what that caravan? Looks like it's cozy as fuck. Yeah, it is like viridian. Know how to, yeah, really know how to run a wagon train luxury. SUV standard here. Yeah.

01:12:17

Oh, geez, gonna hang out in here. He's going over the cookie table, and yes, he didn't lie. All of the cookies and the pastries and the sweet meats, you know, mostly pork, and what not children. Um,

01:12:37

It all saves. It's at least a good two weeks worth of rations. Yeah, he's like sampling everything and like packing it away to store on the caravan. He's like this is This is really, really good stuff.

01:12:57

Tell me when you come across that scroll screening list, you get you guys don't mind. If I use that to scrub it into my book, do you? I don't think anybody minds All the other casters in the group, anybody complaining.

01:13:13

Now Koya. Okay. Nope, play. It doesn't need trolls. I guess I'll add that to my book. I need to make a small craft back to me. If I successfully do it, Can you pass it with just taking a 10? Yeah, I can get a 28 and that answers your question.

01:13:35

Okay, how you would be like a 26? But yeah.

01:13:47

Oh, Jesus gonna scope it out. He's just gonna take a perception. Check, and he's just sitting there munching. After packing everything away on his little lake to go plate and he's just like I in the place seeing how other people live.

01:14:15

Buying that thing makes sense. I was in the wrong half of the book, I would think that Ochi grew up in a house that was smaller than this. And so he's just like this, a nice place. This is fancy and almost have to call guys never mind. We still have to scroll.

01:14:37

I didn't think I had baseball book. I have it myself books. Nice. I am unless anybody stops. Now she's gonna only like skim through any like interesting information that take like one cookie apprehensively and then you'll probably find her on the roof of the hook just kind of sticking back and not doing too much either reading anything that she found.

01:15:05

Or looking out for more goddamn dragons. Parents. Oh, geez, still munching on his thing. And after looking around the goat, is gone crazy. When you go around the side, Oh, she's gonna just remark you. You folks at the intercity, really know how to live. We don't there's not as much land on an island or a peninsula, you know, people tend to live a little closer together my brother and I shared bunk beds in a room that was like 15 by like 10.

01:15:40

This is People in the frozen wasteland have giant huts like this. Amazing. Oh oh she love this hat was obviously conjured with magic. It's not real.

01:16:00

This is a confusing place. Be careful there. You'll give him an existential crisis of that. We can agree.

01:16:12

So can I try and figure out? What if this thing was conjured, trying to figure out what kind of we spell it would be at Welcome. Yeah, it's chicken. It's gonna say which is magic. It's chicken nut. It's like Pizza Hut. But chicken. You tell me we're in a KFC.

01:16:33

There we can probably KFC on that combination chicken and Taco Bell. Well.

01:16:46

Boom, Amiko. Found the bath. Is this a feather bed? It is a better bed. It's very comfortable. This is I don't like this, any climbs off of that.

01:17:05

Oh, I'm so sorry. LG, I just realized that would be terrible for you. She goes outside. At room is filled with remains of my dead kin.

01:17:26

So is Ravens crack and you don't see me complaining about it. Oh, You're right.

01:17:43

Hey though, you guys bring the caravan up, you rest for the evening.

01:17:54

Do we rest for the evening? I should hope you rest for the evening. It is evening time but it is also your guys's choice. I suppose.

01:18:13

Now, I'll take the key point back. That's fine.

01:18:19

Well, I could just hold on to which for you.

01:18:25

That's how that works, right?

01:18:33

And Ochi is going and very very bright. Oh, she's gonna ask Lady. You may go. Would you play a song? Something. Maybe extra minkai and I'm excited to be returning home. I want to be reminded to see if a makeo will play some tasty jams. Um, Yes, she will more than happily does anyone else.

01:19:00

See, really weird with no effects. Yeah. It's like yeah, It's funny. Why is my what half of it? Not even there still probably like I'm following the bottom half.

01:19:27

And just go ahead and turn that off.

01:19:42

But let's drop that density down. Oh my god.

01:20:01

And now for the snow story and stop broken.

01:20:12

Trying a difference now.

01:20:19

Wow. Okay, so my weather effects of not working for some reason that's fun. As we are about to go into a bunch of maps, that involve a bunch of snow and weather effects difficult. We'll see how that goes.

01:20:40

All right. So, but alone we've resumed but to go.

01:20:56

We call this the first day. Again, press button now. Oh yes, feel free. And continue.

01:21:32

Helda we killed. Some drakes, Isn't that? What you were hunting down? When we found you, Do you want to go kick one of them? Maybe the frozen North. I'm sure there will be many opportunities to fight the cross strikes. My group was unprepared for the viciousness of a sea dragon.

01:21:58

I didn't know if you were doing a blood feud or something against Drake's, just thought I'd offer it is much appreciated. Can I mark a blood feud against, just like the frozen north at this point against cold Soleilu? I do not like the weather here. Model lack of visibility constant shivering, affections of being unable to properly, move things around for logistical purposes.

01:22:33

What are you talking about? Eternal winter is fantastic. As no. I dripping with so much sarcasm, you're almost certain that it's going to actually physically help them. Yeah. But nobody bothers you Your neighbors, stay in their house related, looks like she's actively considering trying to shoot. Both of you with about, there's something I wish you would.

01:22:57

It's just I don't want to have for Christmas.

01:23:11

Boom, and I'll be right back. Play is going to be the Mariah Carey.

01:23:23

Oh, hell yeah.

01:23:29

Nope. Just,

01:23:37

She likes them, you know, sofas like two standards and then it's like, I can't do it. I'm not doing it. No, no. So, no guys know what I caravans finds for picking tools. Hold matters around recording project and just walks out as I know not doing this of her brain counter.

01:24:09

You. Oh, Jesus gonna do some important. Caravan to move at half speed for 1d4 days. Oh, geez. Doing serious scribblings at night in his little journal. Hey, so you're very first day of journey out from the hut, you encounter a blizzard, then wasn't a very white spending blizzard. Actually, it's you just have harsher, snow conditions, for the next day of travel, which means you lose about half your progress the next day, but you still make some boom.

01:24:49

I'm so sorry. They're so many encounters.

01:24:57

84. Oh no. Content. 84 actually the, but I heard that ABC thing. Starting. I don't know what you're talking about But what was 84 Pleasant weather. So shortly after your blizzard, you actually get several days worth of traveling done where the temperature rise up at one category. Warmer. It's very mild conditions and increases your speed for the next one before days.

01:25:38

Really, that's a jackass move. Boom. You guys may have just bypass anymore. Random encounters. A. All right. So your next stop on this journey? A again be I can't really show you guys all of this.

01:26:13

All right, so you get down out of the passes into the open snow.

01:26:33

Accounting, please.

01:26:38

The path of back and high.

01:26:50

And,

01:27:01

All right. Coming down out of the north Planks of the rain-throughs mountains to do.

01:27:14

It looks like during the blizzard while you were coming down, you might have beard slightly off to the left.

01:27:23

And you see What looks like a wide barrow lands.

01:27:34

You are still on a road though.

01:27:49

You make it this off. What do you making this? Are we going to keep following the road or do we want to try and cut off of it?

01:28:02

What's can we get a pros and cons from Wolf? Yeah, exactly. If we cut off of the road, we can make quicker pace across the plains, The road kind of follows along the mountain rim for a vids.

01:28:29

What is my not to be able to find some game out there? If we need to hunt, What is everybody think? I favor a faster route. It's beautiful up here, but I'm very cold all the time.

01:28:48

And what would that the downsides? What cutting across Well and we'll Well basically have two options The primary out of the path bag and high runs northwest through, the urataki lands who has Sonali. We can skirt along the bear legs and the guard. You heels north of the hills, the path follows the Tarasca River through a high tundra of the Orwell.

01:29:18

March towards the town of Wunaimo. Last major trading village before the path climbed onto the high ice through. The come Helmsford Gap. This path is easier and generally faster, but the lens it crosses are more inhabited potentially exposing us to unfriendly eyes As an alternative route. We could head due.

01:29:43

North through the Gardrock heel Hills cutting off a white, bend of their route of our route, and avoiding more civilized lands, more direct, less people, less direct more people, right? However, the Hill Country is far more, rugged and remote, and with fewer chances for us to resupply or seek help if troubles should happen upon us shortcut.

01:30:14

OG votes shortcut.

01:30:22

Grayson, what are your favorite?

01:30:27

Fine, with either. They and roll. Like, I could do a coin flip on it in the way.

01:30:40

I'd have to agree that faster and Heroize would be beneficial. We still don't know the exact time scales rotting. Any further repercussions of coming this way and opening the box. Zeo, what do you think? Oh yeah, that happened. Why do I? Well, if we getting any trouble because the short route, we may not get help that we need.

01:31:12

And particularly, if we can get in any crumbled, taking short route, we could also somehow hit something in those we lose heifer, supplies, I'm just preparing for the. Absolute worst. Sounds like there's only two strong opinions. So we can either coin flip or we can do the shortcut. Those are your options.

01:31:36

Just one more question for y'all out of interest. Shoot you say that most of the mapping around the region crown of all this virtually impossible to do because of constant changes. I get. But but is there any chance that we could potentially call back in and ask those are attacking about a map or a current easier route either or it's always better to be able to check in with people who are living and breathing.

01:32:11

This environment That is actually an excellent idea. We could get more up to date information on the state. Now that the storms a, the current seasonal layout of the North, that's a good idea. I think we should take the roads. You've changed my mind, will take the normal path to back in high.

01:32:34

Yes.

01:32:38

Bum bum? No, I just kind of drugs. I was like just say So did you just say, hey we're gonna take the road and prepare for the worst. I took the route.

01:33:03

Boom. Boom.

01:33:12

And and regularly constraining.

01:33:40

All right, so you to do. You descend into Actually a rather. Nice leak country. Oh no, sorry I'm skipping ahead. Let's go back, let's go back. We still have to finish going through the barrow down.

01:34:07

You right. 20% chance per day and it's gonna take you three days.

01:34:25

Not spot you that day. All right, under 40% this time.

01:34:34

There's 60% this time.

01:34:42

Wow, I thought

01:34:51

All right, so as you guys are traveling on the third day,

01:34:58

The sound of the wind picks up and it starts to snow a little heavier and you hear a booming voice on the wind.

01:35:18

Come to raid the giant barrels. Have you human? No.

01:35:27

We're just passing through.

01:35:39

Perception be that you do. Can I tell where that came from? By chance. Um, you can tell it's a spell that's carrying his voice on the wind to you guys.

01:36:05

Maybe we should pick up the pace, probably from up on top of one of the hills in the area.

01:36:17

Quit furiously through the mistance. Now about sure you may perception Jacks. Looking around at the hills.

01:36:31

You know, the role. Another one OG. Okay.

01:36:41

Yes, you guys actually do. See what appears to be a frost giant up on a hill. Where you think? You might see some ruins.

01:36:58

Pages hood, he looks older.

01:37:12

And you feel really of comfortable with them.

01:37:23

Oh she's gonna ask our doggo friend actually pregnant. Hey, do you know that guy?

01:37:32

And why would I know him? I don't know. You're from this area. No, you know, every bird that lives for you are people ask me all the time. Yes, I No.

01:37:49

Do you know anything about the frost giants in the area? I know they are good kin to my people. Frozen north flows in them as well, so they won't give us any problems. If we don't give them any problems. The old Giants may be looking for a way to die if it's time has come and he appears, he will not die in battle.

01:38:20

Interesting, LG rates that down. It may be a kindness for you to kill him.

01:38:36

He actually thinks about assumption talk. Yeah, he thinks about that. One for a while. Love assumption talk coming from the neutral, evil winter world. Yep, it it's like oh the guy has given us one warning on the wind seems to be a slightly older gentleman and you seem to think he had to death which which to be fair given it's us.

01:38:59

I don't disagree with, but That seems like more bother than it's worth and we gotta go.

01:39:10

Yeah, he's the wrong. He's the wrong kind of giant colored. Look in person. Funky color person. What came out? Very. Wow. I was trying to remember what color? The Not only whenever like red, right? I can't remember what color, the Oni were. Okay, he's the wrong color, Giants. We're not here to kill this once.

01:39:41

That I'm yeah, there's no redeeming that one. We'll just move on from that.

01:39:58

Purple, boom. So we continue on mining our business.

01:40:12

Grayson and Kelda aren't gonna sneak off in the night with stuff lust and fight that guy, right?

01:40:21

It depends on your perception. Ability versus yourself. That's true. I bet I could catch Kilda, I don't know if I could catch Grayson. I mean, Kilda does look a little unhappy, but she's not gonna get it despite the giant today. See stuff lust I think that's more like glory list and stuff list.

01:40:45

I think so she's super glory left. I think I think OG should be well that by this point, you really should be yes as well as by. Now, I think Grayson has finished crafting, his only other item that he had materials for

01:41:04

So, if you finishes a pair of delaquescent gloves,

01:41:18

It totally forgot. I had that bed that wand on me.

01:41:27

A wonderful primaril.

01:42:05

And there's so many people in this caravan. Now I sorry. Simple. You know, what do we got? We got a monkey, a helmet. The OG, caravan all the Scions a bunch of random Vikings and a wolf. Am I missing anyone? Nope.

01:42:35

And counter. One sharps point people points of ten necessary. Yeah. Pointy boy, we forgot about him.

01:42:51

Through a win in a fight. Three frustrates are one pointy boy.

01:42:58

Pointy. Boy. Flaming. Pointy. Boy slimming pointy black And we are going to take our break right here because I need to be and, you know, a drink

01:43:18

KK.

01:48:16

Way.

01:49:33

First place.

01:50:01

No. Okay, I'm gonna make sure and I'm giving you I keep on these things like that requirements,

01:50:17

Let's get back up here with you. Yeah, I don't like it. I don't know.

01:50:45

Interpretation.

01:50:50

I will talk about that after I actually read the first book, I think it all resistive. All right, no problem.

01:51:16

Idea you that's just from here. It's just Zack and it was racing back. I am back, okay.

01:51:39

Though.

01:51:43

On your last night at the edge of the barrel grounds.

01:51:53

Boom.

01:52:01

Just hanging out.

01:52:50

So I need video and OG and Koya. And I her new hobby is getting hit by breath weapons apparent.

01:53:07

Well, that's a thing.

01:53:18

Well done OG.

01:53:24

And only OG consumed, all of the reflects from everybody else.

01:53:51

15. Oh, she did take half.

01:54:00

And of course he is amazing. Yeah. And of course, he's getting invasionment. I don't have a vision, boom.

01:54:14

Boom. I wish I had a vision and the wolf snarls at you.

01:54:29

And Is this the wolf that's been traveling with us or the one we saw with the giant? Boom. I don't know, but there's another one that isn't named. So, I don't, I would assume I still hear the named. He's named that one is named. Oh, it's going to his token.

01:54:58

Excuse me.

01:55:05

But and no, these this is not the one that have been traveling with you. He it's sleeping right up here.

01:55:20

Right here.

01:55:27

Is he doing that? Cool winter. Dark Is he couldn't doing that cool winter dog thing where you just falls asleep and then the snow covers him pretty much. Yeah, that's the cutest shit ever but it's a giant with your wolf. Yes. A terrifying wolf as the Siberian girl.

01:55:54

Something not joined me, I'm not joining initiative. I'm sorry. Why is it not?

01:56:10

There's a bunch of your stuff borked or what? Mmm.

01:56:22

Come up. No, I think I fixed it. Mainly was just like linking stuff and raising but not that it was pulling from stuff that didn't have my snake attack comes up.

01:56:40

I think we have fixed it. Okay, everyone. Good. Yeah, video. Well, Theo's, great use in arcade point and GTOF, I don't know.

01:56:59

About there.

01:57:13

Then he pulls up. It's like want a magic missile and I think that's all he can do. I don't think I can do anything else.

01:57:29

Already.

01:57:38

No way. That was going on, You hear some sort of scuffle happening?

01:57:57

Got it.

01:58:02

Okay, okie dokie. Key point.

01:58:11

And then continue to movement. Very gets me in there.

01:58:21

Traditional 30. Yets need to there. Oh oh, I hate this.

01:58:38

You probably smell really cool.

01:58:48

I mean, it's no as you probably reeks of chemicals you just smells like you'll die.

01:58:58

Yeah, that are vaguely fruity like vape juice. Yeah, um, well no way you getting to talk about opportunity. I'm pretty sure you're somewhere there not gonna. Yeah, you don't get swung up time. Oh no, No. She's, she's not gonna do that because the blender needs to be an acted.

01:59:32

You and actually Shoko really shouldn't be here. That. I like to think that noise is trying to figure out which one is actually like our friend and also that like light sources, no longer here is gone.

01:59:55

Boom.

02:00:01

Oh no. Spark Maaco took it all that time. Of 15 is not an.

02:02:09

Oh, by a quick. Everybody stab the wolves while they can't do anything. Bitcoin. You just die.

02:02:25

Little quiet, maybe dead. Is anyone able to see a health bar on a makeup? Nope. No.

02:02:49

That's, that's a health fun.

02:03:04

Haha, What chat discord chat?

02:03:12

Peace.

02:03:20

That may take some time.

02:03:32

Welcome back.

02:03:37

And my Mac. Yes, yay.

02:03:46

Well, it looks like Toyojo Then alive Apple. I,

02:03:55

Oh, I just of textures are fit. Yeah, we will because he's hosting it.

02:04:39

Let me look back in. No.

02:05:34

Oh, that can't be good. Okay, there it is.

02:06:21

I have good news. Is that? What's that? That fixed the snow effect. Yay.

02:06:33

I was just sitting here thinking like if you just zoom in really far it fixes the snow effect because then it fills your whole screen but I was like wait, it wasn't on my character before. Maggie so clear is dead. RIP. No, I think I gave her double damage.

02:06:55

I did.

02:07:02

That would be inconvenient because I was getting a little frustrated that nothing was happening and the server was exploding in my internet was going up.

02:07:22

That was his turn. Koya might be dead. If this dude had an already used his breath weapon,

02:07:42

And 16 hit you OG If it ties. Yeah, I have an acted. 16 is my flat foot.

02:07:53

Pepper. Boom and gets. He just says to meet your AC. Okay? That hurts. I didn't like it at the 27, Beecher CMD. That's a great question. I'm sure it does. But let me look.

02:08:19

It's 23. So yes, it does. So this winter wolf steps up to you reaches out grabs you by the leg, like you were always told of the child, they like to do and rips your legs out from underneath you and trips, you hell? Yeah, this is every baby bird's horror story.

02:08:41

It really is not crap. One second.

02:09:12

Then that is the end of his turn reason. Personal follow up and ready his bow. And then he'll be like oh she you seem to be unhappy with everything I do recently. So why don't you tell me? What would you like me to do here? I would like you to sit down and talk with these wolves about their feelings and perhaps help them resolve some of their unresolved traumas and see if we can't all be friends.

02:09:42

Grayson obviously. Okay, Grayson sits down. And we'll I feel like so wolf, you know, we have one of your kind in that the caravan with us. It's got some vendetta on, but we're kind of friends-ish you guys want to? You want to talk it out? You have to mean it.

02:10:09

I want to see some rolls here. You're welcome to see my social roles. I don't visible because I don't like the waste is happening. There you go. So, the wolf looks you dead in your eyes, like right into your soul and just sort of bites down a little harder on OG's leg.

02:10:35

Yeah. Yeah, we saw that coming and grow.

02:10:44

Okay, well that was great since June, that's fine. I deserve that. And boom.

02:11:04

More than all such.

02:11:14

Where you gotta make my life so hard.

02:11:21

Description of spell is not in his one for some reason.

02:11:40

Manage moving. Okay.

02:11:50

But that's

02:12:01

Boom. I may go.

02:12:14

I'm just,

02:12:42

And scores quite deeply on this one. Okay. Can you use Acrobatics to avoid an aqua an attack of opportunity when standing up Now? Unfortunately, not did not think there's roadtile. Not allows you to do it and the finesse. Yep. No, not my role. Yeah.

02:13:20

Sorry, I had to close something. Okay. OG's gonna stand up as a move of action, doing what he's got to do.

02:13:36

A 15, misses you, that does miss me. So,

02:13:47

Oh my god. Here in my little cheat sheet.

02:14:02

Yeah, we're just gonna go for a stab, I think. Um, yeah, we're gonna go for a stab. Get a turn on defensive stance.

02:14:22

And do a poke.

02:14:33

That actually hits him and there's quite a bit of damage OT would like to do the thing that Grayson was trying to do. And negotiate with these wolves. Did they seem to understand language with Grace and talked to him like the other one spoke, right? So, these should also speak.

02:14:59

You know, you speak can what's a relevant knowledge? Check nature For them knowledge. O'Connor Arcana. I'm gonna roll in Arcana on.

02:15:18

Oh, I just like I don't have a buff active that should not be active right now. He's gonna essentially say there's no need to fight and try and roll the plumcy if that matters. If we can even care to try, they don't. Okay, that's fine. They want to eat you.

02:15:40

Yeah. They look like hungry, boys and girls.

02:15:51

Oh, what?

02:15:56

My bird eyes. See, danger, you say.

02:16:04

No, Where's the light coming from? Oh, out of the caravan door. Gotcha.

02:16:12

Yeah, your campfire may have gotten extinguished but the the candles in the caravan side,

02:16:21

Anyways, that's OG's. Old turn right? Oh nope, That was the wrong but Welcome.

02:17:06

Wow. Okay, way the role really bad actually Lou.

02:17:19

Oh gee on. His turn is also gonna yell to Grayson, they don't want to listen to reason. You can shoot them now.

02:17:34

You say so the charge?

02:17:49

Next week, almost critical Christmas lights. She's fucking fighting a giant hard. Fucking damn it, cousin.

02:18:11

All right.

02:18:36

You know, it's kind of amusing that Koya's entire first realm and combat lately has just been channeling. Positive energy. A cute party alive. If it work.

02:18:56

You get the second heel too. I did not.

02:19:04

Now I did big channel is hands down the most efficient feet. She's purchased in her leveling up. Getting a lot of mileage Veo. Oh, what an object. If I know what if this thing has SR, if what thing has a sir? The big, big guy, knowledge, local. He's a giant.

02:19:40

I think it is. Local.

02:19:46

And most humanoid. Yeah. There you they don't normally have scold resistance unless you're talking about the uber powerful ones that would have already killed you guys. Okay, well then I guess I'm gonna I'm gonna be doing this fall against it.

02:20:08

But I'm also going to be spending an arcane point to increase the DC.

02:20:15

But a DC-19.

02:20:23

And again, you came Keith Spain. And you got, ah, crap. Yeah, they're four tapes gonna be great giant. Yeah, Diane Anything else, sir.

02:20:49

No, that's pretty much it.

02:20:54

That back.

02:21:01

Why does my picture keep getting stuck? Up Wednesday, dirty underhanded, You will pay for that.

02:21:18

But what's going on? Five foot step, murderized the wolf. Oh, it skipped over you. No way. So, First attack God, fucking damn. And I need to trace. I don't know why it does it genuinely don't know what's going on with that. Hey I'll just give me a confirmation role and an extra damage rule.

02:21:48

Well it's a overall plus 12. Yeah, it's not 20 was not.

02:21:56

That's the big damage. It is big damage to a wolf. Authority been pretty damaged. It's the one that was closest to me. What already? I want mostly a confirmation role. And another thing tag place or had your crit damage. Yeah, I'm trying to make sure that I don't give you incorrect one.

02:22:19

Anyway that yeah. Okay. 15. You and yet about whatever. Um, boom, that knocks around invisibility at least but the boom. I'm just gonna pre. I don't press again until I fix this better looking negative 4 to its AC. If it has natural armor or it does,

02:22:53

Oh, Winter Wolves actually have a natural army or seven. All right. It might be started. But I I rolled the two. So, my offhand is not nearly as good. I just super blinking. Let's do our thinking. Oh no. 14. Fish question. Mark. A 14 will hit. It's AC of 13.

02:23:34

Motorized murderized please. Please continue.

02:23:49

Why do I smell other wolves in my territory? No, I did not to use thing then back invisible.

02:24:03

I love this Chicot you there AC isn't 13 before the natural armor reduction, right?

02:24:15

But nothing. No it would have been four points or yeah four points higher. If she hadn't filmed his natural armor down. Okay.

02:24:32

Fun things. Break is very good acne, had two double move.

02:24:43

Mysterious suddenly looks concerned, but it's also been two round so he can do this again.

02:25:01

Actually edge step.

02:25:12

And,

02:25:17

You wanted to get three of you.

02:25:22

Boom. Goddammit, Korea, you're pretty good reflex saves for player. He shouldn't be missing these and then okay, as well.

02:25:38

Breath weapon again. Yep, but now he can't use it for four more rounds, and I failed it again.

02:25:51

It was 16, right? It 17 the DC or the damage easy. It was also 17 damage. Okay.

02:26:07

Apparently the damage and heel numbers are aren't showing up anymore? No, because the module hasn't been updated yet, so I haven't reinstalled it. Okay. Okay, then recent wool take aim at the one that just did the grip weapon.

02:26:35

Okay, so tops and gonna try out. Hopefully, my addition of the stuff for the gloves now, that's it.

02:26:55

Acid.

02:26:59

It turns any weapon? The just turns any item that you carry into corrosive neat. Yeah. And it also points to unarmed attacks as well that you use your hands for. Yes, I love how you range it. 1100 feet. I think it's a little off there. Well, that's the max range of that's, yeah.

02:27:30

Room. Well, that's both winter. Wolves down. It's such a wild range to think about hitting anything at that's over three football fields.

02:27:47

Theo, did you hide behind Shelelu?

02:27:55

The bit, maybe.

02:28:01

Wow, he is a spellcaster, I know, but the giant really wants to kill you now.

02:28:23

He is gonna slam.

02:28:40

He's gonna bully slam and kill the

02:28:47

He Kirk bunches at her.

02:29:06

Do.

02:29:16

Anything apparently unhand is not fixed.


00:00

They're also capable of casting photos once per day. So you don't want them standing boast you. And then Then the big guy, the same religion check. Correct. Boom. Have a low You recognize it as a frost fallen undead, but beyond that you aren't sure of any of their stuff.

00:35

Awesome. You kind of glossed over them while you were studying one night.

00:42

All right. Well, I'm guess I will hit the one. That's next right in front of me, with a nice scorching ray. Now that takes it out, they'll target the big guy with the other

01:11

And nope, he's still up.

01:25

And not looking happy with you. Of course, there never happy with me people, then you just hit him. Looks fire. People will then take move. I want arguing myself.

01:45

Let me move them and just all right. Clear quiz going to channel. Nope. Okay, that's fair.

02:05

Oh yeah. It's going to try and you. Yeah, and

02:20

Are.

02:26

Serious.

02:42

Out Koya.

02:47

Oh, he's an extra big boy, isn't he? I didn't realize that. Yep, you huge.

03:01

Make and nasty or prosperion. It's gonna double move.

03:16

Now, double blue.

03:28

Nico.

03:46

Come on.

03:54

Everyone gets 6 points in healing.

04:06

I can't believe. Oh yeah, pets are on the shoulder. It just tastes practice. Dear, that's so rude. No. So based on one important thing, I'm gonna just ask my uninterest. I'm told no way these things have predators out, right? Yes. Oh, really good. Human said anything. You. I mean when he when he noticed the little guys, he would say what what, what they have.

04:44

I I thought it would be a thing he would do. It's we can rule that you always say it but we want to hear that from you kind of I would say personally, it is going to be him. He will always wake up when he figures out what these things are.

05:00

People always say what they are or what they can do, or what they have? Yeah. What do you think? It's just, like, depending on how you describe things would have been whether or not, I do something. Whatever. If you've done them, they can see you past your shinamidans, you know, and it's like I hate these.

05:18

Um yeah, they can see heat so that she doesn't just try to walk past them and get like eviscerinist. Yeah, that was growing to happen. No air. Just like I'm gonna sneak around behind this mammoth and he's just like stomp. Yeah, pretty much just like, oh yeah, Why not it noted.

05:43

I hate this motherfuckers.

05:48

Okay. So 20 punchy. Stabby. Stabby to do something. I suppose oh, it's all of this. He literally all of this.

06:11

So far, this is like the anti-Ninja campaign it isn't. It's just that there's been a lot of occasions where things are that I could get away. With didn't make sense they're like we want you to fight nothing but things with like heat vision, other ninjas and swarms like just be happy that I completely forgot about the things that had blurs throughout book two.

06:36

Yeah. Because more things have concealments as these books progress. Perfect. So you guys got a break from the early stuff, but it's gonna be coming up a lot. Something tells me this giant mammoth doesn't have combat reflexes. I'm waiting to get smacks. I'm giving me that the order of the space come on, does not have combat reflexes, but she are you at trying to act robotics through?

07:05

It's threatened squares. Yes, because it's I because I'm interns see here in every tree. Well, am i wrong and saying that it only gets one attack of opportunity for turn? Unless it has combat reflexes. Yes. Would you make me assumption that noise isn't trying to get here? Which means I've got this guy to concern about, it's okay.

07:31

But because like here he took his second opportunity on quite exactly. That's what I was getting. I was like you can get stabbed by the little guys, that's probably fine. I wouldn't want to get gored for 5 feet of movement, like just just looking at that attack rollback. If this thing rolls, I feel over.

07:49

So this is going to be really funny and that's all I'm gonna say about.

07:57

Yes, you did. Want an acrobatics? Just really as hit hard? Doesn't it? It really does. And like I tried Looking up to see if they were any weird bonuses or anything but there's not. I I'm sadly say I think it's damages wrong for its gore. 28 on the huge creature 13 and then half the strength again.

08:31

We don't think that's a common gore trade actually. Yeah, this you're missing if it's the only natural attack it has. If it's the only primary attack it has it does get 1.25. They get the power attack multiplier. If it has any other natural attack he does. It also has two slams that it hasn't been able to use yet legally.

08:55

Oh my god, that terrifies me. Yeah, that's glorifying. Should this thing is actually quite nasty. Um, yeah. And we trade this guy. I'd like to fight the dragon instead. I don't actually thinks would but your current line maybe the dragon is even worse. The dragon, the dragon is being foreshadowed right now.

09:23

It's it's a near the end of the book battle. Hmm, It's an optional fight, right? Totally optional. Here. We'll go with that for now. Cool. That's right. You were fine. You managed to the cartwheel past, the Horcross Spirit create.

09:47

And let's put directly in skull. Why did you know? Hey kid because my attack rolls are doing funky shit. Again, that's what I've been sakia doing and so roles. So again things you didn't tell me now, he mentioned it, The imagined it we can do. Yeah, yeah. So mmm, it's a little.

10:19

That's fine. I now have loved. Ah, okay. That's kind of fucking dumb. Also they hit you. You're gonna take Dex damage if you fail fort safe. Yeah, okay. So this character's probably dead, I'm gonna go ahead and just like assume that I'm gonna roll up. Another character cracko. It's Grayson, that's another joke.

10:46

Grayson, these are not intelligent. We do not have to negotiate with them, please. Please shoot them a lot that dear horror frost matter. Would you like to reconsider your attack here? No, that's not necessary. It's really not necessary. I don't think they're sent here. The smaller ones first but seeing how devastating the mammoth has been.

11:11

He's going to go for that and do a full attack with Keisha. What is wrong with this skip? And I swear. Boom. First arrowhead second arrowheads third arrow. Misses, he arrow hits.

11:38

And then directly five, footstep.

11:48

Oh shit. I forgot that I have play in. Go. He was holding his action. He goes down.

12:49

Help you prepared for this. We get, they're all everybody's too close.

12:59

Wow. Okay, where where

13:15

Oh, gee

13:21

The compendium. Oh, never mind. I'm seeing it now.

13:28

Oh geez. Gonna cry. I'm going to as a move action, use barroom brawler to gain the benefit of unconquerable resolve for one minute. So, 10 rounds, I will have to find these things and then he's also going to use a standard action. I believe to use shadow clone but I have to pull those things out of the companion, only dookie

14:06

Have quantities. It's one before was not. Yeah. But I want to get them on my thing. So I don't have to dig about next time. So yeah, that's what's going on. Okay, then you got your your turn going. You're just getting stuff. Yeah and I can throw them up.

14:22

Once they oh my page is literally frozen. That's what's happening right now. Okay, so that's my turn. You can move on and I'll get those things up.

14:35

It's likely a taxi remote Anders that I'm doing to them. That's already annoying.

14:50

But,

15:25

They can do color pull with the past two level of three. Apparently what that's weird.

15:39

And this is why I pulled up unconquerable resolve.

15:49

Like a caster level of three but a saving throw you. DC 17. Well, I failed but I still think 9:20 dammit.

16:05

Yeah. Okay. That's gnarly.

16:19

A monkey must have region.

16:28

Boom, and completely miss no way.

16:35

Don't worry. Nothing else will. I'm sure that's fair. So, the trunk will go and

16:54

So if we made the save, it's tap David, Okay, unless you have evasion and then it's no damage. Christian doesn't take any candies. Like Yeah, mugs tend to have evasion and do not as a center, you don't. Oh. Okay, let's see. Koya, Ochi weigh in and no way are all within range.

17:20

So, one is Koya. Then counting down to no way. It's four.

17:29

You.

17:34

He's got a skewer, the monkey with his score.

17:43

Well, Well again is down.

17:52

I've got a lot of dead.

18:12

Okay, I'm sorry. I got all this stuff added. Did I get hit with anything? You did not. What was the and what was the D4 for from the mammoth for an attack on who exacting? Okay. And then he is going to step on Ochi and step on no way.

18:37

At Mochi. Okay. I have two duplicates. I think one. No way. Keith. Yeah, you are. You're pretty sure that you heard like an entire left side of her body and just like crumple inwards from that.

19:03

Oh my god.

19:08

Oh my god. Zeo, Can you stop creating me? I wish I could I really do. Wish I could stop hurting you. Oh, hi at the original way where I can target all just to them. With this spell, I would love to. Okay. So Fireball then do it to hit me.

19:31

I have three images. So we got a roll of D4 and we'll call it one hits me. Good point. All right. You lose an image, okay? Two images left. I should.

19:54

And and again I don't think OT really knows what is happening or what he's doing. He's just like panicking and like really doesn't want to get hit because he saw what happened to Koya and himself already. Here's a question. Is that where I'm about to through this and that actually there.

20:18

And Yes what the fuck? I didn't realize oh fuck never mind. I would have to move it one more. I don't want to get fucking weigh in. Well, then stop trying to hit. Absolutely everything. Look, we go here.

20:45

Fireball hits the Macedon, the thing currently murdering, the party doesn't destroy any of your caravan or familiars. I mean, it burns those buildings a little bit. I would imagine they're already frustrated just so is the mammoth It's just as resistance. This is the, the caravan is. I'm sorry, I'm splitting hairs.

21:10

Yeah, that's where. That's why I would go. I asked them and well, thank you. The man of dies before EPKing, the party. There's like a steaming pile of bird droppings right underneath Ochi. Well, we are still in combat though But oh, I know he didn't. He couldn't hold it.

21:40

Yeah, that was the end of my terminal. Apparently, I somehow ended my term but even realizing it.

21:51

These are not heels either harsh.

22:12

And you technically what we have full charges?

22:23

That one dies. He also only has 20 left, that one dies.

22:34

He has 23 left and she did 26. He also dies the battle ends and players out of channel energy. I'm gonna go about that point that I originally just kills over in the snow face down.

23:04

He still has secure critical so three. Oh geez. Say a prayer over all of these bones.

23:16

All right, we are at about stopping. Anyways, we only got about 10 more minutes left, but there is a lot of loot. Remember the irritaki settlements? It's easy to sell non-magical stuff. I will post their stats every puppy encampment.

23:41

So you can see what you can sell while you're in these places.

24:02

To purchase limit is how much they can buy from us. It's the maximum a values that we can purchase from them. Yeah. Up to a thousand, they can purchase something up to 200. Okay. And how many of these villages do we come across? I probably only a couple while you're making your way up path.

24:32

Considering how many times we rolled for the dead heavens and shit. People are probably not hanging out in this area much anymore. So you can also spend multiple days at the settlements if you choose, but you guys aren't going to go to a decent sized arrow. Hockey, like, town at the end of this first, leg of the journey, though, there will be some more options for selling things, but not a whole lot.

25:03

Okay, I'll just sell. Well let's say like, what? Three, three villages, encampments, worth. That seems fair. It's been three days. Oh, she's gonna ask if anybody has anybody else ever seen elephant of that size before I saw some in voudra? But nothing quite that large. I can't say they were very common in Russia.

25:39

Boom, boom. I mean, no, I mean, I would pay for check to see how once get that big Yes.

25:55

That was a Mastodon.

26:00

And that was a matter.

26:07

That for.

26:12

All right. No one is look like they're dying anymore. Oh god, except for Same monkey. Yeah. We that says, no effect. Still in the ground. Not mentally take more. All right, everyone is up to have life. Koya. Is that a fourth level spells? Perfect. I like this. Well, all this was an interesting day.

26:47

What do you like there? All these fights are terrify.

26:55

Why is there so many things that I not allowed to stop? Like really sad. How's your foot, by the way?

27:11

Oh, she's gonna go relight. The fire and sit really close to the fire.

27:22

Grayson will check out the Mastodons tasks to see if they might be like the if there's actual like usable ivory in them or the any sort of magic from them. No. And they don't have any treasure or anything like that, actually. Okay. I imagine that becoming undead tainted, their ivory or something, burn it, It's all hollow it.

27:54

Like yeah, full of ice now. Yeah, ice tusks. That was rad That was really scary. But Brad, that was I was really scared. You guys were gonna die right there. I fully knew I panicked. I was like I need to go into negative head points. Why I need shadow clothes?

28:19

Like it's soon as I realized that it had plus 21 to hit on its three natural attacks. Yeah. So that is what I am going to affectionately refer to as casterbate. Yeah. Zio. You need to be here for all of these fights in the north. They're also preparing you because a lot of things have fire vulnerability.

28:45

And this is not the hardest fight. You're gonna face in this book. Not by a long shot Markley. I do. I, I do have a couple fires but boy, it's a good thing that we can't really gear up much more for this for this entire book. This is gonna be hard.

29:03

I can see why people die in this book. It makes me hard. I mean about that. Fireball. I've got scorching ray, Instead of, instead of Zeo hiding behind Sholay was just gonna be all of us hiding behind Zio. I just need things to say that, like, I can reliably hit them.

29:28

That's just, that's only. I feel so bad. How often I crit. You. I have created you more than any other player I've ever played with. I must die once it's, I only DM, I think of all of the characters standing on my screen right now. I think Grayson is the only one that hasn't been crit yet weigh-in also, maybe I think Amigo has I know.

29:57

Koya has, I know Zio has I know in a way has. And I know I have and Richard Grayson has the highest AC of like everybody though. Courtesy of being among which wellness because he's like, never upfront. Yeah, it's It's like you're not only just a monk, though. You're like a Zen Archer and I think you're a whiz base, Sinatra about that, like you don't care about expert thing.

30:24

Yeah, so yeah, like you're actually like really robust. It's awesome. May see normally is 22. If I use stick and action that Casparks, can they can get it to 25 right now. Wow. And then we could get some potions of major armor and get to 29. Unfortunately monk, which is hilarious.

30:49

There is one thing I haven't been calculating my order ability. When I'm fighting defensively gives me gives me like one DR. One DR. / but I'm like the one HP. I'm really need to keep track if we're gonna be nearly dying this much, but I haven't really been legalized here.

31:08

Like even shoko would have been hit by the mastodon. Oh yeah. No that thing. I don't think it could miss me. I don't think it was possible and that's why I spread it's a taxed out because it's undead and it doesn't understand focusing targets. Yeah. I think. Yeah. If it's got like what?

31:28

Like a plus 21, it can only miss pretty much everyone except for maybe no ways might be a little lower on a on the natural one. That's like, yeah. Like noise. I'm tired. Offensive strategy is just well. Can't see me, right? And they can see you and they have heat vision.

31:44

I might have they have fucking heat vision. I'm like, oh, alright. None of that's gonna work. Now, I have a problem. I really think this will not be a problem at level 10. Thank go, cheese. You feel better? The whore frost spirits have heat vision. The frost fallen. Mammoth did not make me feel better.

32:09

That does not make me feel that, Okay? I try this man, he failed his knowledge check on the master bond. Anybody else though you you know you go with it like you tell me they're bigger Siri I will share my knowledge and knowledge. I think a lot of these fights are gonna be super, super cool in the rest of this book.

32:42

It's a lot of interesting information and a lot of hard fights If you need groups. If you guys want Christian to be up in mailing more often, or at least blocking things Think it's just shoko. Wasn't here to be honk Tonk mods. He's so happy to take a beating it.

33:04

I find it very amusing. I've never really seen a tank bard. I mean, I'm trying really hard with the fighting defensively to get AC up and like poke everybody a little bit, actually, the birds left canon. It's, he's not even a glass kid. He's just black. That's He's a glass cannon against damage.

33:24

He's glass cannon against ownie and that's it. And he got you, who is a glass cannon, who makes you feel better will fight Oni in this book. Good, That would be great. They'll be fantastic. No, I hate this. Please stop seats. No more and you got zero. Who is a glass cannon?

33:46

Yes. Absolutely. What is your? What's your like total HP right now? I had 52. I think you might have more health than me.

34:00

Oh, at 60 mainly good. How much up do you have? I have 60 maximum, not enough 86. Okay, so I feel less bad. Shoko's got me beat because he's got a shield. That's why I don't you have higher con Tango. Take the their negative is incon. Oh of course.

34:21

Yeah, they think it you've only got a kind of one, which I had to invest to get. I had to go to 14 to get. So, yeah, because I was like, I'm gonna get punched a lot. I need at least some bonuses to constitution. Why I I agree. I I totally agree Ideally though.

34:43

Like, my AC should just keep scaling, it should stay at least as effective as it is right now, which is a comfort to me because I've worked on that for a long time. So also, I'm also really excited to report that I'm finished. Porting the tournament of the Roof, Phoenix.

35:02

Oh yeah. Do though, we can literally just continue on because this this AP only goes to level 13. I thought they went to 16 13. Oh, it's a very low level AP But yeah, but Ruby Phoenix picks up at level 11s so that's right in the range and then goes to 18 or 20.

35:27

That's perfect. So we can just have tea on adventures. I I would love nothing more than that. That would be cool. Well, I am gonna wander often. Get some foods. No, this was a really fun one. I think we had a super good mix this time a little harrowing to.

35:45

Yeah, it was real nervous, more just care. But I'm saying no more of this. What I'm actually saying is more of this, please. Yeah, there are plenty of dragons and giants and many more undead in your future. Perfect. If we had somebody like dedicated scouting around the caravan, would we have a chance to actually get like a further heads up for these encounters, We are supposed to have those and the wall of them.

36:13

There are also scripted encounters. This was a random encounter that happened. Well you guys were doing your event of gathering a whole new wagon. Yeah. So but there is in the caravan rules which we're kind of flavoring handwaving there is the Scout role which is what we brought the wolf for.

36:33

So yes, and and you do get security checks on some of these things, and then on some of them, you don't and like, on your clear days, your scouts are leaving you around dangers on the days when you have events your scouts admits it. Gotcha. But I think what you're getting at to Grace said, I think if you trust the wolf, you can roll around with the wolf and maybe ever bonus, that is a little bit higher.

37:01

I mean, I don't particularly trust the wolf but racing, nor she is a pretty good scout because he's was the question is, can you won the one, the wolf? It is 1v wanting. The wolf worth higher. Like scouting bonus. I mean, why can't they have both scouting? Just something you can both be scouting.

37:26

That's fine. But basically what I'm saying is we're handwaving the, the traveling system. So the scripted events are just going to be scripted and the clear days are the clear days? It's going cool so far, like, I've enjoyed the flavor that we had today. It was super awesome. The back-to-back dragon flew down and like ravaged.

37:47

The village huts was perfect. I was weirdly awesome. Yeah. The you couldn't foreshadow the dragon any better. If you wrote it, you know me. Oh, I'd like to thank every time we come across an error attacking you settlement like no, I just talks to a couple of them in their native language and is just kind of like.

38:05

So, um, how fucked they're going in the winter of the Dragon right now? So not it's not in great. So what do the air attacking normally speak? Which I think no A is probably. The only one who has it because I don't think I took it and that infarkey are actually very rare languages outside of the North.

38:36

Like, open and scald are more popular than they are. Just because they're, they're larger amounts of people. I can only imagine that some of the area that you would probably be like, okay, your accent is kind of fucking. It's like, yeah, it's from Kessela. I know to try. Yeah.

38:55

They appreciate efforts truth. I'm gonna go to thanks, guys. This was really fun. I look forward to next week. I hope everybody can make it. Stay. Well, I'm so hungry. Bye everyone. Bye. I'm gonna assets. You guys noticed my message for next week, right? You won't be able to make it or you're gonna be late.

39:15

I'll be here, but I, I will be a couple minutes like I work, literally, until three. Just remember, you're the only one who can throw fire. So, you know, put some muscle on it, okay? That's good.
