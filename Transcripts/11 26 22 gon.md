00:31

Braces, actual perception bonus. What the fuck? It is quite best.

00:44

We're actually talking about skills and people's tools and such last week. I mean, you're having such a good possession. Next topic since though. I mean you have like some items and i think the feet for it or something like that. Like yeah. Andrew was the best. You're yeah. You're very, very keen eyed so he can actually shoot the arrows.

01:11

A thousand feet away. Yeah. I mean i built them as a scout kind of character. Because all right, i mean if you look at just the basic zen archer monk stuff. It's and a lot of um, not all but some different archer builds. It's just okay. You can contributing combat and then out of combat.

01:34

What do you do? All yeah, exactly. Um, so he's he's horrible at social stuff but is you know, can do other things to help.

01:51

Yeah, men quite clearly.

01:59

As i have jokes many times before, it's okay guys. We can just leave grace into some of the ape. It'll be fine. It doesn't have to lie, but i think he just a little ply arrows to it.

02:13

I'm not been putting together a backup character idea that i'm quite excited to try out. Mmm. Me, i like looking into classes that you don't see too many people playing. So i've been looking into the hunter and doing a melee hunter with the overrun builds of focusing. A lot on teamwork feats and maybe getting into some like mounted combat stuff of like writing the animal companion but not 100% sure if i want to go that or not, i really want to play.

03:00

Um, so one of one of the character ideas that i have kind of and decide for like if i ever, i have to feel kind of a scouting role for rice or something. Um is actually four star because the forest are hunter. Is so weird i looked at any of the archetypes.

03:27

So i'll answer that sometime. Let me, let me summarize it for you in a sentence. The forester is a hunter that doesn't have an animal companion.

03:41

Yeah, so it trades all the animal companion for um, you know how the ranger gets favorite terrain right? The forester is focused more on bad aspect of it and it's closer therefore to, i guess the ranger guide archetype but the difference is the rather than having favored enemy or anything like that.

04:08

Um, all of their stuff is based on whether or not you can find your enemy in your favorite terrain. So there's some there's some really cool um things in there. And instead of getting combat, sorry teamwork creates you get just straight up, combat feeds to kind of supplement that and i had this, i have a character idea that works with, like, a bit to most aggression actually.

04:35

Um, i have a character called color who is more of a, of a gruff scout kind of person who specializes in archery. And, and that kind of thing. So, um, that was one of the classes that i thought about doing. Like i don't know, i didn't want to play a ranger or um, we needed something that wasn't as you know, full marshal and could do other stuff which punters are like really neat.

05:06

I think they have a lot of room to, to do a bunch of stuff. Yeah, i've always kind of ignored teamwork feats because it's like, well, you know, they have to get somebody else to agree to take them, or, you know, have some way to give them to other people, temporarily or something.

05:22

But then finding out that they just oh, yeah. Your animal. Companion has all the ones that you have and it doesn't need to meet the requirements for them. Yeah. Like oh, okay. Well uh there's quite a few on like doing attack of opportunities based off of each other's actions and getting bonuses.

05:45

When you do those and when charging stuff like that. So it's kind of just looking at all that. Yeah, the the hunter really is the hey guys, here is my character and uh, they do this thing. And here is my pet but it's probably going to out fighter the fighter because that's what the class is supposed to do.

06:11

Um and the cool stuff you can do with like uh i guess there's the um's wrath tree, there's the beastmaster trade. There's obviously brokenberg gambit, all of those kind of opportunist. Uh, treats and stuff like that. Um, i don't typically looking to them myself for having said that the character that i have lined up for whatever plans besides drum that runs about as high game, those pick up teamwork feats.

06:51

Alongside trade this car. So we actually have a paraphon dean twins. Who are doing democrates and doing like joint shenanigans and it looks really fun. The problem is you've got to get a buy-in for it. You know what i mean? Yeah, you gotta kind of have other people agree to like yeah, let's pick some teamwork creeds.

07:16

So you know someone's inquisitor or something i guess. But when i doing that we're just gonna take some feet and have fun with it. Yeah. That's the other one that has the built in. Gives somebody else. Your teamwork feeds, right? Easy inquisitor. Yeah, inquisitor gets some solo tactics which allows you to uh treats anybody in your party is though they have um the teamwork feat for for as long as you can benefit from.

07:40

Yeah, it doesn't benefit them but a benefit to you. Um, they're the one that does that is the, uh, yeah, there's some people on bastard paladin and the best one of my opinion is the, there's an inquisitor to archetype that you can only take if you are a worshiper of nogoba, um, called the, i think it's the keeper secrets and you get to treat.

08:09

You get to target somebody an enemy and rather than everybody on your team been treated as though they have your teamwork reads. You treat that person as though they're an ally for the purposes of your teamwork reads, which doesn't sound like much until you remember, you can take all of the betrayal feats and use those.

08:30

That's funny. I actually built out. Oh cheese. Brother as a possible, backup for this, and also just to like, flush out the character and build them in my brain and he has a, a rogue archetype that does teamwork feeds because he's like part of the mob, Part of the mouth.

08:56

Uh yeah. Unnamed gang, enchiangsha. And minkai is the the character concept that i did was like, the consegulari, uh, rogue archetype and maybe one other one, i can't remember. I have the character sheet somewhere, but it looked really fun. It wouldn't be super great on like a pc character because it cool down on giving other people.

09:18

The teamwork feeds is like not great. It's in line with like, bar and brawler. But you know, for one fight a day getting to amp up a bunch of goons, pretty fun for a bad guy. Sometimes that's all you need. That's why i it's it's why. When i damn sometimes i consider like okay, what if i just make the boss of this thieves guild?

09:47

A ranger. Why would you do that? I'm like, i'm gonna give them allied bombed. You watch our friends, from a bunch of cobalts become when you start giving them your favorite times. Yeah, exactly. Like,

10:05

Yeah, that's always like a cool way to get like a level encounter to, to feel more. Um, like oh wait, no, that actually is a good ability. Oh no, just go full ntg tribal deck on them. Feel like these are just my little weenies and then it's like, these are my scary weenies him.

10:25

Oh look minion. Mastering and i didn't have to play. Someone had to do it. Here you go, buddy.

10:42

Good. It looks like magnets actually responded.

11:15

Has any of our cold weather stuff? Come in handy, yet that we spent a bunch of money on you haven't had to make saves. I would assume that. That's why that's true. You'll need to make saves in the next area but you'll have bonuses. Hell yeah.

11:37

Oh geez, trait bonus to survival, finally coming in clutch.

11:48

No background. Be like, please don't make me. Do 40 times. I don't do that Hawaiian shirt flapping in the breeze. Yep.

12:01

It's pronounced thyroid. But uh, yes.

12:08

You are not wrong.

14:52

Hey everyone. Medical welcome. Hello. Hello. Uh, i'm glad that the time got pushed back today because okay, we needed my help with a bunch of stuff related to cleaning up after thanksgiving. And i couldn't make it until now. So it would have been over an hour late. It's that time of year.

15:15

Everything kind of gets shot to hell from thanksgiving on. I had forgotten that it was thanksgiving gonna be honest, but i hope those of you who celebrate. It had the good season. I think it was, it was nice of good food.

15:41

It's really just an excuse to eat some good food instead of the ovary process. Junk. We have every day real, that's that real food made by real people, instead of government robots. You know, i'm glad that my brain corrected, what i heard because what i first heard was made from real people and now, uh, that's thanksgiving in a more desperate time.

16:16

That's not what you meant. You're not you're not sad that eating. Silent green are slur.

16:27

Build my drink and then we'll get started.

16:44

Have been looking forward to this because i'm really interested to see more of those events with a fan box. Yeah, no spoilers. I missed last week.

16:59

So if you don't watch spoilers or should we not do a recap? Yeah. Just let me come in blind and i'll add lib and we'll see how close i was to the action. So you can, you can, you can just like sell all of the items that would have been good for.

17:13

Okay? Right. That's fine. There's a lot of potions and scrolls and uh, it's none of us. Oh no, i did actually see the thing that got posted. That would have been great for ochi.

17:34

I mean it's still there. We didn't we didn't throw it into the lake or anything. There's a lake spoilers.

17:53

Points and the general vicinity of the map? Yes, there is a lot of ice which is made of water, which usually suggests that there is water nearby.

18:16

Usually in returned, someone do a recap is drizzling was not here. Last time. That's true.

18:28

And while there are many encounters, a lot of story happened too. Dang.

18:36

I guess i can give a crack. Um, though we started off uh, On the trail, on the, on the river brighten up north to a village from, which we were going to set out on. We'll secret path up through the, the boreal wastes was that it Um control all the way back.

19:10

I wanted to say the borian tundra, but no, that's wow.

19:20

Rip.

19:24

He was. So the government took him out for spoiling it. My headphones are not behaving and i can't tell what's wrong with them. I just i might have to replace them.

19:57

Anyway, across the north, he has a secret path. That is separate for the path that people usually take that, he thinks we'll get us across safer and away from anyone who might be waiting for us. Uh and so we're setting out on our way to that along the way we found a bunch of villages raised to the ground by a white dragon who had been eating everyone.

20:32

I don't say his name was a pause or something like that, absol. Something. Uh, let me pull up my notes. Not was, it was be something. Wasn't that? The written down as big sunbag. I think that's not the other dragon, isn't it? The white dragon. Anyways after that we then met another dragon, a silver dragon, a good dragon who was chasing the white dragon and wanted us to

21:12

Tell him where the dragon had went. If we had seen him and we gave him what knowledge we had and he thanked us with a magical music box that will summon him. If we ever need help, he asked us to please own to please. Prioritize using it for if we encounter the white dragon though.

21:35

And then after that, we ran into, we found an obelisk planted in the ice. That was guarded by a yukiyona, a snow woman and several ghouls. We'll know. I schools, i forget what they're exactly called.

22:00

And they were scary for all of five seconds before grace and did a bajillion damage to her and killed hernisting around.

22:12

Um, fireballs being fireballs and all that.

22:24

Oh, is is right coming today or he's supposed to?

22:36

Um, and we discovered that the obelisk appeared to be planted in the ground recently. Like it's not. It wasn't a very old oveless even though it was made to look old. Like it had um, it had writing on it. That was of an ancient ancient tien, but the stone itself was fairly new.

23:14

And that's about where we left off. I'm trying to think what major story thing we missed. I missed here because you said there was big story happened. Anyone want to help?

23:35

Generally trying to remember we talked a lot about the care that caravan path across the ice and look at the mat quite a bit and and all that.

23:57

Yeah. Like, as far as my memory is serving my currently with my threadband outs. Um, most of what we talked about last session was basically just logistical um, to whether we were going one way or another or like we've passed the erotaki at this point, right? Because it all wacked currently about to go to their attacky settlements around.

24:27

Here you are in fact on your way, to it. Yeah, so we're not quite on the high. I well we're on the highest but we're not out across the that's what i'm forgetting. The name i was at the boreal waste across the like a very north, the highest actually having a hard time finding where it told me the three regions now.

24:49

The high ice is the big Ridge and then the boreal expanse is the center, but i can't remember what the outside ring is the something highlands

25:04

That makes. Um yeah so we're currently on the last leg of trying to get across the high ice right now so that we can descend down into the memorial expense and go through. Oops path. Um which is supposedly less well-traveled and known to other individuals and therefore hopefully should not be a wash with the potential blessings caught and quote from the the only of the five slots but there was a fuck off dragon in the way.

25:40

So, you know,

25:45

I'm sure that won't be a problem.

25:50

Sure. Oh, she can handle a dragon, you know. It. Look at those thin arms crazy. Can i'm just going to watch from like here and stealth behind the rock.

26:14

It's going to be funny, watching OG challenge a dragon all dramatic. Like and then watches and makeup. Kill, steals it. Yeah.

26:27

Oh, that was the other thing. Um, the caravan has the absolute joy of being. Um, when we went out looking for a Yukiana, um, we were assaulted by yet more frost-based, undead and then and then an arctic bullet, which demolished that's what i remember. Okay. Fucking demolished princess over here, which was uh, but shouldn't happen, so that wasn't a problem.

27:06

Any so more scary dragons, we almost died to more ice undead. We figure out, we figured out where we're going and then we fought an undead ice lady with like goal servants. Yeah. And then we were attacked by um, a frozen very into the lamb. Chop that's terrifying. What did OT do?

27:31

This one time was i napping? Now, uh, you were out scouting with chaletu. Oh cool. She really likes me. I'm sure behind in cow's guard. I mean, that was unnecessarily cruel. No, no. We just oh, she's just like sitting by the uh, like the the waiting for bust sign like checking his watch and being like they were supposed to pick me up by now.

28:00

We left him in cal's guard. Yes. And i'm just still waiting at that other gate. Yeah, we thought we picked up our two. We'd actually picked up a scarecrow. That sounds like a bunch of really scary fights though. I'm glad that i wasn't there to suck up all the healing, for them honest.

28:24

Um, we did. Yeah, we did. We did get you a nice kimono though, that that should help you out of it. That's true. What's it do? I can't remember you get uh super special samurai. Only crit bonus when you create uh that does cool stuff like permanently deafen someone i think does more damage.

28:44

Question mark, Nate. Do thumbs up. So, jane region is not loading for me.

28:58

Are you all in there and forge? Yeah, i'm in game. I actually see you in here too. I've been trying to reload and get in but it's uh it's not been letting me in so far. You do in theater of the mind of this week. Just put me out of my misery.

29:20

Now, if we started doing Pathfinder is not the system to do that with

29:38

So, where are we at this moment, narrator? Boom, we will take you to the map of the crown of the world because you guys also found that beautiful gold, astral lab and a map of the crown.

30:05

That's right. Off of, oops, didn't rival rival guide. But currently, you guys are making your way here towards the village of ikaliat.

30:26

And so, this dotted line is this the boreal route that the wolf was telling us about. And then, this solid line is the one that everybody else takes. No, the dotted one is actually the normal path of agony and the solid is wolf route. The solid is that all throughout?

30:50

Yes. Off. Not the wolf. Okay. For sure, i thought the wolf was giving us pro tips. Animal only pro tips.

31:03

Interdasting.

31:24

I think it was asked by. I'm just now understanding i'm about why we couldn't just go around the ice and i think all said that it technically could, but there's a lot of warring tribes and such that aren't particularly friendly. And so it'd be a lot of combat stuff.

31:46

Yeah. The high ice is not a safe space. It's also occurring to me right now. As i look at this map again for like the second or third time, why a compass would not be enough to get you across this area because you would get about halfway. And then the, depending on where you were, the compass would just be spinning or pointing left or pointing, right?

32:07

You would have to use uh the constellations to get you from point A to point B up here. Uh, fun fact that you will soon. Learn, once you are in the boreal. Expands compasses do not work here. Yeah, they'll be doing some funky stuff. When you got this far, north,

32:33

Like it soon. As you get into this big old bowl up here, your compass, just start spinning, but you're still like a week away from there.

32:48

All right, og pops the cassette into koias caravan and on the road again by Willie. Nelson starts playing. We should just ask the dragon to like carry us across. Yeah. How much gold to skip this part of this book on the road again? Okay, we also did the forting the cars go last time.

33:16

We forwarded, we did not report our wagons of drafts. We are we are on the other side of the river now.

33:28

Oh, she did get dysentery though. I'm sorry about that. God damn it and all seven with my rattlesnake. Yeah it was so badass, he bit the snake back and it died. Yep. Oh, don't go saying that. Nobody's gonna claim. It's true. What the fuck are you talking about? Of course.

33:51

It's fucking true. Pretty goddamn nature. You are those damn arctic rattles he didn't even he didn't even like bite it like in half or anything. He just bit it and then it died from Grayson's, venom

34:09

Key injected, his blood alcohol, content into the snake and instantly died.

34:17

What a waste of good alcohol. I need to top back off after that. Wait, why did i say that? Like, arctic rattlesnakes would be a weird thing and fucking pathfinder land. There are absolutely probably snow snakes or sometimes, which makes no doubt, very little physiological sense, as they're cold-blooded typically but welcome to fantasy.

34:42

How the dragons are doing up here. I wouldn't, i mean, i guess they have magical inherent. There are. Um, there's silver and white dragons. They're, they're cold type dragons. They're also, there are the, i don't know if these are in pathfinder or just D&D. I don't know if dd has a trademark on them but there's the um the ice serpents that like have that do fire damage.

35:09

Oh no. I know another one you're talking about. I don't know if they haven't remora morads. Yeah, they do dungeons and dragons. Actually has very little intellectual property on any of their monsters because they're all taken from mythologies. What's what's some exceptions? Like the big ones like section. Yeah.

35:34

Something something bigger. Yeah, my players and beholders which which are very dungeons and dragons things, but see the, the dragon types that was come up with by someone who doesn't work for, are they do work for blizzard again now. So, It's a dragon lands thing. It's coming back in.

35:58

But that might actually bring take me back to with the guns and dragons. I love dragon lands, anyways. You are? I completely lost the train of what i was doing. So, you have reached the clips of the high ice and you begin traveling. Along them. While you look for the village of ikea ikaliat which is built partly into the cliff face itself.

36:34

Boom.

36:41

So if we're like on this edge that they're near the cliff edge, we just like able to look out over it and just see like endless ice. No. See, you've got to go up to the top of the clips and then back down because there is it's more like a plateau that surrounds the pole.

36:59

Uh, okay.

37:05

So, the the people who call this place home, you what were they called again? Uh, the erosaki, the varki, uh, some opens, some arithms. So this land is like um, like that. They're all like indigenous tribes. Like they're not like a here from other countries, they're not like leftover from some country that used to rule here.

37:38

Oh no. No, no. They're at least in terms of their tacky. They're broken down into individual tribes. I only know one of them which is strangely interactive but yeah they're all like separate it out actually don't know which ones are in control. This far to the the other stand side, it's not the quirky, right?

38:08

They don't actually give me a tribe name. Just the cities that they live in because they actually have towns and cities up here. Let me see who rules achileat. And limo.

38:28

Was literally just looking at a kill yet. Where did it go?

38:36

Um,

38:42

One more app.

38:47

A killiart, uh,

38:57

Hello, welcome. Welcome.

39:07

I'm not into the overhanging cliffs of Ella alasek Ridge at the southern.

39:17

I'm gonna take a guess and say that it's probably the eek of it. It literally doesn't say anywhere. That's weird.

39:36

Yeah, i don't get any names for any of the tribes which to be fair. This may have been when they started expanding the north. So they didn't have those yet.

39:51

People living older, AP it is, people are not didn't come out until 28 12, so that makes sense. So i figured like, y'all know i i'm gonna be a big distracted, a little bit, first thing i happened by get back, i got home and open up escortis. I got a message from a friend of mine, from a crowd that on one left by arc.

40:14

If asking me when i get home, if i could take care of the babies, make sure they're okay. And so i'm gonna be doing two jobs at once on by this game in art,

40:30

Okay. Oh, i won't be doing much on that. Just, you know, making sure the babies on arc it, archived involved are fed and still alive. That's fine. Just like uh try to pay attention. Oh i i am painted.

40:50

So i guess. Should we get bowling? We're good to go. Yes, we should. Gosh. Darn it. I do like rolling these event dice.

41:05

Well, actually.

41:09

Now, we have some scripted events. Ah,

41:19

As you guys are making your way along the cliff face. Following it towards achiliad. Is this like a stare or like a climb that we're doing? No, you're following the juices, right? Okay, you're traveling. Adjacent to the cliff base. Following a inlet of the cars. Go river. So you constantly have water nearby as well.

41:50

Okay, clear, i need you to stop going immediately to young version of you. They gave her a flip token and regret it. She has a preference.

42:17

Maybe i know she go ahead and rearrange. You, you guys, however, you like and walking order distance. We're going that way. Dissing way. You are going this way and do anything. Because we are currently paused. That's true.

42:45

We're going that way. Hey 43, perception check. You want to go in front and i'll go right behind you.

43:00

One just one well then we'll be don't, they?

43:10

I'll stay right here at on my side. We could do two by two. I don't see a reason. We can't do that either. Is now it looks like you're um it goes on through we are on me. Oh yeah. Almost like that's the question of the entire, i know.

43:34

I know, mr. President's wife. Oh, this is, uh, this is, this is they should rename several days of travel. This is, they should be a name. This six six book. Escort quest. The entire AP is an escort quest. Oh gee. I'm are you paying attention about and to be fair, no one really needs the role perception as it happens.

44:05

You hear what? Sounds like a echoing draconic roar a what? It sounds like a dragon roar, you know. Whoa. Dear. Like, i don't know. I haven't ready. And also a large cat roar. And then the strange one is, would sound like a very large bleeding ram, okay, i put away the box.

44:42

I think i know what this is so good and that's when the rumbling starts. I hate this and you see all of the snow in the ice up the clip side. Start to shutter. All right, run.

45:04

We need to start running you think? Yes, i can't run the world is fast, but more than anything you need to rule. Reflex saves. Because you the only one here, who might be able to outrun an avalanche is grayson. Well, do we have any way to maybe counter or have like in what have you make a wall or something?

45:29

I just roll the reflex. Save. Okay. Oh man. I know there's a an arcane spell uh that's all about our avalanche stuff atmosphere. It takes around though for the avalanche to start and finish.

45:54

I mean, i could cafe spell and then move the same time.

46:01

Grace. And yeah, i mean you're all three. You can't really do much about it. It's all right. You can probably outrun it. That's very you ninjas. Might be able to outrun it too.

46:27

Always forget that you guys have like key point ability. I mean, technically, i could probably not want it to the spell. You are more than welcome, the dimension slide away and save yourself while your friends are buried in snow.

46:45

If you're also cast image indoor he could just teleport directly up into the air and like dodge the avalanche and then come back down on top of us. Very true.

47:05

Boom. Oh initiative. Sorry, i don't have i don't have no problem. Damn it. I don't know why it rolled my initiative twice but i'll go with whichever one needs to be rolling. Everyone's initiative twice. Or there are other copies of you guys on this map. There are that sounds like exactly what it is because i wasn't on the last map and everybody else was except for, maybe it's like nope zero.

47:37

Yeah. And we're, we're all in the initiative, tracker twice.

47:49

And i remove that one.

48:16

Else is on here twice, being very fun.

48:26

That's the right one. Yes.

48:35

All right, i'm still on that. Quite, i'm still on there, twice, by the way.

49:05

So uh, things are getting a little dicey.

49:12

Or a developed maybe avalent has started. You have one round. Three act, one. Round of iraq. Okay.

49:28

And here, what i can do in this round Zuki.

49:58

Well okay. I'll first cast a spell and amigo.

50:20

And then i try, i will start booking it.

50:29

Do you tell her that she can fly? Like, by the way you can, you can find now

50:39

Um, uh, which way can i i'm allowed to go, technically.

50:50

That way, just fly teleport, 60 120 feet up in the air and then just don't do anything else.

51:00

And fall back down. 120 feet, i can only technically teleport, 70 feet, the air.

51:14

Oh no, technically only 73.

51:22

And in Orlando next time. So we have a fallen on stuff. It's not comfortable. I want to tell you a story about a man named fizzbin.

51:38

But i i i've started running that's why i got

51:49

Probably won't show up or not run it.

52:01

So, amigo kind of kicks her feet a little bit and goes 60 feet up. Wow, amazing never flown before.

52:21

Here. Doesn't she get by his move recipe? Doesn't she get a bonus movement? Speed? From koi is travel. Yeah. Yes. She does so like you move 70 feet up. Yeah. And you hear what sounds like a very uncomfortable stomach noises. Well, that's that's a great crocken idea. There zero.

52:46

I'm gonna grab a beverage. I'll be right back. I mean i won't start on myself. That's yo i well aggression, please shoot whatever inevitably comes and tries to pluck her out of the sky.

53:07

I mean, we've heard noises. We don't see any creature good. Yeah, i don't trust that. That you want, who is like i and if if i trusted everything, i saw much of my life would be completely just, you know, unexistent.

53:44

Everything.

53:50

So, it looks like up ahead would be clear of the oncoming. Avalanche. Could be why it is personal. Take the run action and go 200 feet forward. Obviously, the map doesn't go that far. So there's only here, you're out of the way of the ability.

54:24

Run is three times our movement speed, right? Four times, unless you have the run, Pete, then it's five times, it's three, if you're in medium and medium armor. Yeah, christians thinking is he can't come back to help dig people out if he's also trapped under it as well. The EGTFS good.

54:54

Um which reminds me i see a lot of buffs on folks, that may not be on, turn up your inspired courage their coya

55:08

Boom, major armor travel domains. Maybe.

55:16

Just movement actually give us 10 feet of five speed. He gives you plus 10 of all forms of movement as long as you have it. Um and yes Grayson you see this comes loping off the top of the clips and take wing.

55:36

He'll shout out a warning to everyone, um so i'm guessing other people considered too.

55:47

Where's my, i knewit t-shirt and as it flies down.

55:57

It unleashes a terrible breath from the white dragon's head. It's actually a much smaller com than i thought it was. I didn't roll the damage one's like,

56:17

Wow. That's it's super small. Only 20 foot come.

56:28

Yo, i don't see any reason for it. Not to overall the damage. Oh, i put it in critical damage. Bonus. Well, heck

57:05

There we go. Why isn't the animation working?

57:16

So, just no way angry thing. Uh, it looked like you both made it and they'll have damage if you don't have a vision, no damage if you got it.

57:32

If you know, i just kind of like oh shit disappear. A flash steps back. Okay, i don't like you at all. And the enormous beats of the chimera's wings, sends all the freshly powdered snow swirling up into the air.

58:09

Rip again.

58:19

Ripn piece.

58:42

Is this a flurry of low visibility snow wing effect. All concealment that's so rad. Wow, for everyone. Who's in the cloud.

59:00

Nearly that includes you. Full concealment full concealment.

59:13

Unless anyone has those nice goggles? The length of fog cutting like a special item that we got last session or the snow blindness goggles. Oh no. The the lenses of fog cutting. I see, i see. I mean, if you have eight grands of spare, i love her. Yes, you guys.

59:39

Didn't Elf Garden.

59:46

You can skip my turn. Thanks. And i'll get back to you when this encounters of it. Huh.

01:00:01

Wait, what?

01:00:07

The way is doing a cry.

01:00:14

Probably won't work. The was the chimera still airborne when it flapped or is this the land with about 10 feet up still? So it's currently as we saw it. Levitating using fly. That is correct, makes sense.

01:01:08

Sorry, just back home. Um, honestly like yeah but whatever, i'm gonna deal with us.

01:01:37

So what can we do about this? Um well i guess i could make a check to see if what i know about chimera is on my turn. You see if maybe like i think the cloud will go away soon.

01:01:54

Okay, possibly, so happy, you're not doing anything.

01:02:05

I think she said she's not a call and she had to tell you. Oh, gee. Okay.

01:02:21

Hold on one second. I'm so sorry.

01:02:34

Tutorial. Okay. Oh, g is going to as a move action use. Uh, he just kind of focuses for a second. Oh gosh, i'm so bad at this.

01:03:03

And he's going to gain a thing with that as a move action. And then i can use. I can substitute a standard action to then move after doing that as a move action, right? Okay. So then we will spend, let's see here.

01:03:29

Going to spend a key point, it's going to make a hand sign. Like, he's seen the way do a bunch of times, but probably wrong and then move very fast very far.

01:04:03

Lucia. Oh, she explodes out of the world of snow in front of me. Looking at it. Yeah, he gets way over there and, uh, i think that's gonna be a turn. That was the swift. A standard in a move. Oh, she does not want to be near that thing but he's keeping an eye on what happens.

01:04:24

He may try to run back in depending on if he sees a makeup come out you trusts oh he should actually be able to see her because Pythagoras she's pretty high up and that's like a 30 foot. That's a 30 foot ish dust storm of snow and he should be able to see her above it.

01:04:40

So he's yes. Way about it. Cool, cool. That's my turn. Uh the wing beats give way to drum beats as she'll go begins his body performance. Everybody gets inspire competence and smart courage. Other what level is that now?

01:05:03

Well, six.

01:05:50

Be right back. My food just guys.

01:06:06

Okay, sorry about that. That's always good to hear, when

01:06:14

Big olds priority, one security incident kicks off. Oh, fun stuff. Not really sounds like a lot of fucking work. I'm gonna have on Monday.

01:06:31

Do you have to go now? But like, i don't have to do anything but they're obligated to inform me that something potentially might have happened and their currently implementing fixes to make sure that it cannot happen. If that makes sense. I love the i get the same thing in my industry.

01:06:50

Sometimes with it's like something exploded. We can't do anything about it until monday. If we just wanted to let you know. Well, okay, so it's not that they can't do anything. Engineers are currently on site texting the problem and remotely literally holding solutions to put into the database as we speak.

01:07:11

The problem is that from a legal standpoint, they have to report it to a security manager. That's me. So i'm like, okay and start. Is there any chance that we had there to loss which is the important question to, which they're like no and like well okay do you want to maybe find the fuck out and get back to me like

01:07:42

Um,

01:07:52

Video.

01:07:57

Oh, by the way. Didn't know. I do anything on her turn or just take a. You can just make an assumption that either. She use the concealment to do a stealth check or just used invisibility. Um, and it's probably waiting to shank the shit out of this thing because, you know,

01:08:23

Everybody wants to go ahead and move if you're going. Yeah. What why would i move to further into a cloud? Like that's about it because what you would have done is probably tried to climb as quick to try and stab the thing. But can't do that because you can't see the clay can't see it now.

01:08:36

So, pretty much none of the things that i would have done would have since there. And this is no way, she doesn't think very well. So that's fair. All right. Theo. Okay, come back. So what? What's going on? This is the top of the round. As the avalanche hit us, the avalanche does hit now.

01:09:00

So i need reflect saves from everyone who hasn't made one yet gracious out of the way about 14 or later. So, i probably get 30, you get buried. Am i also out of the way? Boom. Yes, i got a 25 on my reflex. It's like gonna be good enough.

01:09:25

Any to not be buried. Yes, into avoid damage. Oh damage. Oh that's sad. Well it's not like the avalanche was going to softly caress you as it came down the mountain. That was it? Good.

01:09:49

Yeah, you're definitely out of the range energy.

01:09:54

Two. Three 11 cold damage. Oh,

01:10:06

Oh yeah.

01:10:18

Half damage. Apologies. Did you need another saving group? No, it's the same one that you would have made earlier.

01:10:30

Uh, so also, if we say, if we take half damage, okay, back flips, over an avalanche.

01:10:40

But what kind of damage is it, is it just cold image this cold damage.

01:10:49

All right. Theo kitchen. So i'm currently buried. You are. How much? So, uh, enough to tell them to take a pull around action to dig yourself out, or you could blindly teleport a huge thing, but this is, i have to be able to see rub going. But let's say you could cast the engine door, take the fourth level, spelled those, i would have

01:11:27

Well, it sounds like you're spending around. Digging yourself out. Oh, i don't know why. I had a Mako made the save. She's currently 70 feet in the air. Yeah, bye. So this isn't really an apple inch. It's more like a bit of snow fell on us. I mean that would have murdered some commoners.

01:11:48

Create 3d6 would kill mostly. Okay. All right. So we will give you any of the the grappled or helpless conditions or anything like that video. Since you're spending your time digging yourself out i mean i mean at the same time i still take that knowledge. Check to find out what this thing was.

01:12:09

Uh, yes, for those that haven't knowledge or comma.

01:12:15

When helatar Khana we slipped my mind.

01:12:23

Uh, it is an arctic chimera Doesn't really differ very much from a regular chimera except it's got a white dragon head and

01:12:42

Some of you will have seen a chimera like this in breath of the righteous. Yeah, kind of bringing this one is not mythic.

01:12:55

Some very nasty noises had it been. It's gonna be real party, would die. Yeah, if i remember, right? Not another and i don't know, maybe we get someone else who could one round the fucking thing.

01:13:16

Umiko yelps, as she tries to descend back to where she can helpful what we wanted from the archiving. Check. How long does this cloud effective? There's last, this is not an effect of the creature so much is what it was doing with its wings with the fresh powder from the snow.

01:13:34

So it wings are buffeting up the snow into a cloud. Okay. Yes, it's not magical at all. It's mundane. It is something the writers of this AP thought was a clever tactic for a chimera in the middle of the snow. Good times, right? They're not wrong, they're not wrong.

01:13:57

I appreciate the notion of like of course players can deal with this. They, they bought an eight thousand gold item at level seven, right? Right. So don't want to come. So, when it comes to the basics of a chimera, uh, so the dragon head breathe at us. Do the other two.

01:14:14

Heads doing anything special, they bite and ram at you. Okay. Uh, cameras are not overly complicated month. Thirds. Uh, they have sent dark vision.

01:14:33

They're evil. This one. Do they have? Well, do they have snake, tails? It does kind of have a weird thing tail. It does not, this particular chimera has two bite attacks, agor attack and two claw attacks. Uh, it does not have reach, which is a thing. Everyone should be happy about but it's full attack.

01:15:02

Can be quite deadly as it gets to make all of those.

01:15:12

Boom. So amigo, almost flames into the ground, which he descends and she has no ranks and fly whatsoever. Koya cast the spell and walked over here and touches shoko locks over here and touches the miko and touches over no way. Can you even see me bye and knows where you are?

01:15:43

Jack correct. I remember i took this, i had this return on salt though, all throughout like the first few levels because it would be a the thing, those little pudding demons did with the chicken. Okay, die isn't very bad. I forgot about that spell action. Path. That's not seen that in a while.

01:16:09

I don't need help that one so you guys may turn on your scene visibility

01:16:24

Uh, on your census tab. Oh, so that's

01:16:32

You're right, possible effect. Yeah. The the green. Oh, this is quite nice. It's like fell fire. I like it.

01:16:53

I like negative exposure. No way as well. Hey, it's in. Since he can't see the cruiser, he's going to do the run action back. And about where burst the limit of it being safe as far as the avalanche is concerned. They're like to ochi or a little past him.

01:17:18

Oh, the the evolution is finished but there is a typical terrain sort of amount of snow over here now. Okay. So he'll do a actually i'll just do a double move or no. Yeah actually yeah a run and he'll get to next to ochi and then stop. So it's not a, he doesn't go the full distance but it's a little more than a double move that mean go ahead and oh, i don't see invisibility anymore but it disabled, i can't see no way or the camera anymore collector token.

01:17:59

That's like it and i still have seen invisibility on.

01:18:06

I can see their tokens whenever tokens selected.

01:18:15

Okay, now i see it.

01:18:20

I don't know what changed, but

01:18:31

And of course, it's white.

01:18:41

Change the line color. So this happy blue so pass, that line is where the difficult turned begins. Okay, so he'll run up to, he'll run up to it and it's the right here. Yeah.

01:19:15

Um, racing. You ignore partial concealment. Correct. Yes, but not total. You may turn yours on now as well.

01:19:37

So, on your attribute tab, you want to go down the senses and over to the edit note or edit button and just click on scenesis ability. Oh, isn't that our neck of the pub shows of like being able to make shelter? Yeah.

01:20:01

Boom.

01:20:07

Deo.

01:20:12

Gonna be a hit 14 points of damage. Yep. Oh, you may also turn on yours.

01:20:30

Of percentage? Yes, because it is now right next to you. Sort of still five feet in the air. Bottom lying. Flying jothamine and to move this tile.

01:21:16

Today to this, to be on the whole thing.

01:21:24

Probably that mean. Double check. Uh, i check the hub of feet. That seems to be what this is doing.

01:21:38

Course, it's not a complete in here.

01:21:44

Cheers.

01:21:54

And now i'm looking at games loading. So sorry, one's like, but to be fair, he just finished this turn.

01:22:10

I am totally. Fuck. Yeah, fine. We've got all our turns. Next, the zeal threaten things. Do you give? No life linking here.

01:22:24

I don't have a weapon out so no we don't. Um, please give me a controller. Tilton. Thank you that i fucking stuff again coming up until i i just had to pull my weapon and get out of it.

01:22:50

To see it.

01:22:55

There's no able to delay her turn until after a show goes, so he can run forward and give her flanking. Okay? So, oh crap. It's supposed to be 60. Now, i is going to get and her ability to lock this thing anywhere. Um so you want you are free to to do as you please close.

01:23:19

All i'm being very terrible. I was messing with character sheet stuff. What is this blue line? All right, that's where difficult terrain begins. Gotcha. Okay, okay. So more details here, the hemispherical cloud is 60 foot wide, 60 feet wide. The winds generator can snuff torches small campfires to those lanterns and other small open plains of non-magical origin.

01:23:52

Clear vision within the cloud is limited to 10 feet, creatures have concealment at 15 to 20 feet. 20%, miss chance and at 25 feet or more creatures have total concealment for that mishands. And opponents cannot use sight to locate the creature.

01:24:10

Okay, so

01:24:15

Grayson, i think you are within still

01:24:28

Oh no. You need to be 10 feet closer before you concealments removed again, but you know where it moved to this round. So you can just scooch on forward.

01:24:43

Let me fix the tile size.

01:25:02

A huge radius. What? What plus 60 foot radius, 60 foot, radius, and within 25 feet of it, you only had it only gets partial concealment from 25 feet. Inside it gets partial and 25. Feet outwards, it gets full bet. If you're more than 25 feet away from it, it gets full against you.

01:25:35

If you're within 25 feet, it gets partial. Can we get an additional aura to denote that? Or is the previous one? Good for that 5, 10, 15, 20? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Heck, what a creature? What an encounter?

01:25:58

I i just thought that this is difficult to ransom my son's over anyway and i fully expect this thing to be dead before i take a swing. So, oh, we'll see. Oh, gee, uh, does what about the, uh, the travel domain movement? Yeah, you would have to be 20.

01:26:21

Um, yeah, this is interdasting.

01:26:33

Can i get TLDR on difficult terrain? For someone who hasn't played through it actually, ever they ever reach, put it each feet foot and the decimal correct considered. Hey, tell me your movement. Through it. And you can't five foot step. No roles or anything like that, though. No, no, no.

01:26:58

Okay, i gotta put shoco five foot over to the left here because he couldn't have five foot sector earlier. Interesting.

01:27:20

Okay. Oh cheese. Going to move there. I think it would be five, 10, 15, and then does it begin. And that square. It begins with that score. Yes. Okay. So, five, 10 15 25, 35 45. Heck, yeah. Well, gets it right there. And now you can turn on your scene invisibility.

01:27:46

I don't do. I have that buffs. No, it'll be in your sense tab and my wear. So on your Android, go down the senses. And then over to the little edit button, you click on scene, visibility

01:28:11

Okay. Oh, she's gonna try and throw a shuriken at it. We'll see how this goes. I don't have the attack on. You're gonna get a minus 4 for the the wins. Oh, in addition, everything else. Minus four for wins cheese and rice. Man cheese in rice.

01:28:37

Okay, and it's already outside of my rain and range increment by one, so it would be minus six. Okay, so i'm going to write that in minus 6 and he's still got 20% concealment. Okay, okay. So this encounter is a lot more difficult than i thought. It was gonna be.

01:29:07

Yeah, it's a little plotting so far, but okay, we get into, so roll d100. Yeah, i'll roll after your attack. Okay, well i rolled into 21. I don't see an attack. Oh, i'm sorry. I had it on sale for all. How do i make it public? Uh, just right.

01:29:28

Click on it. Okay, there we go. It hits. Dang it hits. That was actually kind of worth it. I'm not mad about that.

01:29:47

You're sure can sinks into it and it releases a roar of anger. I think that's going to be my turn, then that way. Way better than i could have expected. Yep, go. All right. So, i should be starting five foot over here, because if i was stopped illegal earlier and so 5, 10 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 40, i could get to there is the inspire courage to correct.

01:30:14

I just plugged in the level on it and assume that it was going to be right. But that's yeah. Okay, cool. Uh so i can see it from here. You should be able to see it anyways because you got action path. Okay. All right. Then.

01:30:35

He will be making me any quick. Uh, wisdom save.

01:31:14

Stuff and that will be my turn.

01:31:21

Already video. I'm making a concentration fact. They cast defensible.

01:31:29

Probably a good idea.

01:31:34

I think i make it. You do unless you're casting a ninth level fell. No, gonna hit that thing of boom, share.

01:31:55

Oh, okay. Uh, it makes anything Let's go fix a damage. Okay, then it also makes the save against moral terror image. I think it's movement.

01:32:16

Yeah, damage.

01:32:25

And i believe that bumped him up to panic, right? Yeah.

01:32:47

And of course, i will spend in our endpoint.

01:32:55

On the camera to permit. Imagine slide.

01:33:03

And be away.

01:33:09

He have disappeared to me since he did that. Me too. You have your token selected? Yeah, i still have OG selected.

01:33:25

You have to click on the board every once in a while, perfect.

01:33:34

It's fine. I still know where it goes. Turn.

01:33:40

On.

01:33:53

Mmm. Something, uh, just quick terminology question around is all of our turns, right? Correct. Okay. One, two that will move. I just saw that first time. Each round part of mortal terror and that, oh, that makes a small significantly worse than i thought. It's no, it's actually really good.

01:34:20

Okay. It means the rapidly claims the fear chart. It's already been trying to run on its turn but i know i know that spell is amazing. I don't know it. I is really good. I just thought it was broken because i thought it was like one broken. I i thought one full attack action from no way.

01:34:40

Would bring it all the way up so panic, but i don't know what around. Nobody's mad about anything, no one, no one's mad about it. But here's the fun thing with model tarot. If you have the right build, it would, no, i just isn't built for intimidation if she was, um, yeah.

01:34:58

That would be exactly what would be happening right now. It would go to cowering and then it would get crew to grad. Yeah, multiplayer is good. Is it's not going to here.

01:35:26

So if a monster please combat with us, do we get experience for that? You still technically win the encounter. Okay, everything Also, yeah, the month the camera is still and visible. To me recent moves 10 feet forward, which at least uh ohs it. Yeah. Yeah. For some reason, interacting with the screen reveals it and then i'll just take

01:36:11

Just like a single shot. I can sit. And is there any wind penalty minus four?

01:36:32

The 20% chance, he ignores that what he does doesn't he?

01:36:41

Of the tribe. Go through precise fat. All right, anything else for you? Grayson, uh, not bad. Is it?

01:36:59

All right, amiko and noe, both get attacked opportunity as it takes off straight into the air.

01:37:13

Big scary monster scared of little noodle armed, fox man.

01:37:21

It's good. They're talking about them.

01:37:26

Oh yeah, this is Pathfinder. You're not scared of a certain of a particular creature. It's just a condition.

01:37:47

There's nothing else. So, don't believe the fucking bath. Oh my god. Yeah, i was with medicine check.

01:38:07

That fire damage though.

01:38:17

And,

01:38:24

They'll have the dragon subtype, right?

01:38:29

Instead of the dragon's head, okay?

01:38:36

So yeah, speaking of bleeding to death, when does it take that bleed damage beginning of its round of its round? So, next turn,

01:38:54

Fly off and then drop out of the sky. I it does. In fact take the run action up and then yes, followed out of the sky because it had two hp left. Just like, yeah. And it took so it's my speed is 50. It flies a hundred feet up takes four bleed damage.

01:39:32

Oops. Nope, there's no way tell us that this is going to happen so that we clear in case it falls on one of us. Or does she think that would be really funny? She has no way of knowing the visibilities kind of poor. You'll be hard to tell. I would think that it's gonna drop dead, you know, she's currently holding a flank of like chimera scale for that is now just a slight on the ground and kind of looks up and goes uh well, it'll die of blood loss eventually.

01:40:09

Oh, and then it just falls to the ground and blows most of that fresh powder in every direction creating another brief, whirling storm of snow, that settles and consumably actually dies from breaking. Its neck. I did. It did actually your bleed damage, knocked it unconscious and then the 100 feet fall background.

01:40:30

I was gonna say the pathfinder falling damage. Definitely did that one in? Whoops, nicely done. I did not like that thing.

01:40:48

I mean, circle will approach the corks. And say, i mean, depending on how much of this thing is go, uh, we did just get a lot of meat for the caravan, you'll hear like mutton.

01:41:06

I definitely do. I can't move my token because we have to end combat

01:41:17

Within that nightfall channel. Yeah, no. It was actually trying to get everyone in it and i thought everyone was so everyone's getting that channel much, i applied coya.

01:41:35

We certainly always have an interesting time. Could it be less interesting? I would not appreciate you sign up foreign. That's what you're signed up for, isn't it? Okay, let me rephrase interest, then. Yes, lethal. Mmm not to me or makeup. So for those of you who made your checks on cameras, you know that much like dragons, they keep hordes.

01:42:10

Oh yay. Uh, shoko will commune with birds again. Oh no, you can see it's cave now of the avalanches, cleared, the class. Oh she's just gonna be like, what's up, man? You wanted to talk? That's but they would go up to kayak like after shouldn't pass. Dear does hoji know that with his like low teen role about the hordes.

01:42:45

Uh, did you get above a 17? I think i got like a 13 or something. I can't remember what i rolled. Yeah, 13. No. Unfortunately but yet it is a relatively easy climb up to the cave and like a monkey.

01:43:09

Uh, it's at the top, which is about 60 feet up. Oh, okay, i can just teleport up to it. If they climb check and oh it's only a 20 after the avalanche whereas before it was a 30. So,

01:43:38

The drop 10 feet of snow on us, or i don't have the cave, slid down, 10 feet, minus minus eight to that. Uh, uh, i do not make it up. I in fact, i'm still east.

01:44:00

Charcoal. Just looks down at the ground, black face, and turns away and crosses his arms. You find this hidden in a cave. You have some planks of coins there, stop falling down the thing and then just suddenly a mound of stuff drops out is no kicks it out. So her just okay.

01:44:28

Look out below.

01:44:35

It'll keep and then masterwork items and gems. Oh silver dragon hide, huh? That's um, pretty rad. Might explain why the silver dragon is hunting the white dragon in this area. I was gonna say we might not want to take that with us, we might want to destroy it.

01:45:10

Please enlighten me on why we would destroy that because it's made from the height of a good dragon. It's like, and now it's life is entirely invaded. You destroy its remains because no way she slides down the mountain, she's snowboarding. Yeah. Disney original disney channel, original movie. I'm just saying, oh she how would you feel if this was the blade hide of a tango.

01:45:40

I've watched you guys kill literally, dozens of birds. Right of a tango thinks about the things that no, i did to the tango, but yeah, i see what you're saying. Um, you think the silver dragon would be offended when it shows up? If we are carrying this item or wearing this item of that and it's just oh no kind of doesn't feel right to me too.

01:46:14

Well, the height of an intelligence, google research. When we come across the solar dragon. What we just asked is over there.

01:46:28

True. But more important player, why does the good part master to you? What's wrong with the head of an evil dragon? I think he makes some very equally sentenced.

01:46:46

It would be much, like, gathering up the stuff, like, it would be, it would be much like, wearing a cloak made of my feathers is here point. Magnus shall go. But, um, i'm clearly outvoted here so. Well, perhaps we could carry it until we run into the dragon again and see if maybe the dragon wants to take uh ownership of it.

01:47:10

Be somewhat like returning a cousin's remains.

01:47:19

Yeah, maybe no one should wear it. Maybe that's the line that we will draw.

01:47:29

Finders keepers. Yeah, speaking of which grace is going to look to try to see if there's any crafting materials or anything valuable to salvage from the corpse. Uh, in general. There's you can use the chimera hide for crafting and stuff.

01:47:50

None of the parts are actually dragging because it doesn't have the dragon subtype. Uh, but plenty of people will will buy a camera hide just for magical, cloak making things.

01:48:05

So you, i will do some more research to see, what chimera's can be used for in magical items and then give you a monetary value. Do you want to survive and check to see how well i go at it or not, please. It's always the chance you could butcher the poor corpse.

01:48:25

Can i aid? Grayson certain, you definitely do not butcher the corpse. Uh, you're welcome to eight grace interviews. I mean you're a rolling privately. Dang. It triggers just interested in how those things going to taste. I like that. So i hated him. Silver. Dragon hide mature, totally high in was consuming the flash, so they clearly vaguely intelligent thing that was capable of using.

01:48:59

What i would argue are advanced hunting tactics and have the head. The send the sentience part isn't really, what fucks me. It's the part about it. I'll be there. You guys know that chimera's are smart for animals, but the only barely they have an intelligent support. Yeah. It's just like a dog.

01:49:29

It's not a big deal health. The thing i was going to also say about the armor is, you know, the long, it takes to make armor like that.

01:49:40

I mean you've got to kill a silver dragon to do it. Yeah, i've been able to pick a long time.

01:49:48

I mean at least i don't think any of us would actually use it. So, but the silver dragon is not going to show up at cs where and one of it or see one of us wearing it? Yeah. Again, i would say, perhaps not go over well offer to return it to them as like a, hey, we found this and we thought you might want it.

01:50:06

Perhaps, you knew them, if that may come off a little racist, but we'd like your opinion on what to do with this thing. Yeah, that's yeah, it would be respectful to do. So given, you know, your earlier aid or some shit like that says, no. Yeah. Exactly. Oh, fucking no.

01:50:27

We should bring it offers. It's, it would be a shame to leave it out here in a cave. Where no one will ever pay any respects or danny use from it? Yeah, i agree.

01:50:46

Well on to be next to me, if there's like an aside in the the wings of hope event. That's like, if one of the players is wearing the silver dragon male discovered and area x. The dragon is hostile, and they all die and they all die on to the next terrifying.

01:51:05

And confusing encounter you know you might all die. He is a CR 14. Silver dragon, i was about to say you said like ancient. It was it was huge. Yeah, i know i'm gonna be blunt. That's a dick dam. Move look that's not a book problem. At that point.

01:51:21

That's just a collective dick. Move, you know, no one should do that, no one should read that. And be like that's fine. That's fine. This is cool. Silver dragons. They're not super understanding at all willing, to talk things through, sort of dealio, really, what exactly no one should read that.

01:51:40

And be like yeah, sure. An OT trudges through the 10 feet of snow, making a little pathway in the way that we were making progress. Oh, there's also this other thing about dragons of that age category, particularly silver, they have the sink called reflective scales. Any spell that targets in ancient or older silver dragon but fails to penetrate the silver dragon spell resistance might be reflected if the castle will check.

01:52:08

It's failed by five or more. The spell is reflected but i'm gonna check bill by four or less. The spell is merely wasted. Wow. This otherwise functions the spell turning capital whale snail,

01:52:27

It has an SRO 27. Wow, again, things that i don't want to do with this level bracket that fighting an ancient silver dragon. Generally no, i mean, ask me again. And 10 bubbles. So we stuff all of our stuff in our one, giant communal bag of holding and we continue traging through 10 feet of snow.

01:52:55

You no, you get out of the 10 feet of snow, it wasn't a very big avalanche. We'll get the troubles a little avalanche. If i was gonna say like the fact that it was just a full round action to dig yourself out instead of like a whole deal like

01:53:16

Just show, go standing over where he thinks zio is and being like, all right. Zeo, you're gonna have to pee yourself to stay warm down there. If you were like an arctic fox subtype, kitsune, you could get like a burrow speed and snow and do like as arctic fox deal.

01:53:37

Just be burrowing around. Oh i will. I will. I will take this for a record recent. You always have major. Yep, that's why i got the buff on you. You said this last week, okay. I just make sure you remember. Can we put me on this area?

01:53:57

And, of course, i'm always cast a girl almost on myself as well. Oh okay. So, what is this d100 for? For fun things or the next day encounter.

01:54:16

48 is a blizzard fun times elizabeth

01:54:33

And moves and have to speed.

01:54:42

And gives a ruck training counter for one deep four days.

01:54:54

Two days of brook to rain, which i believe is the half speed movement.

01:55:04

Oh, by the way, i am really putting the one color tray back on allergy out of last Mickey, transitioned our map to just a picture of blizzard HQ in california. No, barbie Kodak. Boss encounter 55 you find another wrecked. Caravan. This keeps happening. How many times did it happen?

01:55:42

Last session.

01:55:46

I'd like to say i didn't but i can't verify that so you. Oh hold on. There's also 25% chance that i erect care bank contains a frozen dead encounter. We don't, we don't need to roll that. That's such a low chance. You see perfect. You didn't know the frozen dead but you do get some cargo and repair materials.

01:56:11

Oh yeah.

01:56:17

Zero. I think i heard you say you were turning to a wand to the loop list. If you knew that, make sure you mark down with like how many charges and such just so i can never use. It was a full time of color spray. Okay. One extra encounter.

01:56:34

91. I don't think i know what that one is. Let's go and check this person dead encounter. No. Are you serious?

01:56:51

Every time we see, we see the bed coming on. I, i swear to god. Now, he's just gonna make like another part of a holy bomb stuff. So, did everybody in the party? Aim at distance. So to be clear though, we had um, the blizzard encounter first so we would have had a rest between whatever it would have, okay?

01:57:15

So your frozen dead encounter is actually just dead animal runs. It looks like an entire herd of caribou was viciously slaughtered likely by a dragon. She keeps hopping up, guys. We're like following its trail. I wish we were funny. How that works is working, isn't it? I don't like this.

01:57:40

I'm gonna go here. You have some really decent stories to protagonist to doesn't come across the remains of several things and then have to find the big bad thing. Not a one. That's how a hero's story is told.

01:57:56

If our adventure is anything like the stories, we'll be fighting that dragon before we leave the crown of the world, i know.

01:58:07

If anyone i mean we thought scarier things than a dragon like that jelly under the bridge. You know you thought the jelly under the bridge by walking it oh geez. Oh geez. Just uh brushing down his horse, sitting there thinking i had to go try and be a samurai.

01:58:30

I could have just been a groom. Like my dad. Nice stable job temperate. Climate no dying from a dragon. This is going to be a samurai and then i picked up ninja techniques because that's what i fucking do now. Goddamn goddamn kangaroos and they're copy of just talking to his horse.

01:58:48

Why didn't you talk me out of this? You could have talked me out of this.

01:58:55

Does anyone know what dragon anatomy actually looks like asking for a friend? Which by the way i haven't got to, uh, bring this up yet, but i do have my horse with me the entire time. I actually picked him up in the inner city region. Not before coming over because i didn't want to bring a horse the entire way.

01:59:14

But his name is Kentaro, which means big boy because i did some research on. What? Like during medieval japan like horses look like and they were very much like the Mongolian pony phenotype. They're very short, legged stout. Little pony looking horses. So when he got to the intercity and saw like chargers, and dusters, they all would have been like giant greyhounds of horses to him looked like, draft horses.

01:59:45

So, the first horse that he bought. He was like, you're a very big boy and so that became his name. It's just big boy because you're not, it's great, right? I love it. Just haven't talking to his to him. Giant horse. That's a good big boy. Very good. Big boy.

02:00:09

Enjoy how much i don't have bets on his sanity. Going first, i mean he's 90 pounds of bird just shivering and everything he's fought so far can like fly or is gigantic or just generally terrifying. He was like, super down to fight ninjas. Who are like, clearly evil. But now we're fighting like, intelligent living non-eval creatures sometimes and he's like, this is, yeah, i'm very confused.

02:00:39

Oh, clearly evil circle would respond to nobody saying that. With um you say that like we didn't all give up any pretense insanity. The moment we decided to march across half the earth and go against one of the most terrifying men on the planet.

02:01:00

No, i think resistance in the face of adversity is actually quite sane. That's, that's a very different thing. I just mentioned in general, given the general disposition of your group, even before my adding to it. And it's quite frankly, i don't think i helped

02:01:20

Now, if you ask me, we we all lost at the moment. We decided to get on this caravan. Oh, geez! Confused on the power scaling. He's like, how did we fight a bunch of people in pajamas? And one giant, i'm gonna hurt you. Red person with a stick and go straight from that to fighting, like, nothing but flying skilled creatures.

02:01:42

All the time. Then mammoths, you're not like while you're all mentioning about, you know, moving the same moment you turn up the cash back. I lost my sunny down a long time ago. You're a caster, of course you did. Oh no, now it's time. You finally recaptured some of those memories of years, then

02:02:11

I mean, when we found you on that boat, you said that you didn't know who you were. I didn't say anything about it, but who it was. I was i just at the time didn't want to share it but i have lost my assembly of a long time ago effort, you know winner doing what i do.

02:02:34

You know, zero, we actually don't know, really anything about you here entirely on a miko's word? This junction. I can stop him though. If you prefer, i'd say no on that. He's been more than helpful. All this time. All right, i'm not going to protect a weekly. I am a very good friend for this.

02:03:06

Well, we're happy to have you but would still like to know a bit more about who traveling with here. I don't think i actually even know your full names, you know. Damn. No, i actually no idea what my last name gets, don't know my actual family itself. I'm north.

02:03:44

I just know. I can cast spells that make a while back became a good friends with her took a little burn. I realized i could do magic and went that way.

02:04:02

Above board. I haven't really thought much of. It was backspray at the moment, i'm kind of making. Oh okay. You kind of making up. As i go here, i will actually have a more fleshout backstory that he will share with the party. Hopefully, with the next week or two.

02:04:18

Depending compilation don't feel rushed. Don't worry. I like to think that maybe Shoko was like we don't even know your last name and he's just like, i'm an orphan and then dimensional slides. Like a way just dimensional shot. He's like, no. Thank you. And just leaves that's it. There that show.

02:04:41

Go. I was part of my clan that is still supposed to be shanking all of your asses and you work creature that isn't even human. So trucks, was that supposed to be smiles? A little bit? I think it means. Maybe we shouldn't be judging each other. Sure, let's go with that.

02:05:08

Oh, yeah. But why is not being human a bad thing? Oh, she just gets really close on fire and shivers but i've known Theo almost as long as i've known you.

02:05:26

Princess doesn't want him style but you won't get stopped. So, it's not like a bow and just of course,

02:05:43

I guess it's not fair, considering i have initially asked for any of you were from uh, looking to both grace and and don't she

02:05:58

Sorry. What was that episode? Where i'm from and so is ok. I've never actually asked for youtube or from and really matters me at the time but like, oh, i'm sorry. How rude is me? I'm from a village called tieda. It's uh in the heel side province of minkai the far shore from where we well now we're kind of in a northern direction but generally the farthest side of Minkai from the inner sea region, depending on which route you take, uh, i would almost certainly know it.

02:06:36

Let me pull up the map of the entire real quick. You would um if you're looking at a generic gent, a general map of the entire of glarion if they intercedes on your left or western side, the eastern side of minkai and it's a i don't know, i found a province map and it's just a it's just a small fishing village ruled by a local lord.

02:07:04

If you know generally minkai, you would know at least obviously where the heel side province is and i could give you like more details on where the village is at.

02:07:18

I'm technically an orphan twosio.

02:07:24

Dad found me up in this up in the north in the, on his way through the border on his way, through the forest of spirits, which we'll have to cross. If we want to get into the main guy, i'm not looking forward to that. Based on telling me that's literal, it's literal.

02:07:50

Oh no, i just flattened against the top of the wagon and just go. What? I know that, what i remember of it off the time. My head is that some scattered communities of my kind tend to live in there uh but other than that it's mostly home to the kami.

02:08:14

Do i have that, right? I had heard that there were kitsune the force of spirits.

02:08:32

It'll be somewhat of a homecoming for you. Then shoko, i mean, i didn't actually really spend any time there, right? Grew up in the capital. There's something to be said for that. I visited, uh, quan lie for the first time on my journey here though. I've never been it was something to see.

02:08:57

Show go smiles. Oh shit, you have no idea.

02:09:07

I don't think there's a nicer city in the world. Then quan lie. Uh well wait no that's not the capital sorry. No. Yeah i forget what the capital of minkai is quant. Lie is the tengo nation.

02:09:25

Uh the capital minka is a cos i. That's right. Yes. Which i've also seen.

02:09:33

I found it very enamoring.

02:09:42

I'll show you all around when we get there. If it's still well i'm sure it will still be fine. It'll take more than a few decades of ruled by a decimal to bring that place down.

02:10:10

Koya, can you make some more of that curry tonight? Of course, i really enjoy yours. Don't tell my mother. Take credit, don't tell my mother but i think it's better than hers.

02:10:31

Well, i would love to swap them with her. She would love that.

02:10:44

Honestly, i think coins covering might even be better than her mothers at this point. I can't stress how high i praise. That is if the grand lady mubosti worth the year. You say that i would hope she would be proud. She would be your ass. That might be a reaction instead that's talking about Mars.

02:11:13

If you do it too, loudly, mine's gonna show up and frankly, i'd take another avalanche.

02:11:22

See, the ninja with 20 more years of experience worse. She's not just a fucking ninja. She's a goddamn cookie. Oh god. Damn. What a car key? Yeah. Also the clan, okay? Okay. Yeah. The another not a corgi. That would be much funnier, though. She would be very ineffectual in the northern polar region.

02:11:51

If she was a corgi. Unfortunately, she's very effectual in the northern regions Corgi with ninja level. This would explain much to joinery. It's okay. No, it's under the shooney. I mean, yeah, i've always like for the record. I've always imagined that her mother. Specifically is a turfer brawler ninja.

02:12:24

Um, she will be the shit out of you with her fists. Probably did a lot tonight, especially please stop. Story. She did not sound like be nicest person. No. But if i don't know if you're if you talk too loudly, she'll probably just show up out of a fucking shadow.

02:12:44

She's very good at doing this. Um noble actually some point i i'm sorry. I forget this part of your backstory and do you know where she is right now? No, i just like notice the laps and doesn't answer that question.

02:13:10

Sounds like we should go uh, find her and visitor. She looks like Grayson slowly and then goes, no, please don't. It's all right. We can visit my mom and she'll cook for all of you. My mom's a nice lady and we can compare her curry. Yes. What it's worth.

02:13:38

And she kind of look looks left and right before saying this, and then takes up a glasses and squints and says, my mother was a terrible cock. Absolutely dreadful attracts sochi tucks in for tonight. It's not pleasure. Okay, it looks on the wind. You just hear that on the win?

02:14:06

Oh, that's for sustenance. Not pleasure.

02:14:18

But i if it's going around, you can consider me down for what anything with spices. Um, looks cautiously. Um, last year, actually going to attempt to cook that chimera

02:14:43

Does anyone object to us using the chimera uh sugar was incredibly interested in what kind of tastes like now that you will guys? Have spent some more time with them. Um, he, he tried to hide it kind of as a human. But uh, so goes, uh, like foxes are carnivores shoko loves me.

02:15:06

He defucking. He's just like constantly like he just goes to town on anything meek base that. You put down in front of him. Shoko has a bottomless bag of beef jerky. Perfect dangerously. But that tracks, you may have caught him eyeing. The monkey, a little weirdly at times, you know?

02:15:37

No, no. Which one you look out in a very quick tap from now. I just going, please stop eyeing. My stash. That's my stash. Yes. Flick you off multiple times then.

02:15:54

He didn't mean, it went on, just the wander and i bit of a lazy eye. Always had it button to pay me. No mind what he said.

02:16:12

I'm also looking over my page right now. Uh, we rolled that if a class gives you weapon finesse you get deaf maneuvers in its place, right? That's where this is from.

02:16:29

It's kind of a mire.

02:16:35

Okay, okay.

02:16:47

Okay, we're gonna go ahead and take our break. Here, i'm gonna potty and get a new drink kk.

02:17:14

Yeah, i recently learned that we scraps the three three drawbacks for a feet thing. Some making sure that my feets line up and i think they do subscraps, i think i got scrapped for the other games. I don't think retroactively. You have the scrap yards, you may want to ask Samantha.

02:17:46

I mean, a lot of people take free robots and then don't roll play them. Yeah. I've been uh i think the only one i've been successfully. Well, i think i've been playing show goes drawbacks, fairly well. I had taken um betrayed empty mask and doubts and i think i've been getting those across pretty well.

02:18:13

Hey fellow. Empty master, purchase. That makes up.

02:19:04

So, do you think it's too late to all of our characters builds to find a way to synergize with mortal terror to do that thing? You were talking about earlier, Abby. Because like i kind of built, it's kind of come to be like shugos signature at this point is so that spell because it's both an enchantment spell to benefit from being a kitsune, and a fierce spell toon benefit from being a dirge board.

02:19:34

So, not necessarily um,

02:19:46

So,

02:19:51

I'm gonna i'm just doing some mental like arithmetic for a second.

02:20:04

Oh actually depending on how you want to plant, i could actually take some stuff and and take advantage of a bunch of fear of facts. So, um, i might need to reach around one thing, but i could, i can make it work because the only thing that because the traditional way of doing it, is that you generate all of the fear effects yours, which in this case, i wouldn't have to do because you've got them, Which in a way is actually really funny because you just make people incredibly scared, if something.

02:20:44

And then there's something appears and to the grassland.

02:20:55

Yeah, it's it's basically the only kind of saver stuck spelled i can really make work on, uh, shall go because, you know, barred partial caster don't quite get these things that are forecaster does no. But you eventually get like automatic. Um, what's the weather looking for like automatic fear effects from the boom?

02:21:23

I don't know if you have, don't do nothing about it but you are doge bar right? So you should yeah yeah. I don't think i give up there to do though. Um, yeah, i tell you well actually let me because i have i have a document for what i had planned for now.

02:21:41

I went funny enough. I'm going to be honest, not much is on this list. Um,

02:21:52

So let me see here. Yeah, i can dirge of doom at eight level, but like, but the thing about that is that i, you know, i i can't be inspiring competences. Inspire encourage at the same time, shadow Bob.

02:22:11

Shadowbird is how you doing them.

02:22:18

You shut about one performance and then you do not performance. To have to things running, concurrently

02:22:32

Alternatively, you can also use a company and performance, i think it's called, which is another spell, but it causes you to, basically burn through tons of rounds in order to do it. Um, so i don't recommend that one, but the fourth level spell. I think see the fourth or fifth chat about is the easiest, quote way to get to performance is running.

02:22:53

Well, it was also because the thing is dirch of doom isn't. It's kind of redundant with a spell. I've already taken in a feature of dirgebard feature of dirch bar is that in place of an intimidate check, i can make a performance check and use that as my intimidate, but it's not on one target.

02:23:13

It takes a standard action. Whereas judge of doom is every target within your rent, unless you get unless you cast. Um, the smell, i have my asmol dread, which attempt a single intimidate, check to demoralize as part of casting, spell preparing that result to each foe within the area.

02:23:30

You demoralize all those whose dc you meet. Fair enough fun, fair enough fun. Um, that's i mean that's just the spell version of

02:23:44

So what i'm trying to remember is, which treats do i need to take because there's quite a few. Um, like trigger a bunch of stuff for me, just having things on shape. Um, and then the higher level feed saw is a thing, frightened or cowering. And then it gets more.

02:24:11

At that point. Well, i'm probably going to be picking up the stock stop interface to seats one again. And then ask spelled on mexons, because spell time is the anime. Yeah, granto. I might have to uh, retrainarchy that took a seventh level.

02:24:33

I decided not to take have a familiar yet, private mention that i thought i still have a bunny rabbit even though i i take an improved familiar. Yeah, i have. I have a lot fewer feets as a as a result of being partially monk.

02:25:37

Basically, he's my best friend. It's a good question. Uh, creating realism in the metal worms that i make. Actually, he's in a band but you probably already know this because you spanned just hits. Oh, finger down. If you think jeff gold bloom is sexual agree with that. This is one of the reasons why i like using skyrim as an example to teach about this because

02:26:17

Are some up.

02:26:28

Don't speak on me. Keep my name out your mouth because i don't beat for free and the final questions.

02:26:50

On your charisma school and pat with your calendar for them. No, not half your character level and half your skillerex in the second show. Scale in this case. Um, that's how you do it, because the worst way that i've seen at the table in the most annoying one, frankly.

02:27:11

You know, there's probably one. I'd be like, actually that's cool. I'm not gonna do it every round. That's all right. Is where they take corner gone. Snatch and as a dm, you need to make a will save every single time they roll on it. I hate that somebody ridiculous.

02:27:28

So i live a quick match.

02:27:34

As an arcadeus, even though i hairstyles, you know, for my for, you know, my number of public per day and i can't be cast out, like i prepared in any in any amount crushed myself per day it happening. I can cast a yeah. You, you get, basically, you get social or casting, but you get to choose the spells that you have every day.

02:28:05

That's why the archivists have overall fewer spells but i've got known because you prepare them each day. I am returned.

02:28:20

Give me something. Oh, you go, you can go ahead and i understand i was just curious. Uh, so sans. I was looking through my feet and i will i recall what you said about how we weren't doing the three traits to take a feet. Thing is that retroactive like should i take two traits and a feet off of shoko?

02:28:47

But no, it's like i said, it's fine in the games that are already running. It's just been removed, the ones that are already running. Our grandfather did that actually means i get an extra fee because i forgot to put in the feet for that. It should be drawbacks, not traits.

02:29:04

Yeah, three drawbacks for it. Yeah, i was like if you're just taking bonus, feeds and bonus traits, that's totally different.

02:29:21

Growls and mongrel build.

02:29:30

Is everybody here? I think so.

02:29:39

They're way to do that thing other than signature skill intimidate. Because i don't actually have more than one ranking intimidate because i was going to build around being able to do it with just performance. Unless you've got a fit a spell that can drop someone pretty much immediately carrying.

02:29:58

I mean do you technically have the the second home ability from birth? A lot of you choose a performance as and you can third part doesn't have breast tile, i believe. Now they don't they give it up, okay? Well, they do give it up or don't give up. Okay, i was just curious.

02:30:39

No way. Do you have any cool poisons that are contact or inhaled? Then you can make radius. Yes. And yes. What do you want them to do? So now every wiggling her eyebrows, i have a cool stick where i can blow it out and make like a smoke bomb effect and the point.

02:30:58

Now the poison sand tube. Okay. Well, i don't know about poisoning people for damage but you can always try this and she tosses you a small black vial. Um this is a vial of right shade, which already hasn't happened. Fortune has an interesting property because it's in haled and no matter if they make the save they're shaken.

02:31:32

So it's always gonna work. Yeah, just for like emergencies i can do ninja smoke bomb stuff, but this is always fun to have in your back pocket. It takes three doses though. Oh, it doesn't 15 foot cone one does each creature is affected with one dose when loaded with un poisoned sand?

02:31:56

It has a terrible DC. Lame effect.

02:32:04

But yeah, if you have like a cool or fun or useful contact or inhaled poison, um, Oh, she can blows hand. He can do pocket sand on people. See i don't particularly use contact poisons myself because frankly, there are always a little bit neither here nor there. But yeah, getting into the crafting of poisons was like a little bit beyond me.

02:32:29

I realized when i made this character, that was like his three. Original weapons was going to be his specific, double walking stick. Katana, the poison sand tube and the two barrel shooter. I had him like a sneakier character in the beginning, but now, you know, he likes to, he's trying to be an honorable little birdman but he's kind of falling out of that and leaning more on his ninja stuff.

02:32:51

Since all of this hardship and moral quandary has fallen upon him. Oh, no, it says, no way pulling out her alchemy kit. What a terrible turn of events. I'm so sorry to hear that.

02:33:10

What can mama had to make for you? What you're looking for a farm pulls out? That is the thing. We just heard with our ears guides. Yeah, i was just thinking. Yeah, if you had any contact her inhaled on you, so the fright, one, sounded really rad, if you'd be willing to give some up of those, i would totally pay you for them.

02:33:31

Oh, she just wants to be able to contribute with this stick. He's been carrying around the entire game so far.

02:33:40

You can certainly take out those at least now we're i'm looking for anything.

02:33:47

Um and i will do some some thinking so specifically specifically inhaled or contact the way you're looking. Yeah, it's it calls it out in the weapon. Type filled with fine sand that is soaked or coated with inhaled or contact poison. Wow, not injury. That's that's that's interesting but we can we connect to with us i can think of a few.

02:34:16

Yeah, it's just a fun little vehicle to 15 foot comb that on some enemies and i tough situation. Okay, okay, so this is happy. Yeah, excuse three, bottle vials right there. Does i just hit everything? Does it? Yeah, three doses is what it gets loaded with dispersing it into the faces of enemies.

02:34:41

In a 15 foot cone, each creature is affected as of afflicted with one dose, jeez. All right. Okay, nice. Yeah, if you don't have, i mean poisons are expensive in hard to do is what i learned really about it, but if you make a meconomically, it's fine. Yeah. If you um, don't put any poison in it it's like a DC 12 Fort save for dazzled for one round so without poisonous a pretty useless, pretty useless weapon coming.

02:35:19

Okay, so we want something fast back.

02:35:26

Okay okay well leave that one with me and i'll i'll put note a couple because the ones that i particularly know of anything overall like injury. Yeah, so it's like a whole different space to be messing around with them. I just thought i'd bring it up in character because it's fun.

02:35:44

Oh no. No is like rubbing her hands. Just going like, we're going to find out if i can even make them in suboctic temperatures. That's true. That's true. I knew i forgot to put something in. I said, if anything else, sorry, go ahead. I didn't realize that something. I forget to high for my character if anything else OG can just pack snow into it and try and dazzle people with a DC-12 snow guns.

02:36:24

I get i get partial concealment or whatever, the lower level of concealment is from for 15 foot cone for one route,

02:36:39

The one thing i forgot to buy for the character as a journal, a waterproof journal. And rights notes.

02:37:01

Which is a scary program. I need to be taking.

02:37:16

All right. Are we ready to resume? Ready to rumble. Yep. Hell yeah. Siblings.

02:37:29

You are the weirdest brother i've ever had. Those are the Hulk Hogan thing.

02:37:40

What the fuck is, Hulk Hogan? Hell. Yeah. Brother, probably have brother that that's who it is. But i i know i was being called

02:37:57

But just finished loading. Thank you.

02:38:09

That's about to do the whole network. He goes up to each each corner of the campus is erotic to see anything pokemon.

02:38:23

See now. Look what you've done. I've i've gone down the poison pit hole again and i'm like i was going to make no way all about poisons initially. Yeah, it's like that full moment like that tick tock sound where i first looked at poisons when i was coming up with this character concept and i was like, no i sense.

02:38:44

I've made some kind of mistake. The only reason i didn't is because i know in character, no, it would be using grace. And as a testing ground.

02:38:55

Um, which you grew up for me? There. Is it nice and spicy? How is it gonna take me to retrain one feet? I kind of want to do the same with this at this point of uh retraining feet. Yeah, it will take at least a week. Oh, she can teach you psychic sensitivity and we can like touch people's heads and know what class and race and level they are.

02:39:26

Or, uh, we can douse. We can find water and treasure with two sticks. What the fuck? Are you talking about? What? She's psychically sensitive.

02:39:47

You get all the occult skill unlocks of which one is pretty decent for not specifically like weird occult stuff and you have to sink hella ranks into a praise to. I think, what essentially detect magic for like a minute casting time?

02:40:10

Uh, so retraining feats cost gold equal to 10 extra level x. The number of days required to retrain.

02:40:23

You can also do faith healing.

02:40:33

Oh gee, i was well and we're training of feet takes five days with a character who has the feet. You want that part is going to be problematic.

02:40:47

Because most of the people who would arguably have the feet you want? We just murdered maybe. Oh, i'd be very surprised to be that another video. I need the an indigo's, the

02:41:06

Alteration.

02:41:11

It's on, it's on a, it's on a list of things potentially to do. And uh, yeah like in characterize i, i totally be done for no, i just being like, hey guys and can you just chug this? For me and tell me how you feel.

02:41:27

Any numbing sensation loss of cognitive function. You start seeing colors? Nope. Definitely, i would, i would totally arpe it, like, he's like a wine connoisseur, giving it on his entire palette.

02:41:50

All right, so this has been fun. That is resume.

02:42:06

After another day of travel, you don't really have any more strange encounters aside from the slow going, but is the setting sun comes down. You see what looks like a camp up in the distance with roaring comfortable fires and what sounds like people having a good time.

02:42:31

As you get closer, you see claim, markings of aritake, no way you would recognizes the silver Martin clan.

02:42:48

Oh, i can't say i know too much about them but i this can identify them.

02:43:06

Uh they are known. The hunters made up of mostly a combination of every talking and orphan.

02:43:21

But last you heard they were fairly friendly.

02:43:27

That tracks.

02:43:32

This show called a fox are a person right now person. He's only sorry, human and fox. He he takes his human form everywhere other than like the privacy of the camp. And even then he's not going to b of fox form in camp when we're anywhere near like civilization.

02:44:00

Oh, gee. Are you a bird or a person right now? I'm a bird person. No, no. We've just established. The choco. Can't be both a person and a fox. So, you ergo cannot be both a bird and a person we've switched this, right? You lost me because zio just fired.

02:44:20

A magic missile at these strangers. At the darkest, is that i always been fun. Okay. I'm picking a joke by the way. Please, do not fire magic missile. Dark is this like a cool hinge? What are these stones? Oh, wait, actually until you describe. I'm sorry. They're tense actually, man.

02:44:42

This is going to be some cool solstice stuff. Nope, just looks like an air sucky and cabinet playing people around the fires.

02:44:55

So here's some cheers. From some of them as they see you guys approaching from the dark. She'll go, you're good at talking. You say is you have no way in a language. You don't understand. Shout out. Hey guys. What's up one? Who speaks the language of our people come in.

02:45:16

Come share in our food. They're cool. God damn it. I don't have any of those languages. What a shame? Get the uh, can we get her portrait blown up for us?

02:45:41

I'm scared.

02:45:48

And she picks up a betray of cooked meat, one of her tribesmen, picks up a tray as well. Come enjoy our fire. We have had good hunting, are they speaking common or scald or something? Uh eritage. But if it looks like no one really understands the bill switch the scald.

02:46:08

Yeah. Can we get a roll call? I don't understand airtaki i speak scald or common or the probable ones. No, just kind of laughs. So just like there, you might want to go with something a bit more well-known.

02:46:30

Common time. I mean they don't have done a lot of languages about that. Greetings. No. I kind of looks at the elephants and just and switches the scalding goes, do you speak the language of their people? Then we do. Yes. We trade with them often so they don't speak common.

02:46:52

They speak scald gotcha. They do speak common. They do actually speak common. No. They also think giants. Yeah, i speak giant. Hello, we're all just arrowitake put itself in there, four times. So it speaks aritake erotake, erotake erotaki, hell, yeah, they speak. A lot of arisaki, we're all just shouting at each other in different dialects.

02:47:23

They're all just shouting at each other and random languages. Your journeying far in the off season.

02:47:35

Yes. Unfortunately, our business doesn't allow us. Go ahead. Sorry, and we would be most grateful for your hospitality. It's been a long cold road with many dangers. All that's um enjoy the fire. Thank you for sharing your fire and oh she will try some of these sick meets. Yep.

02:48:00

They just go around and they pass out a handful of food for everyone and then she waves you over to their fire. Oh, she gives like a little bow to like these three when he passes by.

02:48:16

No, it's just gonna go just gonna ask one of the well, the guys just what's uh

02:48:25

Yes. Is this a celebration? You guys are having.

02:48:33

Uh, white rye, he says he's going to the restroom bio.

02:48:47

Normally be all the amount of information i needed about that.

02:48:54

So these three are performing some sort of dance and singing. We have had good hunting this season so it is always good to share on the road. You never know when you might go without and OT will agree and pull out some sake that he's probably had since calls guard, and offer some to her, and to the dancers.

02:49:22

They very much appreciate you sharing your your food with them as well.

02:49:31

The fire is warm. They all seem welcoming. Uh, it looks like they have a merchant in their little village where you may sell things. And in our help, certainly.

02:50:01

Uh, what's there? So limit thousand gold. Yeah, but we just saw them, the bullet armor plates, then that's like a thousand cold. Exactly. Oh, they're very happy to take those off your hands.

02:50:23

Boom. And after everyone has eaten and joined by the fire. I see a couple of stragglers back there.

02:50:35

Assume happy hung back to make sure we didn't immediately drop dead. A poison in the meat. I i was about to say no is like she, she's talking open with it. You've never long enough. Now, to be like you should still being hyper standoffish and double checking because like they are talking are from my understanding, a rather hearty and wilson people, but also they crafted my mother so i have second thoughts about that.

02:51:06

One. That is fair but they are very normal and eat and make Mary for several hours with you next to the open fire. I would ask pretty early on also. So what uh, your successful hunt. What have you brought down? What are these seasoned spoils? I she smiles at you.

02:51:40

Well, you see, there's a white dragon on the loose that has been making our hunting quite easy, very sloppy eater. I can say easily that we've collected, several dozen humans that were well were establishing a couple of snowcaster elves, a dwarf or two. There it is. I must have heard you wrong.

02:52:12

He says as he gets stabbed to the throat. Yeah, there's no in the back, just snaps her fingers just like ah,

02:52:24

Welcome to the cannibals cam.

02:52:30

So i so they they bought stuff from us back. I guess we i guess we get those bullet page back in a second. Let's see. They think they're getting the money back.

02:52:48

Initiative of their so many. I was gonna i was gonna ask if, you know, before all that happened because at a scroll of passion path, possible. Oh, it was gonna be a second rolling into it now. Yep. Where's my? I knew it initiative. There it is.

02:53:25

I guess i should be a little bit closer to a group.

02:53:31

Yeah. Wouldn't have been all that way out.

02:53:39

To be fair. Now, i probably would mic away from like makeup at the very least. So i'm going to take a guess and say that should have been like either here or like maybe here but i don't carry the what

02:54:22

My game just super freeze.

02:54:28

Oh gee, i don't think a 13 hits your flat footed. It does not.

02:54:37

And then, the combat begins. No way. Oh no. I know what she says. Five foot stepping. Yeah. Charcoal doesn't have a great sense of neither do i, but here we are.

02:55:05

Still open fighting full attack. Plus this guy have any way of not being flat-loaded. Um, i don't think so. So let me uh he does have uncanny dodge so is he seventh level? He is second level, that is not gonna do it champ. Rip. That's, that's not going to do it.

02:55:37

Um, and this would be no, i'm sorry. He's, he's third level but still still not going to do it. They're not gonna do it. So, So that was that was the first swing.

02:56:00

Supplies around. By the way. Boom. No, the surprise around already happened. This is the first round.

02:56:17

Yeah. Wash mg says that she comes up behind this guy and you see to walk us just appear through his trust.

02:56:29

Sorry, i thought we were trading blues.

02:56:38

And then as a swift action because i remember i did remember,

02:56:58

Worked in.

02:57:02

Uh, well okay. Then he was gonna attack you. But then you vanish. So instead he charges on me.

02:57:22

Oh, and he reached.

02:57:27

Oh, they have range. Of course they have range like an overvariance. Oh geo. I don't know why i assumed rogue. When you said they had uncanny dodge just yeah. I know most people kind of thing like. Oh, right and temperature. What i want to do.

02:57:59

I'm going to do it.

02:58:07

Well, i look at the

02:58:17

An intent to blow them up.

02:58:29

They all take full damage and are barely standing.

02:58:45

Yeah, pretty good.

02:58:54

Oh, move action. Pulls on a one.

02:59:01

Ready. Oh,

02:59:44

Locoya loves her star knife center.

02:59:57

Urge.

03:00:05

Um, super charging.

03:00:11

And misses.

03:00:19

Almost dead cannibal.

03:00:34

Church. Fucking rage double moves.

03:00:52

Five, footstep.

03:00:57

All right back, let's do. We're thinking misses. By non-primary, mrs. Etchy, they can animal tries to take a bite out of you.

03:01:19

You could get salmonella and good poultry.

03:01:29

Miko. Has enacted. So, she doesn't get an attack of opportunity.

03:01:43

Yeah, there's so many

03:02:04

You're gonna go here.

03:02:16

Okay, that's cool. Whatever. Amigo gets nailed really hard with a throwing ax. Directly confirmed it does because her flat but it is 13, i hope.

03:02:49

No one. No one can see, no way.

03:03:19

18 inches live. Voted ochie. Yes, you take up their own ax. Increase in.

03:03:33

Uh, guess it's gonna do a to pull tech against starting with the guy who's right next to Coya to get him off her.

03:03:55

First arrow. Second arrow. Drop some, where do you want your third and quiero to go look at down here to help makeup. The boom. Both third arrow. Kills him. Where do you want to quiero to go? Those are the ones that only have two hp left. The boom. That one is, unfortunately, it will help.

03:04:24

But now he's a 180. Okay. And who, uh, he's gonna take a five foot step, uh, up to help. I kind of tank against their hips.

03:04:43

Very good. Oh, gee. Okay. Uh this is really fun. Oh, she's gonna just start. Swinging on this lady who made him. Eat some people uh, and see how that goes for him. I am gonna spend a key point to add a attack to my full attack.

03:05:10

So, so

03:05:26

That connects that misses.

03:05:35

Edit.

03:05:39

I think that's about it, all right, you cut barely deeply into her and she appears quite wounded.

03:05:54

I really didn't do all that much damage.

03:06:00

It's true. You did not the human sin.

03:06:10

That works better people in that works.

03:06:26

I'm sorry, i think there should be one more attack in my full attack at this level because that was actually cooking full attack or are you still eating single day? I did him single. Unfortunately, i was confused on what level we are, but i'm pretty sure my BAB is high enough to have an iterative now.

03:06:44

So is it all right? If i roll that one as well and i'll just put the minus 5 in

03:06:52

There should be no modifiers, it affect it being first or last or anything like that. No there should be actually so your first step should be plus 13 and then your iterative attack should be plus eight.

03:07:12

So you are main handing the defending walkies? Yes, so one was for my regular attack. One is for spending a key point and there should be one more for the iterative for the main have a main hand. I don't have improved two weapon fighting to get the iterative from the offhand yet, but there should be a total of four attacks.

03:07:33

I didn't hit full attacks so that's my bad. I just want to be able to take that other attack.

03:07:41

Pull attack. All right, main hand. Iterative is a 20 which is a hit for another nine damage.

03:07:56

I have just wasted an enemy's crit on your attack roll. So everyone be happy. No, no. You haven't tried to hit me yet. You do everything you can to avoid being seen in this game. It's hard for me to hit you up. Yeah, i wonder. Why considering? I don't wear armor and i'm not bracing.

03:08:19

All right, i may go.

03:08:24

It's had better work.

03:08:31

A fun hands.

03:08:42

Over attack. My fuck amigo.

03:08:54

I so she does. This really elegant? Swing at about shoulder height and just decapitates those two over there you don't see it but you're fairly certain that there's a sound on the wind that sounds like okay, that's hot.

03:09:13

Okay, finally, inspire courage.

03:09:22

Some of you man. It looks like most of us already had it on. Yeah, yeah. Oh i just put it on. So,

03:09:37

Uh, yeah. And spider courage. And then, um,

03:09:44

Five foot step over here.

03:09:50

And,

03:09:57

On. No, it's a move. Actually, it takes something out of your pack, isn't it? So i guess i will. Well i can find much stuff and do a move action, right? As long as it's not moving. Okay, so yeah. So i put stuff and take my walk without and they'll be in my turn.

03:10:22

So the lady i've been stabbing needs like six health back because i'm terrible and add inspired courage on. But i think most of the hits would have still hit. Uh i do believe all of them would still hit. Yeah, i'm sorry i'm really bad at the buffs. I will try and do better and remember next time.

03:10:46

Down here and we're gonna go here.

03:10:55

Oh, and she loses the spell.

03:11:03

Oh, he was currently curious. What about you're trying to cancel? You may roll spellcraft. I don't know how to fail.

03:11:18

Yeah. Beast of ashes. Yeah. Accordingly. I don't think i could spell that even on one. That is her turn. That's a dead cannibal living cannibal.

03:11:41

Excellent.

03:11:47

Uh, single attack.

03:11:53

That's going to be a hit is the gentle boop.

03:12:05

Boom. Boom.

03:12:10

Little while up.

03:12:17

No way. Excuse me.

03:12:25

Well, i have it wonder what i'm going to do.

03:12:40

It did this. Dude is super undeath store right now by the way. Yeah. Well, you know, we need to, they need to be absolutely certain. We need to be absolutely certain.

03:12:58

A man exploded today, several men have exploded here today. This this cannibal village was not prepared was was not prepared and you know i got this far in the crown of the world on in the dead of winter. Like who did it? Did they think that we were just like a bunch of merchants?

03:13:25

It is not how they think. We survived all the dragons and the undead and the and everything to be fair. It says no way coming out of stealth with this guy just like skew words on a walkers actually. Most people look, i'm through here. Probably are just merchant, kicks him off and then disappears again.

03:13:50

It's for true. Well yeah that's why i specified. We're in the dead of winter. When people aren't usually coming through here?

03:14:03

Oh, i have, i am very i am very almost have to do this but i don't want to yellow key, kill ochi.

03:14:15

Okay. Nice group of people and i screw where i can hit them with fireball do it. Rain fire.

03:14:37

I think we need to be on the lookout for a ring of fire resistance.

03:14:55

There we go.

03:15:00

Oh yeah. All right too late. I can't never mind. I guess i can't get that.

03:15:09

Does that hit me or no? No, it doesn't hit you at all. It's not.

03:15:34

Anything else on your turn blur? I will spend. I will spend an arcane point.

03:15:53

LA GTO. The other side here. And that that will be antimicrophone.

03:16:05

By the way, i was tea. Looking looks pretty fucked up. That is the end of my turn.

03:16:23

Anyhow, deadly, aim. We're done. Queer this time. Jesus christ, the land do deadly, same things.

03:16:35

A bum unfortunately. That's not a critical you missed by three.

03:16:45

Forget to star knives, create on the time three. They they do be popping. Oh, genitals that cannibal live. Cannibal.

03:17:03

A club or ochi, there's an 18 hit.

03:17:11

That by definitely misses.

03:17:18

At cannibal dead cannibal live cannibal.

03:17:29

Charges.

03:17:42

And apparently yes. Michael, boom. I cannibal charges.

03:18:03

I don't think of 23 hits you with major armor going. Uh, correct does not have boom and now it's your turn.

03:18:18

I'll attack. Yeah.

03:18:30

Grayson's essentially playing a tower defense game while the rest of us are playing Pathfinder uh third arrow. Misses key arrow though. That is what they're not just do. Yes.

03:18:48

And you guys hear your thinning in the crowd. All righty ochi's going to do a mostly repeat of what he did last turn. He's gonna five foot step this way, so she can't five foot step away from him on her turn. If she's still alive and then he will spend a key point and do some stabs.

03:19:21

We will use full attack this time.

03:19:31

The first one hits and there should be an extra one. So, i have more attacks if we can turn them around on the guy below me.

03:19:44

I think nope. The 14 actually hits on him.

03:19:51

I have another one from. Okay, so i don't need it, that's fine.

03:20:08

So that will be the only interning.

03:20:16

Is that important sir? Yes. I'll make, oh,

03:20:52

Um, that cannibal shoko.

03:20:59

Uh,

03:21:04

And tell me look like he about to run.

03:21:09

Yeah, no.

03:21:18

Not on her on the other homie in front of me.

03:21:32

You stab him in the guts? You almost like have his life out with that.

03:21:43

Appointments up here and turn.

03:21:53

The she has a constitution of 16.

03:22:00

All right, so she's only a negative 10.

03:22:07

He's stabilizers. Animal. Cannibal. Cannibal.

03:22:22

All right, well, you and Claire are both getting exactly opportunity. He is just trying to book it out of here. Yeah. What you telling me? He wouldn't withdraw.

03:22:38

No withdrawal.

03:22:44

I mean he can't from where he is oh no he can't, right? He can go straight up. Well, you would also five foot step out of corners range, and then just book it and take an attack from choco.

03:23:06

That is also fair. She'll go you take your back not that i like giving the enemies advice this one because he did not. In fact, get away at all. So he tries to run and show go takes the dagger, that's already in his stomach and just disembles it.

03:23:31

See. That was the homecoming. I was expecting.

03:23:43

There are lot of those up here. And what about this? One under greyson? Is he still alive? Okay.

03:23:55

The lady was still alive. No, he is still breathing. Yes, you got one round to tell? Nobody not to stab her. Oh, gee steps over here and begins. Vomiting uncontrollably on the ground.

03:24:11

No. No. That's the correct answer. Yeah, by my turn to you know rip open a rift and then come back over.

03:24:28

Or he no 10s 12, not 14. So after wiping his beak with his sleeve, he steps back over here and is looking at this lady on the ground and says Hatsuyuki. I think i'll leave this one to you.

03:24:56

Uh, at which point, you see a wakazashi's edge come out of invisibility and just completely a lot of this woman's throat.

03:25:11

Anuchi is going to wipe his to short straight blades, off in the snow. And take a few steps out here and just sit down and like a meditation cross-legged stance and just like try and center himself after realizing that he just ate some people.

03:25:44

I feel like this somehow roundabout comes back to that conversation. We were having about sentient creatures and using them in various ways, but i don't think that's the time right now. And this.

03:26:03

Coco size and says, well, it's regrettable. But what's done is done, you should dispose of their ingredients and gather what we can from these people, we should burn the bodies or what's left of the bodies that we can find. Agreed says no air tossing. The i'm the conveniently placed bonfire.

03:26:33

Yeah, just just you see here like pick up this woman's like yeah. So he's going to go around and take through their stuff and pull out. Every people looking bit and pilot on the bonfire, keeping it alive by, not putting too much people on it at one time.

03:26:57

Oh, that is our balance and bonfire so offer for lucky, maybe the spirits of those that have been desecrated here, will find some comfort in knowing that there are perpetrators had been brought to some level of justice.

03:27:21

I certainly would be.

03:27:38

So, when we switch the camp, what else do we find? It's all posted in discord.

03:27:49

If you find a lot,

03:27:55

Yeah, gonna be real. No is gonna at least check that ale and be like. All right. Please open ale. It is just open ale just oat nail made with real orphans. Real. And that's that was the part that i was scared about. Huh, gonna reach in there and find some?

03:28:18

I don't know. Fermented toe or something like a bad tequila. Yeah. Oh she's gonna say one of his oh g prayers tm over all these burning body chunks.

03:28:36

Well.

03:28:45

Excuse me, real quick. I have to make another bathroom.

03:28:51

So, i have decided i'm too memorized. Commitment, two. Men metric people. I'm picking up. Yep. I'm picking up selected. Minor magic or select a spell and intensified spoil. Okay, that's fine. I'm selective is the reason why for selected. It's because if you're in the middle of my 80 spouse, i can choose you.

03:29:24

Swear you and you don't, you don't get hit by it. Oh, i know how it works. I'm just disappointed in you for not committing to the bit and just blowing up the party on marriage occasions.

03:29:38

Wanted to that way, i could hit a lot of people that are like, what do you turn on and looking like, did you really have to hit me a fire? Um, keep the news your garden.

03:29:56

Production, topically, reasonable.

03:30:02

So, i have a question, informal surrounded, and you will have me in a nice little main group of the United scale in the last area and you haven't read in it. Are you okay with being hit by the smell? If you're stood in a space, when i swing my sword, am i responsible for you being scared?

03:30:24

On the end of it.

03:30:30

Okay, i'm back. So that's a good way of phrasing that

03:30:38

For what it's worth. I wouldn't blame any one of you for wanting to kill me but i think what you're getting at is probably that you don't want to feel held responsible for the fact. You might literally set one of us on fire. So yeah, depends on how your conscience feels, i guess.

03:31:02

So i i don't really understand how she makes like movements wiggly movements with our fingers. How a that works.

03:31:19

I don't know. It's happened. Whoa, baby in dark completely unrelated. Good news though, i double checked my feet. It turns out that i don't even qualify for the fee that i wanted to take. Anyway, so no, retraining requirement. At least, not yet.

03:31:38

It's okay. We have time, folks. But in character though, we can feel free to imagine that this this uh Grayson becoming a connoisseur poison to the thing.

03:32:02

You know, it's daytime when you get there.

03:32:16

Everyone may hit their roast button because you have one more day of travel before you arrive at the kalyan.

03:32:29

The only felt i get back to my third double foes and one arcing point, but two arcade ones?

03:32:47

Are you sonubut? There you are, there's nerves the geckos as you guys get closer. You see that the small town of ikalio is kind of in a bit of an uproar, uh, part of it is built into the clip side and it seems like everyone is moving quickly.

03:33:29

And not long after you guys start approaching a middle-aged erotaki woman walks towards you with purpose, not with her weapons drawn. I mean, she's using her spirit to help her walk but she's not coming. To fight with you. No hostile of 10. Yeah. And as you get closer, old gormander holds up a talisman.

03:34:05

And she nods when she sees it. Ends of the callet. You're welcome here. Come with me to my home. I will offer you some warm goat silk. It's from a go away. Fermented.

03:34:25

From a real goat. Of course, i wasn't gonna stop me a chicken. Not nowhere else. You would get goat milk from you, just say we had an interesting encounter on the road. We have to cite our sources out here on food stuff. So apparently, let's see. I mean, no is just going to say bluntly and our attacker just like, we have some kinsmen with an orthodox.

03:34:52

Taste be nods understanding, and lead you to her. House is actually a built stone structure.

03:35:09

Right up against the clip side.

03:35:14

What is going on? Lightning, global illumination enable.

03:35:30

And upward in the fucking movie.

03:35:38

Thank you for welcoming us into your home.

03:35:46

It is our way though. Some of our people are known to abuse that reputation.

03:35:56

Yeah, to the chair.

03:36:02

I suppose things are rather chaotic for your people right now, though. Yes, there seem to be a bustle going on when we arrived. What, what's the occasion? We are being plagued by a white dragon and more so called moroseco's have swept down from the high. Ice blocking all trouble, along the path.

03:36:28

Wagon high moroscows. They are called the hungry storms. And they have never traveled this far. South are the hungry storms dragons. No.

03:36:52

What are they? Did it cause them?

03:36:59

Of the five storms. Sorry. Could you, repeat i asked, are they related to the only of the five storms? I meant sans.

03:37:17

We believe that they are driven by malevolent intelligence. I do not know much and much of anything of these owning you speak. They but they are in. Tiandria on the other side of the world just pass the ice but it's only been in the last century that they've been appearing further and further south Is almost like the storm type of mind of their own around the same time, these great black monoliths begin to appear.

03:37:56

Gone. The highest and the boreal expands are more dangerous now than ever and so you're plagued by the storms and the dragons we are.

03:38:12

No one wishes to make the check to iMo anymore, hearing the city soon to be swallowed by the hungry storms. So these are literal storms like actual storms. Just moving. Oddly. And you think they might be being controlled by someone or something?

03:38:38

It was a well-known druid who spoke of the malevolent intelligence behind the storms, but they are not just ice and wind within them. The sounds of streets and cries unnatural cold.

03:39:06

Would i recognize this phenomenon at all? I you might recognize them for what? She's describing. No one knows what they are. Currently. Yeah, i'm trying to get as best as a description as i can from her to. That is all literally, all of the information from the wiki about them.

03:39:29

Oh so it's not like okay thought might be like a creature that they didn't have a name for like that.

03:39:45

You know, the artwork leader by the way, which i did really quickly this morning. So it's kind of janky we encountered on the road, several things linked to what you're speaking of, we found one of those obelisks planted in the grounds guarded by a snow whip a snowman.

03:40:09

We noticed that the inscriptions on its more of an old language but the obelisk itself was of new stone. Can you tell us anything more about these things? No, we only know that the black pillars have been appearing and each is guarded by the, the walking dead and that they have appeared all across the crown of the world.

03:40:39

We also saw the white dragon, several places and learned its name. What was the name again?

03:40:51

Something. Veg food. That's an excellent dog. It's back vectors and bargain and found another. He's currently being hunted by a silver dragon. In fact, we told us something of them, the white dragons, apparently gone mad.

03:41:22

He has been rampaging now for several years. He does not eat what he kills. He simply destroys and moves on.

03:41:48

We do not know what started her rampage.

03:41:56

You are. Welcome to stay here. But i have the dragon guards have passed north from here to allow you onto the experience. And the storms block, the eastern approach. I do not know how you intend to go to the boreal expanse. Yes, we had planned to continue across but the way seems like it will be difficult.

03:42:29

If you insist on going, you will be passing through the dragon's territory.

03:42:35

I mean, i don't know if it's possible to slay a storm, but uh, maybe we need to go dragon hunting.

03:42:48

So, hell of a thing to say so casually, grayson

03:42:56

Oh please, you people managed to murder most of my kinsmen and my known family. I think you'll handle a dragon just fine.

03:43:08

We do have. Some more of a chance doing right? Have otherwise that's quite a thing to say in front of our new host here.

03:43:23

It's not as bad as it sounds. We've had an interesting history together, they see.

03:43:33

I mean no i would just kind of look up etc for a bit kind of realize what you guys are getting at. And then turn to um, the woman. And yeah, her best are attacking it. Just said you can have it on my life that these individuals are plenty capable of defending themselves.

03:43:53

And their goal is far and above where the the challenge of trying to fight a dragon. So, the details of my backstory are probably not relevant here and not related to. Well, any of you do you have enough to eat, or possibly trade? We wanted to resupply here before continuing on across the expanse.

03:44:24

You are more than welcome to. We may be light somewhat on such things. Well i meant all your people. All right. Do you have enough provisions? One thing has been good this year. Okay, well, yes, we would like to trade. We have found quite a bit on our travels here in all the carnage from the dragon.

03:44:59

Sorry, did you say that? You had someone tell you about this, i forgive me. What did you call them? Uh, hungry storms. Yes. This. Druid are they still around? I'm afraid not, they were killed near a century ago. After the storms appeared, the storms have existed were almost a century.

03:45:33

What else happened to century ago? Stuff sword. I'm a tattoo things. Yeah. That's that's kind of century ago. Yeah, grandpa. That was back with amico's grandfather.

03:45:52

I i need a timeline again because i might need to revise show goes entire age at backstory because i thought i thought the empire emperor died only like 30 years ago. Shell goes just really old with jade regions.

03:46:12

Okay, so there's a lot of stuff there. Like shoko has the skylight idea. Yeah. Yeah, there was a puppet emperor for a while. The other royal families were hunted down and killed. Like there's there's a lot of mystery and back stuff that you would have no idea that happened.

03:46:33

I overall public knowledge, your story is fine, the imperial shenanigans as a whole started about a century ago, i think is what the general census is. So if you were around during the shenanigans when people started getting kicked out of the palace. Yes. You would be about a century old.

03:46:54

Okay, will need to talk about that later.

03:47:06

Yeah.

03:47:12

Connected.

03:47:27

Women.

03:47:40

Got it.

03:47:44

Uh sorry where were we in the conversation? He just told you that storm started about a century ago. The storms lined up with the amitatsu's fleeing in the overthrow of the, the family, the last of the royal families, literally, like they almost followed them. Hmm says no. This is definitely the work of the only, would you say that they were very cold and they shouted them Pringles eyebrows.

03:48:20

He's never gonna get boring by the it seems confused about what you're talking about. Yeah, don't don't worry about it. This happens a lot. But forgive me, you said that it was about a century ago and there was a uh, what is it a druid or something that told you about them?

03:48:43

Sorry, for asking for details. But if it's going to borrow our path, i'm curious to know exactly what that person found out.

03:48:55

Or if you have any records on whatever they are, no only that. He believed them intelligent.

03:49:04

But compo.

03:49:10

And then you hear the sound of a bunch of people clamoring and approaching

03:49:21

Not another party.

03:49:26

Oh, she's gonna go to the window we'll step outside to. Oh, there's a lot of people outside. We have company, this man surrounded by swirling. Vortex of wind.

03:49:44

Oh no, wind tears. An agemen though? Still hearty. He leaves upon a twisted staff wrapped in a heavy gray. Cloak decorated with air attacking tribal designs. It's brown, eyes are yellowed with age as are his few remaining teeth. And his balding head is a patchwork of short, wiry white hairs around his temples.

03:50:05

And at the back of his head tribal tattoos decorate, his liver spotted fate pate and face wrinkled and worn by wind and sun. He carries himself with an air of importance expecting to be heard these outsiders intrusions will only further inflame the dragon's anger. Our sacrifices will no longer propitiate.

03:50:31

The wind spirits. It will not suffice the outsiders. Think can be removed, only by sacrificing, one of them and the rest must leave at once. Hey hey you and and her sister attacking. Could you fuck off? All right. Well since someone is playing an error talking, you get a plus two, circumstance bonus on this.

03:50:58

You may use bluff diplomacy or intimidate against him. Oh, i mean, the one that the no is probably going to go with is just going to be like, blow up to be like, this is nothing to do with us. She says no point now knowing full. Well, it is actually to do with this but you're also going to get a plus two because head mistress.

03:51:22

So now boot comes to your assistance, to defend you. Yeah, so you see nowhere at the dog? Just kind of like a round. Choco just just going Chris. Well actually none of you speaker. It's hockey too. So, as far as you know, she just babbles a lot. This this declaration in eritachi, aren't talking.

03:51:48

Nope. In eritucky, but i have no idea. What's what he's saying? Uh, yeah. You see? No, i get like matte. Um, no not quite starving mat but quite fiercely, mad and tries to, to total back quite a bit that is without the the plus four. So 30. And uh, all right, so here's the fun thing.

03:52:19

You're going up against him and he gets a plus five to this roll. Boo. Boo, i see.

03:52:37

So you got a 30. This is really not fair.

03:52:48

Except you noted. So remember that you keep quitting me thing. What the hell? You can't even manage to do it in, skill tracks. You still have to correct me.

03:53:06

So that is that's so rough. And now since that didn't work, the only time you're ever going to see. No, i do anything diplomatically. He's now she's probably looking like stabby mode is about to happen. No. There's actually three realms to this uh where you can either immediately engage in combat and lose the crowd or you can keep trying to argue your points that you guys are not.

03:53:37

Uh, awful things. I and will be different here so i can happen depending on if he wins all three of post checks. Uh if you only wins two jacks or if you win all three checks i mean but after this first round you all get to make a sense motor.

03:54:07

Check. No stabs. Hot soyuki. We are going to use our words. I'm sorry. What? Jack? We all get to make a sense motive, i can i can. Fail, you a sense motive? Um yep too. That's, that's a.

03:54:28

That's a director of sugar. Yeah, if you, if you call know, i had to you, she turns to you. And in like quite a feverish pitch continues talking in our attacking and then kind of catches or something goes. Sorry, sorry. Sorry, i'm fuckwd over there thinks. It's a good idea that, uh, you know, maybe they should put one of us on the pyre because we're clearly to blame for all of the shit that's been happening to them.

03:54:56

Oh yes. Xenophobia, my favorite about meeting new people, right?

03:55:09

It's still really wanted to believe. I'll make up with my hands on your shoulder. We can still talk this out. Just let's all keep our heads. So that nobody gets baked. No, no we can't go out. She'll go still standing in the doorway. I'll make it was trying to push her away through so go, let's go go through absolutely.

03:55:40

Bobo. And she is going to take over.

03:55:47

Hell yeah, he rolled up four roll. The horn can any of us roll? I was assuming that we couldn't because no airtaki only only one person can roll. And you guys go take number three. He speaks heritage i mean i could take it if you want. I have plus 10 bluff, i have plus 21 block.

03:56:15

Boom, i've got minus 2 below. I don't think it matters anymore. Drink this. Grayson, i actually is anyone trying to assist on me? I mean, yeah. Yeah, she's doing diplomacy. So yeah, that's the me going for diplomacy. Uh, i can auto aid diplomacy. Yeah.

03:56:46

Oh we can aid in the post, check you can. And with that, plus the plus two from the head mistress and plus two from the aritake the crowd suddenly doesn't look quite. So sure that he's right. Yeah, it's not the it's not that no, i doesn't want to help you help your thing.

03:57:07

It's that she's not feeling diplomatic enough to not just disappear and shank this guy, which you might do anyone

03:57:19

O g. Pulls out some manicles and collaps one on nois arm and collaps the other one to his arm. No. Stabby, just kidding. I'm not gonna be weirdest manage proposal i've ever had, but i'm not interested.

03:57:34

No murder. There's round. Oh kanaya, can i take number three or does? Can it only be someone who speaks heritage? It can only be one person around. I know someone can translate for you, if you'd like roll that shoko.

03:58:01

You just have to beat a 32. I mean pretty solid lazy. Yeah, it is. Yeah.

03:58:17

You are definitely assisted. Yeah, i think that's a solid wooden right there. That is a very solid win and if the new arc only wins one of the rolls, the villagers wave him off and permit you to stay the night, but they ask that you leave the following morning.

03:58:54

Can we still trade? They will not trade with you. Now. Hell, yeah. Dude, who the fuck is that guy? And can i kill him? Still no asks not asking any shoes that's gonna forgivement. Was the head messages managing offer? No, i would ask him. They were talking about here is here.

03:59:25

Do you need my life? E is actually a strange one. Great one.

03:59:48

I can't be right and we'll look at that later. He is time to work is aren't shaman.

04:00:16

I have other people in person.

04:00:22

There's a pretty good point, i have other people for sense of

04:00:34

Anyone else motive? Oh grayson. You got it. I the new lock had ulterior motives were trying to get you guys killed. It was not because he thought you were going to bring the dragon here.

04:00:52

You say is your summon. Um, how long has he been that?

04:01:03

Three decades now. He was training has replacement. I will be happy when he is no longer in charge of our spiritual matters. Hello opens. Replacements all trained up then. No way gets her way it is strange for him to do this. I would like to speak with them without a crowd in place.

04:01:39

Would you be willing to accompany me to his tent?

04:01:46

Or his shrine. Excuse me. He also has a stone building.

04:01:53

Yeah, of course, of course. We'll come with. There's a question. How long would it take us to get there?

04:02:03

Five minutes than the other side of town. All right. I am very kept following this weekend. Let's go, south.

04:02:21

Do what you want and go wild. I am pretty much preparing heighten awareness. Are you preparing it or casting it? I am casting pregnant, awareness.

04:02:56

You know, i was i was really hoping that at least one half of my heritage wasn't full of psychopaths and people that are well prepared to murder one another for these slightest inclination, but it's good to know that. It's pretty constant. People are people wherever you go. And i hate all of

04:03:28

I for one think these were pretty reasonable folks considering

04:03:34

You think it's reasonable for you to accuse people? You don't know and immediately put them on a pyre, a classically and human history. Yes, but notice how these people did not do that. It's just the one guy. Yeah, his story really doesn't hold up.

04:03:58

Like,

04:04:04

If you lived in the north, as long as these people have, then they have to know. That's you. Don't you don't appease a white dragon. If a white dragon wants to eat you, it's going to do it. You don't bargain with the things very comfort, which makes it all the stranger that they find a bunch of people who are well-armed, and well, capable of potentially dealing with the problem.

04:04:29

And their first instinct is tough. Fucking kill them. Well, let's go talk to this zealot and see what he has as far as answers. Hey, what would you be a full help of this point? Yeah, it has been a day. I really happy with the situation and of all people, know they're being angry at someone, trying to kill her for no good reason.

04:04:51

Like, yes, well, nothing will distract us from. Oh, look a shark. Nice. I'm gonna put something worse on your tea. So where are we going? Where is this guy's thing? This person's i think she walks you up a few would look like a little wind shrine. Good. Tuck, where is lunaric?

04:05:21

She is not here administress. He has been spending much time up at the wind alters late.

04:05:30

That's that's up top here, it is up. The tunnel to the cliffs. I also don't know.

04:05:44
