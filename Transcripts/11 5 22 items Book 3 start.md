Both suspends the rhyme Runners guilds, operations, and seizes all of its assets are conducted and the Norm King immediately in publicly distanced itself from his formerly cordial relations with orbitals were for your part, in avenging, his blood feud upon asbic long to use and forward. Silver sport fin, sniveled up officially relinquishes.

00:24

The ownership of solution. Do you agree? As promised, In addition, he offers to invest a 2,000 gold in Sanders Caravan in exchange for a cut of any profits.

00:42

You can choose to spend this wealth on any improvements for the caravan, including new wagons caravan equipments or caravan hire lanes, but you cannot use it to purchase personal equipment for yourselves.

00:58

Also, with Enosity. Now in your possession you have access to a wealth of history on the Amitatsu family and the only of the five storms that is rad.

01:14

And with Oak, Gourmander as your guide, you can begin planning for the journey over the path of Aginhai and through the deadly or Zokos storms as they cross the crown of the world.

01:30

And telling you get in the other books. So, excuse me, my switch.

01:55

Did everyone get a chance to look at some of the cold weather here? I we have purchased we've purchased it. Previously, I've had cold weather gear on my sheet. I think we did it. When we started to get into cow's guard and I looked, I couldn't find anything more than like, a cold weather outfit.

02:13

And So, I mean, I found other stuff that I know that I'm gonna want for going north but I mean, unless there's something I'm like super missing the cold weather outfit gives you like big, a big bonus on fortitude saves versus like freezing temperatures. Yeah I've also been some rock and uncle with their outfit sometime now so that's just me asking like is there something else that we're supposed to have or that will help against what we're looking for?

02:46

Is there anyone who doesn't have cold weather outfit? Because Grayson doesn't need his anywhere Grayson's too. Tough. That's goods of the winter on the skin. Not these two tough. He's near to poison oak because he's tough. I have fun girl up, but I might prepare to start preparing with any extremely cold.

03:09

It's like a new problem.

03:19

Okay.

03:44

Where did you pull these paragraphs from? Is there like a section that I wasn't able to find on like conglomerated cold weather traveling stuff? So this is the specific list from the book that I'm pulling out for you of everything that is available for purchase in Khalsguard. Okay, cool.

04:05

And if they didn't make an appearance in other eight, any other AP. They may not actually be up on the website. Yeah. Because I like went through like the equipment and services and kits, and like, all that stuff and trying to find anything that I thought might help. And Some of this isn't in here.

04:23

Like the ax I'm like, yeah, that makes sense. Of course, is probably have a real hard time.

04:31

I've been working with one fewer spell comments posted, didn't have this entire time because oh, fucking boundary told me I had all the spells I had. Even though I didn't.

04:54

The other one? Yes, I do. Okay, I'll take that. I have and I haven't in my phonebook, but I don't, I don't program but I can and a neck had a dime when I need to.

05:27

Will considering that we have many plans after us. It might be useful from now on that.

05:37

Yeah, I got a start preparing it.

06:12

I'll take saving for that. That's,

07:00

So, I guess here's a question. Then when we're talking about, because we've kind of, we're doing the caravan rules differently or not at all, we're sort of our peeing. Those is what I believe we've landed on. So what could we use the 2000 gold on? I love to see pack animals that will survive in the weather.

07:24

So like obviously the ax and maybe sledify the caravan a little bit because I can't imagine if we get into like deep snow, like the caravan wheels are gonna do like any good. In fact, the opposite of that spend that money to just kind of outfit. The caravan to be able to move through the super terrible conditions.

07:46

Yeah, I like this because all and you Shaka have suggestions and like it is technically sand. Drew's caravan. So does he have things suggestions or or input on it? I wasn't the one tracking the little bit that you guys were doing for your caravans recall, someone spending money on the caravan.

08:16

That must have been a very away before my time. Yeah, Yeah. I don't remember us doing anything with the Caravan before. I don't even remember. That's almost mechanical wise that Then we can keep just running into the side thing. You care about improved by another 2000. Gold hell. Yeah.

08:38

I mean I would you guys rock here before I joined so I don't know anything about the care of that. It has been a hot minute since we did thing with the caravan. Yeah. I mean, Grayson and I are probably the only one that like when it originated and I neither one of us is tracking it obviously.

08:59

Okay, but I mean that's what I would like to see. I know there's actual rules for it to beef it up, if you're gonna play the Caravan rules but I think that's like winterize the caravan so that it can travel easily and safely through these. What's going to be some pretty deep snow and ice all that fun stuff, and Sandra was kind of already doing that way.

09:25

You guys were in town anyways rap and yeah. All of them are getting outfitted with the winter kits, all that within the layers guide. So we'll just hand wave play care event. So I might pick up some either cleats or snow shoes.

09:51

So let's if we're doing shopping for the caravan. Anyways, can be, let's talk about the lead sheet and did everybody get what they wanted? So that we can get this cell total going, it kind of gear up because it may I have a strong feeling this is gonna be the last time we can buy stuff for a while.

10:16

Let me just take one more. Look at building sheet, just a big triple. Double sure. I'm pretty certain that. I don't want anything off that, but let me make triple double share there. Is we have quite a few ambulance in that little armor. So, if you don't have one, just grab one.

10:33

Yeah, and I mean, that was more of a question for Sam than anything. It's like can we do some shopping before we go because otherwise, we're gonna just carry 40,000 gold pieces worth of stuff. Oh, no, this, this is being giving you a chance to do all of your logistics purchasing before you leave because yes, you will not see a city again, this book for sure.

10:51

Cool, cool. Okay, that a good thing. I know at the end of last session I took the Racers of archery lesser. But then after looking at the more, I realized the bonus that they give the plus and competence to attack role actually doesn't stack with shoko's product performance. So I've actually attended to put them back on the loop list to sell or if someone else wants nice.

11:22

Catch, and maybe the Tinder twigs. We want to hang on to maybe move them up with the potions. I'm gonna bring other stuff. I'm everybody should try. And like, keep in mind like, heat the ability to create heat, it's probably gonna be pretty important, but those are going to go hey art.

11:44

Okay, I can with anything on part so then the no way on the other team is going to come and assassinate you and then wheel all freeze to death.

11:55

I wasn't thought but honestly you're kind of not entirely wrong apparently. It's really easy. Yeah, you just imagine a fascinating a high level adventuring party by just taking out their life. Level one hedge mage and then they all freeze to death. It's a, it's the fantasy equivalent of cutting.

12:14

Somebody's brake lines. You don't have to beat them to death with your hands. You just got to be smart.

12:23

CEO. Do you want that? Partially completed. Scroll of planar binding that we found. Maybe this power city completed. I don't think I'd ever be able to complete it. All right, bigger, you're the only one who would be able to use it or completed. Eventually it I mean it's worth everything and it's current state, I mean, what would it?

12:44

What would take to complete it? I really high school craft check. I guess spread scroll. Yeah, I wish I don't have

13:03

I'll just reloaded. What the hell? Sorry, I'm adjusting a module.

13:11

All right. What's up guys? Take something.

13:18

Any? Yeah, because I didn't want to buy start buying everything on my list until we sold all of our loop because I had some money, but I already spent it on gonna ask Grayson to make me something fancy.

13:35

Yeah, I'm also looking at things. I need to spend my money on.

13:42

I also want to know how long does it take to get the weapon enchanted. Depends on how big the enchantment is. Yeah, but generally a date for a thousand gold.

13:57

Do we know how long it is before Sandra would declare that we're ready to leave updating the wagons fully could take up to a couple of weeks, Okay, Probably actually.

14:19

We've got time, I could get some enchantments and I could hire people to retrain foods. Okay. So, but just to be clear, we're good to go on splitting up. The cell total as is now, right? Everybody's had their look at the, yeah. Believe me. I'm ready. I'm good sound off.

14:37

Abby, you're good. See how you're good. Yeah, I'm pretty good. Okay, I think everybody else is already said. They're good. So What is that split? That's the that partial complete school is worth something. If not then.

15:01

We'll just hang on to it. Maybe OG will take scratch role If it's worth nothing. I mean, eventually it could maybe could Koya finish it. I eventually. Well then, there we go. It's an investment more characters. Be carrying rations right now or is that all to be terrorism than we care about?

15:25

I it's gonna be hand waves in the caravan for both good and ill.

15:33

Oh, you walking around in days in the direction. Yeah, we'll just

16:44

It's gonna be one more reload.

16:56

Might have the roller impending, the inversion back by one point.

17:08

The only drawbacks to using modules, they don't always come out with updates the same time.

17:33

If how are you guys looking on sending money and you need the Kel's Guard sets again. I don't remember if I pin them to the channel and not

17:46

What the money that each of us gets 8,000 items in fifty gold I suppose to the side of Thank you.

19:29

And,

19:37

Possibly 10k to take us through, plus, two of us. Three.

19:50

So I will none of you were really interested in the week they had before. So, I will roll for you again. It's been about a week all minor items remain currently available. Board before, medium items. Now, we're going to try this with the module.

20:29

Magic items, generate medium magical items, or you need for

21:00

Like you only drop one item like to purchase the 25,000 gold cost.

21:12

Two hidden.

21:38

Oh, Larry Principle. I know their way to expensive, actually.

22:40

All right. Nine medium magic items.

23:00

3d4, major items.

23:26

Family food. You guys can get the cool whole years stuff together.

23:41

Made a quick pool all of our money together. We could buy those racers of armor. And Grayson could become a group tank.

23:52

I mean, do you want to just do the AP by yourself? This is how you won. 1988. Oh, that could be interesting but feeling one failed. Save against the charm, spell make APP over. Yeah. But Grace, I don't shoot everybody but when that happens. Yeah. But he percepts them.

24:11

From 10 miles away. Chains everything into wisdom. I know, but you might want.

24:23

Come in. Can I show you something real quick? Yeah. Okay, so these are babies. You are presents. That's a fucking here. The best way. What's? Oh my god. Fine. Twenty thousand gold. What that's so rad, right? And and separator you gonna have so much swag. Oh yeah he's gonna be a cool little boy.

24:50

I want him to wear this pitch one with the Akatsuki one over it. That would be fucking hilarious. Chad milk pain. I thought they were kind of well, you can still purchase All minor magic items are available in Kelskart. It is a very large city and how would we determine if something is minor or not?

25:15

Officially their classified.

25:22

Like, if we go to the the magic item,

25:30

And open up, we'll go with weapons.

25:39

On this page.

25:49

Perfect. I found on the in the ultimate equipment, where the so they because he can't crop them. Grace, metal looked at. Purchased some eyes of the eagle. Oh yeah, those are red lay available guys. The 2,500. And so, what I get that that that that covered a fine.

26:30

You say, you're gonna go and purchase a set of fiberglasses legal and now I just takes off her glasses and it's like you want them.

26:49

It was a genuine question. No, you need them as well. They're cheap enough. Not a problem. I think we're determined that my eyes are about as good as my wits at the moment. They didn't. How do I throw on the ability to use a spell like ability? Again, I go to the Settings, have your sheep very tops that spell books, click the spell like spelling ability when

27:27

Bubble spelling. Okay. And plus two plus three is 10k is not. Yeah it is. Which is why since Agile is the most important enchantment to me, I'm actually thinking you'll just raiding in the was the blade that the that came with my Psionity. Yeah, my Scion naming which it feels disrespectful but It's like I and not gonna comment on that.

28:21

People, I just walked over half of my desk.

28:29

This person, this thing is 8K. Plus the masterwork costs which is 350. I think 300 plus the cost of the one.

28:44

And it's an amazing spell. I'm gonna be taking that later. On little spelling weapon do. It does. Is it worth more if I put the spell in it beforehand? I mean, you could Nicola time down to a single use of the spell if you want to joy. Suppose I won't.

29:03

I will make you.

29:18

What's goes down? It's like cost limits again. I think that That's why I dropped it in the chat. About the line and funded. Yeah, I know what they yeah, it's not there.

29:39

I missed their marketplace section. Here it is. Chosen. Oh yeah. Next, got it. It's quite high.

29:55

A little time.

30:03

I'm a fire. I'm trading and overlay. Sorry, it's got it's going.

30:40

So, pretty much everything sells for half. If I'm trading back and upgrading Right?

30:51

Pictured and gems.

30:58

Oh, they have a a band up intelligence Depends on the type and power of the headband of a television. Hey, just supposed to at the moment. They have all minor items available. All right, and I and would have a big skill.

31:28

What I have to look for one.

31:39

If you want a specific skill, you can have what made for it. Or I can roll a 1D pen and tell you how many skills and knowledge I'm looking for. Flyhold point That one's gonna be a custom crafter. Yeah.

32:03

I mean can I have one crafting here in town? You certainly could would pick four days to get here, coordinate and make. As we are coming out for headband important here, as we were coming back from the Ravens crack and like, starting to get into these preparations and stuff and Omega was like kind of quiet on the walk back and I imagine she's been a little quiet through this whole process OG wants to just like check in with their and Lady Mako.

32:45

I hope that they didn't do anything too horrible to you.

32:53

Are you sure you want to continue with this?

33:00

I am very certain that I want to continue with this now more certain than I have been. Well, anything really. In a long time It's only going to get harder from here. I know you have my sword swords.

33:23

Well, that is good because I'm going to need them from you quite literally while we're traveling.

33:30

But you want to hold them. No, I want you to practice with me. Oh yeah. Yeah, I can certainly I was like what the fuck did I do?

33:49

Like no way like completely almost murders Koya. And we're all like, Well, you better not do that. Again, Ochi cuts the head off of one troll. And it goes, like, give me a fucking swords, you're done.

34:07

That would be really mean not noise. Like genuinely feels pretty bad about the whole thing and tell this by the fact that when he does decide to fuck off and go and deal with their own thing, she leaves both of her walkers off his behind. That's really crazy. I mean Ochi like obviously he's not gonna forget but he's like forgiving it, right, but he's been pretty like quiet through this whole process to like I imagine a Mako and no AR cuz like he's really grappling with the fact that he totally murdered that role.

34:48

Maybe has one or two more drinks than he normally would have. What should I spend $3,400? Gold on whatever you want, okay? But like, if you wanted to be an effective Pathfinder PC, and you were deck space, like me, what would you spend your goal on? Because I don't know.

35:13

I got like all the miners of everything and going to have grace and craft it. Once that conversation happens, where I know that you can craft, if he's open to it, I've already allotted gold for that. So like my headband and a bag to carry all my shit because I can't.

35:32

But other than that, not super, super sure. Now on my weapons, I got all my big five. What do I do? Remember, right? You're you're not wearing armor because of your class stuff. Yeah, I got bracers of armor. That's what I just spent like half of what I had left over on was upgrading those another increment to two.

35:58

I can't afford to go to three because it's way more expensive to go to three live here. So, there's only a 5,000 difference. You've got enough to pay for the crafting. Can you craft braces of armor too? Get to now with tailoring. That's what I'm saying. That's what I was like.

36:20

Pay someone here in the city to do it. That is true. That is true. So Christ. Okay. Yeah, and I do that. And just wait, if we have the time and pay someone to build them, We have a few weeks here. So, I'm pretty sure the two okay, too.

36:49

Yes, I think well, what sounds like a couple, what can we just reverse engineer for the math sake? If I wanted to go for a plus 3 for 9,000 gold pieces of if you bought it value cost or whatever. Does that fit inside the time window? Like I said, I'm not super familiar with the crafting rules and people five days.

37:10

If it's only a $5,000 5,000 gold difference to go up I want to go from one to three. So what I had was one and I sold it and just outright paid the difference to go to two as if I bought it. But if I go to 3, it's 9k.

37:26

Well, if you haven't take the plus one greater is the difference to a plus 3 is 8,000. Yes. A crafter 4000 goal plus, I don't know if they are going to charge a fee or not then that's, that would be it because it's half. Because what about the time frame, though?

37:44

Because I know it's like dependent on the goal pieces, right? It's a thousand gold per day, So still within a week. Could I do that? Even if he wants me to pay more, I'd pay 500 more than I already. Did what's whatever you want. If you go to a crafter specifically to make them for you, instead of a merchants In Cal's card, you're gonna be Yep.

38:10

In a step in the line. So you're gonna want to do it kind of a touch. Sure. We'll charge you a 15% of charge that skip the people that they sell do so 1500, big ones, almost like 13, something. I don't know the map of my head. 15% of the cost of making the brazers, or the market value.

38:36

Maybe okay, of making the braces cool. I'll figure it out a deduct it.

38:53

And then just a group knows, I'm going to be crafting, a bag of holding type 4 for pairing group, loop and effect touch. And then all your goals on that. And that's only 5,000 pins left on that for a type 4 Well 10,000 to buy it. 5,000 a profit.

39:38

Sorry, can you repeat that? Are we, I was already looking at that saw that, you were building that. Did you want us to share in the cost? Because I'm super down to pitch on that you don't have to. I definitely will because I would love to stick a bunch of my stuff in our group bag because I am a failbird.

39:56

I mean, if people want to contribute to the cost of it, they can. But I'm not. What did you pay five? You said, Yeah, but yeah, I'll put a thousand towards it so you can give yourself a thousand back.

40:13

I all right. Now to ask. So billion Considering we're in a capital city, can I just more or less? Like unless it's like a super specific weirdopy tonight more or less assume that I find people to retrain with okay to run each of them are I mean unless it's a yeah out of the box feet.

40:42

That's super weird. No good. All right. Open Love Screaming at people to teach some things. Well.

40:57

All running by you would become is so fairly posted a list of what looked like beats that all of our NPCs had. Or they is that what they have software for training correct?

41:20

Completely like gain feats out of out of the usual. Well, they have gained levels with you.

41:38

Andrew is a fighter hybrid, So he has a lot of beats.

41:45

Toyota questions for everybody, I think that coming of you guys would not like to be in large at all ever. Okay.

41:59

Yeah, no, larger color. Orphan it close. But a no-go Didion. Oh no, you can definitely find that here.

42:20

Shoko disappears. Offered to a strange corner of the J Quarter and comes back every night singing distance.

42:44

And if I have two weeks, what's five days per week? So,

42:53

How does days spent crafting work? If you have multiple things that they have to be consecutive? Or can you work on things all at once at one thing at a time? Yeah. Okay. That's what happens. And it gets even less. When you're adventuring That makes sense, we could stay 15 days, could we?

43:22

Does that be exactly? Two weeks. OG is currently carrying enough items that they together way more than he does. There's nothing in the book. Preventing you from saying for that long just thinking up with the group? All right, Shoku would ask if we could stay one day long, eat stuff, but it will be worth it.

43:55

Oh my, That's right. That's okay for you. I find used ones anywhere, I believe there was that we'll use ones in the loop that I rolled. Oh, I whereas people, they want a person dirts with each charges in a fat and our ring of the ramp

44:27

So what ones are you looking for? Just a one fireball with not, not maximum charges, that's too much.

44:51

A little one full squarely in the medium section. So no. Okay.

45:08

So in our 15 days, there Grayson crafts, the following items. He you upgrades his headband of Inspired, wisdom from a plus two to a plus 4. We crafts. The bag of holding type 4, he crossed a bag of holding type one for OG and OG's, headband of alluring charisma.

45:28

Plus two, Get on, like, you're my hero. I was gonna say her silently and wait for you to craft all your stuff. Thank you yourself was pretty cheap and pretty quick today. Okay, that changes everything. And and then he has the materials to make some deliquescent gloves. You just like I had time to make them yet.

45:54

Or the goal that they get. Oh no. He had the gold for it. He had almost 7,000 gold sitting in his pockets from like the last two or three times, we've sold everything. He just kind of held on to his gold and not bottle with him.

46:17

Kind of, I'm kind of think of someone taken by right now, but I don't know if I if it would be available.

46:39

And they are.

46:49

So, some Either spell that teeth or first per second model,

47:02

A wet. I spelled like this.

47:13

It.

47:21

Sure, the phone is called.

47:29

And I typed out in this work,

47:34

Oh, spell lattice. Yes.

47:52

It, you can find one of burst or second level. Awesome.

48:16

While I'm looking for, I guess they would have to be specific. Oh my gosh. Yeah.

48:39

Moment for either ability mere image. Particular dust. And you pull from the sorcerer with a direct if I do.

49:03

Hey.

49:09

Ones of first level that you find. I'm looking for two second level ones.

49:24

You second level 1G find. Yep.

49:31

I didn't have no ignore that. Excuse me.

49:43

I clicked on one again. Whoops, little pool.

50:00

Those are your second level ones.

50:10

Well, technically true for real actually work.

50:24

That's working, right? I have both friends from hitting disability.

50:31

Depending what needs an extra like 600 gold to push them over the amount to purchase something to something that you can have it.

50:42

So get the one of the twerking ray and invisibility.

51:20

40.

51:26

Quickly.

54:56

I'm assuming we can hit rest as many times as it takes to be full elf. Also Oh, quite yes.

55:10

From picking the DCs of might be vocations about the way.

55:55

Plus two belt is 4K, right?

56:09

Oh, does anybody have an extra 80 gold? What? That with my extra gold, we could buy a campfire. Bead, I'll throw on it. So then we can have Dave Gower per day campfire that I can just create out of nowhere. That's reusable. Yes, I will take that near down very handy.

56:31

Would you say 80? Yeah. Here actually, if you want it you can put it on your inventory sheet. Yeah. Cool. Campfire. Bead. Yeah. We're just outright. Purchasing that that crap? Yeah. Okay.

56:50

Will need it every night while we're up there. But you know what, very important, if someone I don't get wet for or whatever,

57:15

Okay, I added it.

57:21

Some of the other stuff that I grabbed because I did look through the snow applicable stuff that I was looking at heat stones or an alchemical item that will keep you warm even in like below 20, they're like, ten gold apiece or 20, gold, a piece, or something like that.

57:42

And they last for long time, well, not days, but hours, forget what the increment is. Case anybody gets cold?

57:59

And I grabbed one of the climbing kits off of the loot list before it went. I don't know if any of you guys have climbing but I'm anticipating, possibly some, the wall from Game of Thrones scenarios in OG's. Not a good climber. So,

58:40

The the big the polar equipment list is that mostly just stuff suggested like the caravan in general. Or That is what we're individual use for the most part.

58:56

All right, I guess I'll be looking through these a bit more closely, then I misheard.

59:07

Did you guys take any stuff off that list? That's some of the stuff that I found previously, like I, for example, I've got survival, it's not super high. So like I picked up the map makers kit, and I've been just now looking at the Astrolabe. I don't have. Oh, it works for survival, too, because I think we might keep it track of where we are, and like, snow with no, landmarks will be pretty difficult.

59:37

But the skates, skis snow goggles snowshoes, cleats, all that stuff. I think might come up in the players guide for this, they're quite a few things that give you trade bonuses to survival, and like that was kind of integrated into the story and, like, multiple different places and they are really pushing these guides on us, olf and ukshaka.

01:00:01

So, I think I might also buy a set of that stuff, but I have twig arms. So I would like to big Grayson for the use of his sack. Could you please rephrase that?

01:00:19

I would like to request. Grayson to use his bag of holding there. Yeah, it's open for anybody to store whatever they want.

01:00:33

Yeah, I think at a bare minimum everybody should probably look at a cold weather outfit if you don't already have one and probably some snowshoes or you're just I don't know if there's any mechanic for getting tired from stomping through snow. That's like waist deep all day, but I would be exhausted after about three hours of that.

01:00:55

Any questions? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Cold, weather outfit and snow shoes. And I think we've already seen those dropped in loot somewhere. Like, with offs gear, maybe, when we picked up all of a makos, and wolf stuff, and Ravens crack, I'm pretty sure his snowshoes were there. I think these are all.

01:01:13

I have 2K left over So I might just buy like a set of all of these things for like each of us. None of its super expensive. I think all of the stuff that I bought that included like other knots. No related stuff. I think I spent 300 gold.

01:01:37

I picked up, I picked a cold weather outfits and cleats, don't goggles snow shoes.

01:01:47

Abbey Ungood and then just don't got to worry about snow. She is literally a frozen shadow. She gives you like a hand. She's been wearing like a Hawaiian shirt with a tank top under it this whole time, and it's literally snowing outside.

01:02:16

To answer your question about movement, though, as a character. Hmm, this is, this is one of those things where I'm, like, outside of Kombat, I don't think she has a problem at all with slowly. The rain or frankly, anything that constitutes difficult to run in combat, it becomes a small lover.

01:02:42

I thought I saw the price listed for the Astrolabe in here as like a hundred gold, the formatting on Discord, the way that I have it, on my screen right now, is messing with me. It's a thousand gold for this thing. Can I get a one? One question to the GM.

01:03:06

How bad do we need? Astrolabe. Mmm, Let me put it this way. OG has survival. Andy has a compass and he has eyes and he does care about astrology a little bit. So, like, he, you know, he pays attention to those sort of things, but he doesn't have an astral labor, know how to use an asteroid, it can be very, very useful to have one.

01:03:35

Okay, he started. I've got a I'm gonna be right back real quick on here, something out but I did send you like a message. Sounds. Let me know if that's okay or not just because I didn't want to bulk conversation. Actually be right back.

01:04:44

And,

01:05:01

Look very well. I don't think foundries advance enough to make me account for like having to wear my headband for 24 hours before it gives me my bonus but I'm not seeing it go into my charisma total or my AC total.

01:05:22

Good Tori. I had been the greatest man changes. Oh, it just wasn't on there. I didn't even look. It was not, not all of the items have been finished pressure. I've gotten better at these. I just haven't like dug into the item itself yet, I do know how to do that myself.

01:05:46

Now, I've tried really hard to get better at Foundry.

01:05:55

I am taking up. I am thinking of myself. I will pay for the scroll, add it to my bubble. And picking up 12. Knock.

01:06:25

I think it means enough that I'm gonna pick up the asset lab, and take the bracers of armor down to two, instead of, I think the actor, right? I'll take yes, right? Yeah. What do we need? Use yesterday. Ghosting shutdown. To use it. Yeah. You need to be taught how to use it specifically called out.

01:06:48

I don't have time to do shit. I will give you the money for yesterday then, okay. And is that something that like all would be able to show us how to use or do I need to go? Find someone and like learn about it. Hope actually knows it though.

01:07:06

He seems to prefer his sextant event maps. Now, I have to Google what a sextant is. It's like a step down from the Astrolabe.

01:07:26

Okay, here any question. Okay, I've had a really good.

01:07:36

Great open shotgun. What you brought them? Well, yeah, be somewhat besides okay. Yeah. So, this is a lot of question. Each other. Okay, check in all knowledge. More or less. I want to rank in it. I have to put that what the it should be higher. What the hell?

01:08:06

No, never mind. It's fine. It's but inside, we're good, we're good.

01:08:21

And add something additional ranks. You get my ranks weren't right. Oh, she's gonna spend some time meditating, and like mulling over his, his murdering that he did. And it's just going to be with like what I've done by Linkin Park playing in the background, as he wears his little bird robe and like sits under a tree and looks sad.

01:08:50

And then Optimus Prime shows up and says, sometimes good people have to do bad things, It's okay.

01:09:42

Yeah, I guess I'll just run up a quick tally of a bunch of

01:09:52

Well, I mean what have we spent on what you already took into account? All the money we could spend on being specifically for the caravan in here, right? Getting in the dog sled the packed animals. All that, can we look up them? I'm handling. The caravan stuff. Involving hand weight.

01:10:17

Wait, no. I want it to be canon that we buy a dog's lit and hook it up to the winter wolf. He does not. I knew that was coming and if you even so much as mention it to him, you spoon, find out you're not, welcome near him again.

01:10:39

I'm just saying who would stand a chance if we had grace in on a dog sled behind the winter wolf?

01:10:50

In order to certain point, I think your ideas might constiture four crimes. The Geneva Convention doesn't exist in this world.

01:11:03

But that wasn't a negative statement. Hit that was like a OG ants. So proud of you, more of a just and making you aware,

01:11:21

You're out of line. But you're right time, most people's perceptions in it.

01:11:54

Area level one hovers. They're not a good mix.

01:12:30

Was everybody doing?

01:12:42

After Naga was those away for a while comes back. And what looks like another ring of life various trinkets hanging from our neck on the seems to be carrying around what looks almost like. Pulling isn't a good thing in glory. A white ling. I mean, nine pins probably is in like aldor Yeah they seem garden games.

01:13:14

Oh, they definitely do then it won't for the ground. So that's that they definitely do. And I was just this like white spherical object that is and I carrying what happened. Very then puts it into a bag. Of she approaches Caravan. Just like everybody, everybody about food.

01:13:46

I don't know, I have one last big purchase to throw in. How much can your backup holding carry kit? The Grayson a lot.

01:14:00

Getting just second. I'll bring it because just as like a general supply case just so that we always have enough of everything in case we need it or in case like we need to bring someone extra with us, shotgun is going to buy three of every thing. So, just so, you know, I also have a handicap effect title, okay?

01:14:26

So the type 4 can hold 1500 pounds with. As long as it's not over 250 cubic feet in volume. You're talking about the polar gear you mean right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

01:15:32

The bag itself actually weighs 60 pounds, which almost put me over later box up.

01:16:02

While we're in college guard, when it's not crafting great little spend a decent amount of time. Over at Kelda's clan. Hold place hanging around her. And then also some extra time sewing. Something is the magic for on the side. He's actually going to give to a makeup or I killed.

01:16:32

It is so smitten with grace in at this point that the first time one of the open tries to mock you for women's work. The legends. Him unconscious. That's incredible by my plan to get her. So into the group that if Grayson dies, I can come back as Kelda's working.

01:16:56

Tricky.

01:17:04

So I've been remember, right? She's actually staying behind with Calsbury.

01:17:10

That's so much tucker into coming. I think we have talked about maybe doing that but I don't think we'd ever actually gone ahead and let's try the AP. Doesn't expect you to keep her around, but she's not normally a caravan member, but you guys, you guys should have decent amount of interest to her.

01:17:30

So, if he was Google Indigo,

01:17:37

I mean the shoes. Well in the to come along, I don't see why we would. Another strong arm is always useful in Caribbean.

01:17:49

Mosakos. We want to come on the fights in the foreign land. And eventually again, got some glory and a place where you can't even pronounce the beer menu and that sounds like you, I mean, it's already like signed up at that point.

01:18:09

Even though we're signing a contract with Sandro, as you put it and it's great. Yeah, that is like Oh no don't do that. There's no some her tree.

01:18:26

Okay. And how do you windy kind of look familiar aspect?

01:18:33

I would mean The improved familiar. What about it? I don't know.

01:18:52

Is anybody asking person sort of scene forgetting your new familiar? Like, are you? I mean, I'm It's up to you, whatever you decide you want to do. I have a question while you marinate on that for everybody else. Does anybody else getting iterative attacks yet? Because I'm my brain is melting trying to figure out how to incorporate this into the way that I built my two weapon fighting so far.

01:19:26

Grayson, you attack like seven times. How are you doing years? Just automatically. What's that in the attack? Yeah you say either single attack or toilet packet, if it's full of packet does all from the menu when you use it immediately private rules and see what happens. And if you're mining the iterative attack formula, if you create a standard weapon effect formula, you should be able to copy it out of there and post it into your iterative attack selections.

01:20:02

Oh it. All right.

01:20:36

Grayson, do you care? If I go peek at how yours and set up real quick that go for it. I didn't actually change anything from the default settings.

01:20:52

Oh if you're trying to add a tax because it's not doing, it's not doing iterives like the formulas in there under my thing. But I think at the action usage that I haven't set up under something, I just wanted to look at yours to compare to be like okay the in the attack in the combat thing on the second tab called Details.

01:21:16

There's a pick at the top that says, actions attack, If you go into that and then under action on that next up. There's eventually a thing that says like extra attacks. Yeah, that's what I was looking at. If I hit that extra add extra attack button, it doesn't do anything and I see the formula built in for the -5, iterative, but like if I click anywhere in there, it doesn't let me do anything.

01:21:43

Of course, I don't know. Now it is never mind.

01:21:53

But it just got these like error messages saying that the formula was incorrect on Ochi's cheat. Yep. Magic.

01:23:17

Well, I'm open. Yep. That leaves me with just over 1k gold, which I'll Hold on to just in case we need gold on the road or something.

01:24:02

This cuz you never know any knit that diamond we have found. That was worth 300. I had put that in the say section on our loop list for Bitcoin. Needs it for a really important spell or something by maybe one of your lives. Exactly.

01:24:25

So if anybody's a thousand gold short of something, then I'm willing to throw that in.

01:24:45

This, how is everyone looking on their shopping? I'm pretty much that's happening. I'm also pretty much done everything I wanted to do. I think that once I swing with my wave blade, I think it's I think it's still one too high. Does it, does it still say that I have weapon focus?

01:25:09

No, it doesn't. Okay, never mind.

01:25:15

Then yeah, I'm good. I'm sure you're selling off your waveblade. I changed it out for a different one. It's all the spell storing one and got one.

01:25:43

All right. So, it was looking good. Yes, I'm done. Also, I'm just working on the attacks.

01:27:14

Please give me a working with that blog.

01:27:35

We brought back.

01:28:02

Import.

01:28:24

Are you getting stuck on? Oh fans.

01:28:53

Welcome back. I had to go see the dog food herself.

01:29:20

Okay, I think I got it. Figured out, We did it. Good job. Team Mission accomplished. I have a random question actually Has anybody's like devotion increased with their NPC, pull your devotion can increase the cross several MPC, Speaking of on what you do. I have the thing that I wanted to give to Sandru for like five sessions and I keep forgetting, I got him some loaded dice and I want a gift those to him.

01:30:05

Oh, oh yeah. You, Where are they? I think they're on my horse. They are. They're on my horse monthly or so, the actual physical item that I purchased like out of the Compendium because I didn't find those anywhere was loaded shell game cups, but What flavoring that? They're loving dice.

01:30:35

So, I hope to start one for Keldeck.

01:30:41

Everyone got beat points with Omei. Oh, you have all gotten 5 points with Koya. I'm not sure about that one. I think I should get a couple minuses for her constantly having to burn all her spells. Lots on me. I think you must understand quit, like,

01:31:06

He enjoys taking care of people and picking your movements OG has gotten one with Sandra now. Yeah, he's just like Sandru. I found these in town and I thought you would really like them. Check this out. Any rolls them like four times and they keep doing like sevens. And everyone has gotten free from course layloo for about me by the kind of got here.

01:31:45

Actually, that's very you would actually only get two because you weren't here for the crab. Speaking of OG during all this like at some point in front of people, it's gonna ask Zeo. So You've been with us for a little while now and you were trapped on that ship.

01:32:05

But did you plan on coming with us? I think we could really use your out. I mean I was always gonna come with you guys. I think it'd be best then if we maybe see if the seal will accept you as a Scion. Also, at the be very helpful.

01:32:25

Is that something that the box can just give out like that? Oh, and oh, cheese brain because it only is two brain cells fighting for last place. Remembers that if we open the box to let him touch it to make him a scion, that they'll know where we are again.

01:32:44

Compare, I think they already. Do You have what? No way of knowing. Actually more considering that they sent a lightning storm to zap the ship that we were on. That wasn't the only that was woad. Oh he's also the one that killed the birds that were talking to you.

01:33:07

So let's open that dialogue. Then What do you guys think? Should we open the box and have Zeo become a Scion? Also with it will accept him.

01:33:24

And that's on our currently with one away. Is the the sphere bone? I think that maybe this is like happening at the end in town because we're not at this campsite anymore, right? We're back in Cal's guard. Probably in our rooms at the end of the day, like everybody's gone out and done their, their business.

01:33:48

So picture picture that perhaps well, If they don't think that we're here, then I'd rather not risk it myself.

01:34:03

Not that it's my list. But my time eco suggestion. Of course, I have you considered asking the other imperial treasure? I'm just probably has them insight into that. That is a very, very good point. And I want to raise this. I lost a foundry chat. Did we just clear that?

01:34:23

Or am I cleared out the checkpat? Yeah. Because I had 4,000 OG rolls in there. They do tend to get official tablet like a So I will reach out and knock on the mental door of suation. Hey, I don't know what hours you can. Do you sleep? I do not.

01:34:53

Terrifying. We have one with us who was not a part of the original. He's not a Scion. Like like we are yet. We were discussing opening the warding box and seeing if the seal would accept him your thoughts,

01:35:18

Mmm.

01:35:25

It is obviously dangerous to open the rewarding club box but in all likelihood The only of the storms already know of your presence in Calsguard. So if you were going to open it again, now would be the time and on the morrow we should set out. Yeah. So, he'll go to the Mako and ask her Zio's.

01:35:49

Helped us a great deal and it seems strange that he's not gifted with the same rights and responsibilities that we are we'd like your permission to open the box to see if the seal will grant him the same blessings. It's given us what we're calling, She says in a cup of sake in the back.

01:36:20

I told you she's there sipping on soccer and like whittling this like fun to bone. I have known zero since we were quite young. I trust them.

01:36:37

Let's do it then. So Archie's gone fish out, the warning box wherever the warning box is and gave everybody around and then ask zero if he thinks he's ready. This is a This is a responsibility to be sure. Make sure you want to do this. I've been ready. What's the worst that can happen?

01:37:04

I mean, I hadn't already happened already more bad things, OG gonna open the box,

01:37:18

Kind of a out of character thing. I think it's entertaining that like, oh yeah, let's let's make Geo and as well. But not a screw koi and the other NPCs stupid around. Just just it, I did think about that. We have quite a few NPCs with us and but I think you have been outside the room and because they weren't chosen.

01:37:39

I mean yeah, I was just trying to get some flavor rolling here. I don't think that's a terrible idea. I don't know what the book has to say on maybe making like the some of the more important caravan original NPCs genes Scions also because like you know, if they die, they just die here.

01:38:02

I mean I imagine this is quite those being like you're you're still the heroes everybody. Yeah. They're like we know this story. Yeah. You guys are very important. Is what they're telling us.

01:38:22

Here to take great pleasure. And now we're just being like oh, I know I would say character. I mean, what do you guys think about that? Should we bring Sandrew and Coya up also and see if the seal accepts them.

01:38:36

Well, as if we're opening it we might as well see. Among us is his judged worthy by the does Morse code. Does Morse code exist in the Pathfinder universe out. There's something similar to it. Yeah. Could we send like a code? Fuck you to the only by like, opening the box like beep, beep.

01:39:01

Beep, beep, beep, beep. Like type like a, like a telegraph. Yeah, I'm gonna tell you right now that doing something like that, will provoke a much stronger and quicker reaction. This it's just a thought. This is an out of character thought this is not. We're not doing that. I don't think it would be a good idea.

01:39:21

Haunt them. I don't know if that would just piss off the seal, but they hunts just like we would actually, and after like the fourth one, it's like none of your fucking style anymore. I would just love to like, send them a message. It's like, you guys really suck at this.

01:39:38

How many years has it taken you to even find a mako? They were very, very valuable. All right, though. You open the box and we'll say that everyone who is in this room is in there. I don't think I have vision. Oh no. That's the lights. We're doing the.

01:40:06

There's the there's a very stark like I can see the outlines of all the lights in this room and then like total darkness. There's no in between dim light. I don't even notice that. I should have spoke over earlier.

01:40:31

Which,

01:40:43

That's better. That means the low lay. It light vision is probably disabled on all of those lights. It is yay and I don't want to go individual. No big deal. All right, I am at back of book again. Everyone in this goddamn room blacked out, as soon as the box is opened, Well, we get a new cutscene.

01:41:08

I thought it was just gonna play the same cutscene. Oh, it is going to play the same cutscene but see a couple of you haven't seen the cutscene mmm. Okay, in divisions the PCC and Army of terrible themes with burning skin glaring, eyes and sharp cuts wearing strange armor and wielding exotic weapons emerge and a storm from a vast forest.

01:41:33

Then descend upon a nation populated by Tian people. This vision is totally followed by another a young man dressed in royal rogue stands over a simple. Well, a friend at his side, Suddenly the friend grows three times insides and achieved enough, brightening suit of Jade Armor, the Jade Warrior draws these sword and strikes down with royal friends, then holds the bloody sore sword, a loft and Triumph a third vision follows.

01:42:00

This time of a young Tiong man. Handing a beautiful sword to a richly dressed open van in exchange for a bag of gold that you now recognize and Matsui Finally. This vision fades and you see your friend Omega awaking from a deep sleep but she is dressed in the finery of an empress.

01:42:20

He rises from sleep, not in the humble wrists and caravan but resting from arresting spot. Within the arms of a jade throne, These visions pass in the span of a few heartbeats. And after they do knowledge is imparted into your mind? You are shown a land. We're showing the land that you saw invaded by fiends and know that it is Minkai but the man that you saw murdered by the Jade Warrior was Emperor Shiguri of Mingkai, you know that I might Amico's kaijitsu's true family name.

01:42:55

It's Amitatsu, one of the five royal families of Minkai Indeed. The last surviving royal family. You recognize the young Kian men with the sword as Amico's, grandfather, Rokujitsu, formerly Amitatsus, Toku selling the families legendary sword to the open merchant a young thin, sniveled, who looked quite hail and hearty in in his youth.

01:43:22

Who sell and finance their flight and exile.

01:43:33

But they're more, you learn all of the powers and abilities of both the Omitatsu seal and its warding b including the danger of leading leaving the warning box open, which would allow the only of the five storms to. Once more attract the own clouds, conceal.

01:43:50

You know, I'm scroll down to the items game actually.

01:44:03

Mission observer.

01:44:13

Learning bongs.

01:44:20

And everyone see the items on the items tab in the items folder.

01:44:28

Items.

01:44:39

Oh yes. Yes, Yes, Yep. Both the Yamas out to seal and the wording block through in there and I think you guys sold dancing wasps didn't do, I'm pretty sure we did. I don't think anybody could really use it. That was a cool weapon. It wasn't that a cool weapon.

01:45:03

Yeah up on reading that but it's a really reliable way to get a hold of one thing. I'm glad that's really good.

01:45:15

It was literally the session before you joined, I think. Yep. Shruger. No, I think I was here for that when we got that. No, you no. That was at the end of book one. Oh, okay. We finished that fight ended. The session started. The next session came upstairs. And that's when.

01:45:37

No way joined the party. Hey guys. You were possible about. Yeah, so I know we have Sweden. Do we still have that other katana? The one we've got in walkies Ashim whispering shrike. Yeah, We have an addressed it in a very long time, I don't think it ever went on the loot sheet and was ever sold.

01:46:00

No, I think I think you took it from got them already. We don't forget his name. Yeah, we kind of like just assumed that that happened. I don't have it on my sheep, but we could pull it up and this is a great time to address this. Did we ever find the thing in the pommel?

01:46:20

I feel like that's where we got the letter, right? Yes. Okay, I just wanted to make sure because I saw it because I looked up the stat block, and then I felt bad because it's spoiled something for me that I forgot even happened. So,

01:46:37

The Whispering strike you also on the Adams invale,

01:46:51

And it is set to whoever wants to take you can put on their sheet. Yeah, it's pretty dope. A little weapon, I think it was disgusted that OG was a little too fragile to get much. You thought of the way? Yeah, so that you were you were really invested in you doing your two weapon fighting thing.

01:47:14

Yeah. And like I already took weapon focus with the specific weapon. Like and I was the whole thing. I could be more effective as a character if I just used a katana. But I'm pretty dedicated to this whole schtick of like the two sticks, the two stabbers inside of the stick.

01:47:35

What you mean? That weapon pockets for that specific weapon. Not that one, the one that I use the double walking stick katana.

01:47:45

Which means you have weapon focus boards. A double weapons group. All right. That's yeah. Yeah. Anything in the room. Yeah, I don't use any other weapons so like you know, just put it up and sheet and then use those two weapon.

01:48:10

Yeah, we have a cool pretty sword.

01:48:17

Okay. I'm Did anyone? Let me get it fixed. Yes, yeah. The I remember the characters named The other guy who was with us at the beginning, he paid debit prepared and said

01:48:37

He had I could say that. Instead of, if the, if I'm allowed to enchant it like instead of buying this wave blade, I could have just had agile put on whispering strike and taken that as my lesson. We have the question. Are you people using Wakasaki?

01:49:01

It is an exotic equipment. That is a very good question. Is it aren't or Kizashi Marshall? It's exotic interesting. Certain classes classify them as like certain Eastern as that they said, weapons as being auto. But generally speaking to most of Galarian, they are in the exotic and it is not a month, right?

01:49:32

No. Nope. Sorry. Yeah, I specifically took the swashbuckler archetype that would let me use an unk weapons. I was helping you would let me use some of the weapons. We found in this campaign, but oh it will. It's not the Katana or what was lasting.

01:49:52

There will be plenty of other weapons. Like I know there's a nine ring broadsword At some point in this book that you will really enjoy. That's cool. Specifically probably you can't use that with oh button. Press something like button. You got a cool wave blade with the monk weapon.

01:50:12

And then by some it would be terrible if we didn't have someone who specialized in sewing, could make magical leaf. Yeah, you put effortless lace on it, to make it a light weapon because it is a. Well, You can just slap people with a giant meat cleaver of a sore 2.5 K.

01:50:36

You can transform one weapon from being one-handed to being a light category. Western it is very nice. It's kind of what I did with my katana and the perfect game, and yes.

01:50:57

So how do you feel Zio? I feel pretty good. I might have missed a little bit of the after all the stuff was said to the box for me to be on phones that identity here after that. So I don't know what else happened. It's in the recap that I've dropped I can drop the cutscene or I mean sands also has it.

01:51:19

I'm sure because you just read it off but it just it it gives you the knowledge of what went down and why I make those the the rifle air. And also we have if you want to read them, the Amitatsu seal and the watering boxer in the item tab so you can read on them later.

01:51:40

I never think by the way, that effortless slaves requires craft magic arms and armor, not crap wonders I would like it. It's actually an arms and armor piece. Yeah, they don't want people expensive. It's funny. 500 gold, I think. 2500, how does Andrew feel Has he had this information?

01:52:07

Obviously, he's been communicated to him, but now it's been communicated to him. He kind of just danced into a corner and packs, his pipe things to himself a little bit. Were a little bit.

01:52:29

Just thinks how ironic it is that Makos. Like a like Empress. Yeah. Those little girl that he has always felt like an older brother too but he's good. Thank you. Gonna need a minute. Let's see what's amazing. Okay, by the small bottle of vodka, I don't know. She thought OG slamson box closed, I can't get back on the mountain.

01:53:01

I'm outside a shopko after the flash shoko stepped out and immediately went to the balcony. Did you get off the balcony? I don't know how magic sugar fell off the bull honey. So I mean we've done all our shopping, we made all these new friends Scions also. So we've got like eight chances to get someone on the throne.

01:53:31

That isn't an only, I think we're range of role. Are we at the end of our weeks of preparations?

01:53:42

That actually would be something that I would actually ask Tennessee at some point and just throw it. Okay. What what was the situation in mankind? Just so I can get my head around exactly what we're getting into, like updated the story of everything that happened.

01:54:09

I wish to understand the current political system so that I know if there's any weaknesses and people that we should be avoiding, what we're kept all that stuff back in on this. Well, Here's something to think about. We can start with the man in green. Hold on one second here.

01:54:30

I'd like to pause and make a note. We can telepathically communicate with Suey. Shin, right? All of you can now. Can we hear each other when we telepathically communicate with him? No. So it's only a, he broadcasts on one frequency and we all receive an individually, Right? Dang it, but since you're in private, you can also speak out loud includes.

01:55:00

I don't need more voices in my head. What?

01:55:10

The ranks sucker.

01:55:14

Sandra, how are the preparations with the caravan going?

01:55:21

And of smooths down his his mustache and beard. They are Well in half, leave on tomorrow.

01:55:39

Has your business, been concluded? Shoko? I know We were happy to accommodate the extra day. I just want to make sure that when I'm cutting anything short, we really should be moving on those five.

01:55:54

It's just maybe a good time for this. I may go. I actually have something for you. Oh Grayson reaches those packing, he pulls out a large fold like fine silk cloth Ochi might actually recognize this as we got some fine TN silk. I think it was back in the cave in book one.

01:56:18

Yes. I was like, I bet you. He's gonna have kept one of the like bits of yeah, whatever. I was like, here we go. Yes, he did. And he holds it over to the Mako and I'm going to unfurls, it looks like it's a kind of like a pendant, like flag pendant sort of thing and on the upper half of it is stitched in kind of a rusty color.

01:56:48

Kind of the design of a dragon kind of in a mix between the Tian style and restive glarian style, like imagery of it. The kind of signify her her in, where she came from, in the middle. There's some almost look like the bars of like music notes, but there's an actual notes on them and they're kind of in like a wavy pattern around and then on the bottom it's it's a empty and it's like there's still more space for more story to put on there but we can keep working on it as as you.

01:57:31

You like that's a really beautiful piece. Grayson, Is that the silk that we found back in Brian, stump marsh? And as a matter of fact, it is that's really fantastic. Is this a musical staff? Where the, where the notes go? Yeah, unfortunately I don't know anything about music or what notes would in what the bar would go anywhere.

01:58:00

So I didn't try to mess it up with just guessing. No, you did very well some on there that you would like and just just let me know and I can put them in the right spot for you. It's very fine work. And then yeah, like put song of storms on there, you know.

01:58:18

Well, she kind of just look at the beautiful work you've done.

01:58:26

She looks, he goes through like a flurry of emotion because her first time, being an adventurer ended ended in great tragedy. For those of you who know what may go story?

01:58:44

And She kind of sets the the item on the bed next to her and runs over and gives you a hug recent. Extremely awkwardly returns the hug with his six charisma. It's very awkward.

01:59:07

And kind of wiped your eyes a little bit mumbles that she's gonna go. And put this on, Is it a piece of clothing? Or is it like a flag? Like a tapestry, like a flag type of shirt, right? Of the kimono kind of in. No, not come. Alright, that's greasen doesn't know.

01:59:25

Anything about Tian stuff. So he wouldn't know what? Like how to sew a kimono or anything like that. Yeah. It's like a storyboard by banner Saga style. Thing is just not as ridiculously long, very neat. Then she just politely excuses herself to use the washroom for a minute. Everybody get prepared.

01:59:50

She's probably going to be kidnapped from the bathroom.

01:59:58

Yeah, I'm trying not to drink doesn't laugh. We should really have someone with her like, at all times. I'm not trying to do another Raven. Sure. It has been doing sword lessons with you every night over the last two weeks, and she might be as good with a katana.

02:00:15

Now, as you are, that's not super difficult. We've all seen and right during your guys's training sessions. She seems to be communicating with the sword and making corrections to her stance and style as you guys train.

02:00:36

That's rad. She's getting really good. We now has swashbuckler. Bead means yo, that's not the level estimates terrifying.

02:00:55

And then I mean, that's you guys have seen how effective that is roughly Amako's. Just arcane strike, precise strike Perry. Yes, actually. Yeah, like being strike. Yeah, precise strike. Yep. She knows a truck others though, that will will come up as you go and she's want some bush. Turning, you know we're about and if she wants, sometimes I ambush trading.

02:01:33

You also know where I'm at. Doesn't in fact? What a lot of anti ambush training. Yeah. Yeah. Get her. Some uncanny Dodge please. During her training weigh, young actually joins in and him and the Miko seemed to be communicating telepathically.

02:01:59

She's a ruse truly watching over Lady. Amako.

02:02:09

Okay, don't you talks everybody into bed, so we can lead town.

02:02:16

He says I hate it here. I've never coming back.

02:02:23

Banks. Um, so I'm sorry Didian. I've been The little red thing next to your name that you're not taking the end right now. I'm not all that used to discord. Well, I do have do not disturb on. Okay. That's I'm sorry, I would imagine, I don't want to speak for Didion but that's the other people don't message them a bunch like, while he's running games but I've totally DM the more we're playing.

02:02:59

Yeah, I do usually see the the little number pop up on my task bar, but I've been researching and get in the story up because someone asked to know suey for the extent of everything. Sorry. Bubba bum. If you like you, yeah because when Shoko hears or ask that you will step in and start talking,

02:03:41

I'm in about three woods in. If you start talking noise just gonna stuff and be like. And since, when is your name being related to swordplay and why would you notice

02:03:58

Because I was there.

02:04:09

But we doing

02:04:14

How old are you? I can press actually don't know that much about any of you though, you know. It me. Now Why don't we all need Happy Birthday and start sharing before. I start stopping. This is a joke it's a bad test one but it is a bill you mind if I wait until I'm.

02:04:37

Okay, comes back in.

02:04:41

Oh yeah. Already know some of the details. Let's, The current Jade regions is named Soto hero.

02:04:58

And shall go what'll say that. That's what he would tell them with.

02:05:08

Yeah, but yeah. He's just going to you'll notice that both of the times that he's watched talking hero, murder, that man by the well, Stokgo immediately had to excuse himself in the room.

02:05:43

Some of the reason why when I was like just pressing at this point is like okay, come on. Every time I'm gonna go does come back after a little bit Compose pencils. Wait, maybe a discover now. Going to have more revelations, So,

02:06:15

Told you before, my audience was born in raised in Mankai different and never told you what I was and truth, I was born and raised in the capital.

02:06:36

The Imperial Palace.

02:06:42

My father was

02:06:51

He led the Imperial procession of musicians and he was director of court music.

02:07:07

I, Grow up.

02:07:15

Somewhat nearby lakes. And, and man, who was supposed be trustworthy, You knew the Emperor.

02:07:37

Stuck on the odds. I was seen as a curiosity. Preacher before us who was bounds, you know, mystical pawns by nobility of by a nobleman of the court and taken in as a son. You're not, you're not that strange looking? Why would they do that?

02:08:11

That was a sick burn. No, I just more amount of mists begin soon. Develop shuffle. Wow, the little stranger that I probably went on by now.

02:08:35

As a four-tailed pizza and a stands worship at Winstead.

02:08:50

Well, that's that's very new. Wait, a substitute. Did you know about this? I've known him for decades. How old are you? Me, I'm 64 not you Koya. We know, shoko. And,

02:09:21

Just a bit younger than that.

02:09:26

I won't hold it against you old friend.

02:09:32

The grain fox miles. Sadly. Well what's why the secrecy then?

02:09:43

A multi-tailed. It's a from what the mean. Cayenne accents, who happens to play. The Taikodorum hearing out of nowhere on the other side of the world, I was fucking hero. Didn't want remnants of the old courts, especially, not those who saw what he did. Just wandering around. That makes a great deal sense.

02:10:16

Can I ask if you have Is it possible to throw up a full page art of the art in the token now? Because it looks really sick but some of its covered by buffs.

02:10:30

Hmm, kind of

02:10:39

I'm just trying to mire the character. Don't go scenes, incredibly uncomfortable.

02:10:53

You are the first people other than other shown this in decades.

02:11:05

That's rad. So that like knowing it would put down, put down her little carding that you're doing. Thanks for glasses. Post them in the pocket and that does very sternly and I was kind of walk. Someone's showco. And After a quick squint just holds out of hand and says, well, it's a pleasure to finally meet you properly.

02:11:40

I thought you were a little bit odd. Yeah. Say you have a bit of a shifty air about you, but reach out and shape your hands. I think that makes sense and is the continues ability to change into human form. What is, what does that tip form? Does that take mechanically like a spelled likeability to to change into a human performance?

02:12:13

Is it a specialist? It's an extrovertise or natural. Yes, it's supernatural. So I don't think I'd have been able to detect it with my cool tattoo that I got. So that makes no, it's not a lucery. It's actual transformation. That's radical transformation in the skyline. Which is part of the reason why I like to pick one of those kind of like, All right, because Ochi would have been, like, kind of alarmed that you were able to shift in front of him whole box for.

02:12:42

Yeah, I was a like I would have been really alarmed as he changed that I wasn't able to like detect that because I spent all that time and money with Koya. Getting that cool tattoo. He's like, oh, yeah, this thing doesn't even work. You know, I mean, I assume like choker, you're the skies I assume is like really good after like because you get a hand on checks to appear human just in general.

02:13:15

On top of his already horses already checked in or s plus 13. So, plus 23. So, I automatically know that you're in disguise, but I've never known. Why interdesting notice thing is that she is really good for counselors and because she finds people that are trying to hide. Yeah, no, that's speech.

02:13:41

Isn't that frozen shadows? Good. It's gonna absolutely have. No use from this point on. I mean, I should own it when we talked about it but like today like we're gonna the the disguise you would have known about and then worry about to go out in the cold. Right after that.

02:14:00

I'm like, those are never gonna come up and it's just you, like I knew the whole time, I don't feel the cold but Hawaiian holy over here just so, But yeah. No. And I want to apologize to all of you. I, Shoko's demeanor and voice is changed a little bit actually now that he's drops.

02:14:33

The other persona friend for Soma while skins are actually

02:14:47

And by it's just been hiding so long that it became hard to take it off, even around people. I knew you look the same to me my friend. I'm glad that you feel that you can trust us like this. We've got a long way to go together and I think you'll be warmer in this way.

02:15:22

Program. Right side. It's not like you have to kill those now, right? Miami. But the doubt I could,

02:15:38

You're the only one of us who stood toe-toe with Kevin Dotsu so I don't know about all that.

02:15:48

Which I'm still surprised you could do with those noodles though. I don't think she's going. Yeah she says by the way that like as shoko Shoko was like averagely built in his human form but now that you're looking at his true keeps anecil. He is swallow battery. Clearly whites lanky and wobbly and a little sickly looking.

02:16:18

And his earlier remarks about being born fragile, kind of ring a bit truer.

02:16:31

That was probably one of the things that gave away that he wasn't quite what he seemed snowy. Is that his gates and physicality didn't quite match? What his appearance would say, would suggest the exact phrase I'd like to use as walking around in a spin that isn't yours.

02:16:53

Yeah. Yeah. That about accurately sums it up Shelco is actually based on. So older gentlemen, that I traveled with across the crown of the world E. Didn't quite make it all the way here. And I sort of talk that form to give myself a little bit of is strength.

02:17:32

Yours is a truly compelling story.

02:17:37

We're glad to have you with us for not. I'm just glancing though. I'm not the only liar instead. Yeah, I wonder who's big revelation is next. I tell you, I was going to tell you all after you told us in norway, but I wanted to wait until the last few dollar makeup.

02:18:01

No, that's probably for the best. I can understand that much of the release. Then for what it's worth. I like to think that I know how you feel Well, maybe, and then shoko, turn to look at Omega herself. So, lady on the cow, will you forgive my to see?

02:18:32

And will you still have me on as your retainer?

02:18:41

You should never pass up on a drummer. Like don't pass up on a drummer. They're really hard to get a hold of. Also, Now bear with me on this one, he's so fluffy now. Personally, I do not find it. A slight of someone shoots is not to share everything about themselves.

02:19:04

Prejudice runs rampant and a lot of places in Avistan. So OG thinks about how he's been sharing, his whole life story with a Mako, every time they had been sore training and like feels bad. Every time introduces himself, like a samurai just like my name is Uchi. Yeah, exactly.

02:19:24

Just like this one time. My dad and he took me to go here and like just all the time. Oh my god, I'm going to throw knives at you. Next time, I will not hold the grudge against you for keeping us to yourself.

02:19:43

Choco smiles and nods and Right. I think I still currently hold the record for greatest. Revelation of secrecy made. You can say that again, I don't know. I don't know. Your three sizes yet, be kind of words and i've broke it.

02:20:07

Oh, come on. I'm trying to inject some light humor into this otherwise. Dowry situation. What he want from me.

02:20:16

But obviously like teaching in at this point she's being kind of quiet and dorm philosophy days and she's like pleasantly drunk, I think a drink does. Oh, she's gonna walk over to Koya and like poker a few times history. You're not like secretly a cat, are you? No, I'm secretly.

02:20:38

Does that This would explain much. Oh gee like laughs at first but then he thinks about it a little bit and then he stops laughing.

02:20:51

But yeah like works up finger at you tell you a secret OG leads in and then she changes into a much smaller version and younger version of herself to milfoya instead of Jilfoya it completely true.

02:21:14

I'm getting terrible at this and then laughing, keep returns to her normal form. Did did my tattoo go off when she cast illusion to do that? Actually, I don't that's delicious either. What? The koi? I want my money back, it's if it's Here. We could we could test it out.

02:21:37

I've been lied to by half the people with this room.

02:21:44

Influence. Transmutation spelled with here. Oh she's gonna read a lot. More about magic tonight. Keep shifting an illusion was not the same thing.

02:22:04

Oh, Before I forget when we get back to the and terribly, dramatic topic of what exactly is going on in time, I'm sorry, Sugar, did you say that that's your much, your name?

02:22:29

And no, it's just going to leave it at that. Just like, okay, it goes back to wickling to show. Do I just call you showco? Still, I would. Yes. Okay.

02:22:46

Names. Are it matter? He's gonna put Grace in next blessing. Was already a freak of nature. Don't bother. Maybe he's like a rock guy or something. Maybe that's why his legs are so stiff and hard. Please rephrase that an orient that yeah. One of those. Oh, she's gonna poke himself.

02:23:14

Sorry. Okay. I am what you see good because I like you this way. I was a lot of change. Happening for your your tattoo, You can use disguise self to become someone else, right? Is. Yes, you can use it as a booster with the sky check. Okay, then you're looking at a somewhat crew version of yourself looking back at you but those might hear that too glow.

02:23:46

Oh she looks at him. The way that a bird would look at a mirror. Like really confused with his head cocked? Yes, exactly. Yeah let's let's see if I could match your movements enough to fool you into thinking. You're actually looking at your reflection. That would be the check for that.

02:24:02

The sky's open bluff. Noah looks at her. Glass looks at Sandra. Looks back at a few buds. How would you give this one by drunk Institute birds over there? Right. Yep. They had to do.

02:24:26

So it looks super real and convincing. So, do you like put them in a gladiatorial arena and only one of them can leave, but we had like 50 birds at Ravens crack and there wasn't like a highway all of them. And then before that in Brian wall, notice that shippo casted.

02:24:49

This guy's self without any comments. Just the typical magical swirlies or what how to get so low on your disguise by all the four. Oh, okay. So that's a 27. You didn't put in the plus 10, but I think the plus 10 is just to appear human. Yeah, it's only for a bearing given.

02:25:14

Yeah. No you Nope it. Do you use this spell to create a disguise? You got a plus 10 bonus on the sky. Check. Yeah. Oh it's kind of oh yeah this guy something that's oh yeah.

02:25:36

Oh well, no Sandro. Okay. Yeah.

02:25:43

That's really good. That would pull, most of the people of Magmar.

02:25:52

All right, all right, all right. Literally everyone. Now I need to fail. This Batman, it's a private role against it. Pick up. Sorry. Well, out there is room of other seventh old chairs. What? It's a really good. Check squints But OG didn't actually make it. So yes it looks like he's looking a mirror everyone except for Ochi sees right through it.

02:26:28

Oh, she's like, Wow, I don't real quick items of the Amapatsu ladies and gentlemen, but you know, there it is. To kind of like looks like a oh well Well it looks very impressed. Well done. You can rest assured. That's anybody who tries to impersonate. One of us will of a high hurdle to clear British are at this point.

02:26:58

We're all kind of on guard against that. Yeah, Also Sandra has not looked like he felt like sharing his dark. Secret Sandra has a dark secret. Of course he has a dark secret. He's what Paul handsome and drinks profusely. I have a lot to learn.

02:27:34

I think that's enough secrets for one night. Yeah.

02:27:40

I'm gonna help. Well, the crown of the world.

02:27:47

We're going on an adventure. People are going on an adventure. We're going on a road trip. All right, we're going to take our break here. We ran a little past, their break time. All right. And I really need to be snack time, you know. I'm assuming that and at least one of you at some point, a crapped open Shoko's character sheet, and saw the big glaring, shape, shifters, humanoid heats in a that's literally three line sound from his name.

02:28:19

No. Okay. I try and make it an effort to not touch people's character sheets, unless they want me to. I did accidentally for the record. I don't care if anybody looks at always. Like, there's nothing on there. Literally don't already. I worked really hard, not to say anything about it and like not ever hint at it or anything.

02:28:46

So I apologize for seeing but I didn't realize that I see other people's character sheets. And I was just looking at everybody's attributes because I was like, damn everybody, it's more than me. And then I felt bad about it. After, you know, you, it's, it's more. These little guys, maybe there is a way, I could have hidden it better with like using an edit somewhere.

02:29:15

Yeah, I mean, when I when I went in on my character, I literally just just because I could change it to a you may notice that it changed it to say rogue and then in the actual notes of the thing, it says totally not a ninja totally.

02:29:34

That. That's yeah, that's part of a part of the other giveaway was every time I would be like I have plus one domain, enchantment DC and you guys are like from from spell focus and I was like, no, something like that. I don't know enough about spellcasters that I never would have known if I didn't see your character sheet.

02:29:58

I think I think my god, that was that you'd either taken and like spell focus enchantment or you were something that bought like an enchantment based DC bonusa, which there are many races. I'll be back. So actually have now I took that as one of my retrainings of wall here in house part.

02:30:25

Oh, I also got two magical tails grafted onto me which I guess I'll roleplay is saying, shoka, went to the J, Quarter found the local pizza, in a population and spent some time. Just meditating with them to getting in touch with his inner fox. I don't, I mean, you could, you could always just flip it at this point.

02:30:49

A band. Like you've always had them a distortion, but you haven't been like out of human forms, one that you've literally miscounted. How many tails you have? Yeah, that's that. That works too. Yeah, each way like look at them. Right? And I, I am out of character, very amused.

02:31:08

That I am not the only person who is lying for recently to the to the fight. Yes, X.

02:31:16

I will also get up.

02:35:58

Meep. Hey, amateur create them. Just barely beat you a little bit. Okay, I got paid my work. Making it look down. And I have the audience exit.

02:36:21

Noticeable. I told my be there in about half hour ago. Okay, so let me know when you leave. I guess I'll be leaving here in about 15 minutes.

02:36:35

All right. Hello. Every for Quite a roughly bit of RP. Actually, and a bit of harrowing logistics, you guys are prepared to set out on your trip, across the crown of the world.

02:37:01

Here.

02:37:19

In the best of conditions at a standard speed of 32 miles per day. An average caravan takes a minimum of 94 days or just over three months to make the journey across the crown of the world. And often takes half a year or more significant factor in most caravan masters decisions to make the crossing only once a year.

02:37:43

In the height of summer, your journey could take even over a year. You take breaks to craft magic items, explore or simply rest during your

02:38:02

Really wish they would just but the serves the PCs can know in the stuff they can't know in completely different sections, need it. And then, I mean, they get better, right?

02:38:33

Planet.

02:39:04

So after several days, traveled to the north

02:39:13

Yes, you cross over the rain thirst mountains, which make up the form, the frontier, for the crown of the world and enter into a rugged hilly. Country. The bloodstream, wind carved. Badlands and folded hills of urgeuk were once home to a collection of giant realms before they're inhabitants, relocated into the mountain peaks to establish grander lodges or migrated for other self and performer lands.

02:40:09

One of your days of traveled down the mountain roads.

02:40:19

People spot a hut often the distance often in the early morning. It will appear in a midst. Stay there for a short time before once again, vanishing

02:40:34

And on your third night, into the crown of the world, the hook comes in the view down the path that you are taking.

02:40:47

Hmm. No way. Is this something you're familiar with it? All that is indeed my next question. Jordy, give me a knowledge. Local. And I can certainly attempt you a knowledgeable.

02:41:07

Quickly. There are many legends across the open lands and the arithian lands that which is pets and move.

02:41:22

Yeah, Well that's far north. If You ever heard avoid, which is

02:41:35

You know those folktale legends of Crohn's and the like who like to set up shop and then decide to move and their shop. Also gets up and moots. Are you talking about somebody like Baba? Yaga?

02:41:53

Can I roll anything on white witches and brave of YouTube invoke her but no no. I just kind of succulents and those when she mentions winter which is or white witches, is there a different knowledge, check that we can roll on those. That would be a knowledge geography or local where the you have all been plenty of times in open lands to deal with local.

02:42:22

Okay, I wasn't gonna roll local because like I haven't been here that long, but if you're saying that works, I'd love to roll to on the huts or winter, which is or white witches. Yeah, you can roll another local. You spend weeks in Kel's guard, protein knows nothing. That is actually enough to know that the winter witches and the white witches of ear sin are the rolling body of a rival kingdom to the Lenormickings, Okay?

02:42:49

So and there are local legends in the north. About an old witch named Baba. Yaga who was said to be the mother of all witches. Also that she likes to eat children, we should not speak her name and which of years in do not like other people speaking her name.

02:43:14

It's just bad luck of which we have plenty and continue to invite more day on there though. It will admit literally running into a one of their, one of their huts is concerning.

02:43:39

We should say your question Grayson. Yes, I have heard of these things. No, I wouldn't want to pop with it. We should stay well away from that.

02:43:51

Which is, you know, a funny notion because it did appear directly in your past this time.

02:43:59

And what's the terrain? Like, how hard would it be to just go around it away and you can certainly go around the you are in hilly country right now. I vote, we go around it. The question is of does it will like follow us only one way to find out But I for one do not see the need to go straight into that thing.

02:44:31

We all need to think is we as we go through this noise just being like on top of one of the caravans the entire time like an idiot because This isn't cold. What are you talking about Hawaiian shirt? Blowing in the win? Yeah. Can we all agree to go around it?

02:44:52

At least, at first try.

02:44:59

Okay, we're going around it. Yep, sounds good.

02:45:06

Squints out of the entire time in the distance, you make your way around it and you are not bothered by the hut again that evening on the next day. It's once again, spotted off to the side in a swirl of mist, not in our path. But like appeared this time.

02:45:27

So here's a geography. Geographical question. Are we heading into the territory? That would be the witch's territory. Like are we heading into the crack of the world? For all anywhere you are, considers all of that very territory, it's cold, everything called belongs to them. Yeah, but but that's probably yaga other other winter, which is good.

02:45:53

Probably different. But The ground of the world doesn't technically belong to a nation.

02:46:03

We were yet.

02:46:08

It's something something that takes effort.

02:46:14

Well, I'm not gonna go messing with that thing. I learned from the giant bug hive that just mind my business. That's the day winds down again. Assuming you don't go towards it in the distance. Nope. That once again, appears ahead of you along the path. The path seems to lead right up to the Hut's door.

02:46:41

Apparently. There's something. Going out of this thing was first into. Okay, So once it's coincidence twice is bigger coincidence three times as enemy action, right? Well, there's no need to launch fireballs at it or anything like that. Let's approach approach cautiously.

02:47:07

Do you want me to go and check it out? Oh, gee takes off his backpack. Sticks it on its horse and tries to see if anybody else wants to go walk up and check it out with him leaving the caravan back aways in case of explosions or other magical fuckery you will go up go with you guys Christian world.

02:47:30

Well.

02:47:34

Vision. No, I like drops off the top of the caravan and doesn't sink into the snow.

02:47:49

Video will cast like there's a cat.

02:48:00

Oh, disability must be shit here.

02:48:06

Oh, that looks like my contain anything. There was a wall there.

02:48:13

Night is falling into approach but there is what looks like a welcome welcoming torch on the part.

02:48:26

The hut is slightly raised. You hear a goat? Leading in a pin. I want to roll perception. See if I hear any signs of a person around breathing footsteps blah because Ochi is freaked out.

02:48:51

You do hear the goats hanging out right over here but you don't hear anyone nearby you

02:49:05

No one's gonna do her thing. I'm just anyone stops her and calls a hand signal and just oops.

02:49:19

Whatever, my invisibility woman is though,

02:49:24

It's throughout go and check with us out. Is there like, any OT before Noah gets too far? It's gonna ask suician if he saw any of these witches hats on his way over or his encountered, anything like this before.

02:49:43

We did not encounter this crops now. Okay, go ahead.

02:50:02

What are your Ninja IC This woman stepping out of the door of the hut?

02:50:13

I don't I don't like this.

02:50:20

Oh, she's gonna get over here if anybody wants to come with him Shoko way in the back, hell friend.

02:50:33

Not showcas. Not back from brakes.

02:50:40

His most wonderful that you have come, leave. Come inside. The cookies are ready. Another baby that I got to ask. Is she what she thinks? I don't know what you mean. I am gonna point my tattoo at her. I don't know how it works but I'm gonna look it up real fast.

02:51:12

It's essentially detect magic, but only detects illusion.

02:51:22

As far as effect, she has going on her, you detect nothing. I was just rolling just to see if there was like and you shenanigans. We're here. We're your dice that cool translucent ice before because that looks how let's say. Now I don't know, I am back is there, who is, who is the elderly lady?

02:51:49

Yeah, I'm sorry. We thought you were back, witch hut The winter witch hut kept popping up in front of the path day one. It was in front of the path. We went around it day. Two. It was off to the side. We kept going day three towards the end of the day.

02:52:05

It popped up in the middle of the path again. So we came to check it out. Once is okay. A tactile from the third time from the. Nope. Like I said, once is an occurrence twice, it's coincidence. Three times as enemy option. So, ochi walks in and says, thank you for welcoming and welcoming us in.

02:52:32

Can.

02:52:37

It is good to come. She moves over here quick. Well, any point at the countertop, which is covered in various baked goods and candies,

02:52:58

From all over Glarion. Before we partake in any of these delicious looking big treats. I have to ask. Is there something? You feel you need to discuss with us? You, you and this abode of yours have been following us for three days, I assume you have something to say.

02:53:28

I find it very rude. Choco would have retaken his human form, but I do. Yes.

02:53:44

May, we know help yourself, so that's nice. I made them just for you and you have my word that they are not in any way. Negatively impactful upon your persons. Yeah, I'm gonna need a roll for that.

02:54:05

He's telling the truth. Greeting. Bullshit detector goes off. You both. He's telling the truth about the pastries. Yeah. Noah is staying invisible and is basically just acting as a mutual shadow at this point for them push. Oh, she's gonna pick up. Oh, she's gonna pick up a croissant and eat a croissant.

02:54:37

Truck over. Come El Bhavasacha, what brings you to the crown of the world.

02:54:49

So no one has told you that we were coming, You just spotted this along the way. We would like to share to be clear, But the nature of what we are doing and where we are going, is a bit of the importance with the final Amitat Scion to her home opening Tai, guess where she can become Empress.

02:55:07

Okay good. So you know, that's a huge relief. I'm not really gonna lie. Drawing swords Actually Ochi. I would say that that's the opposite of a huge relief. What would you say about Ezio? I just don't like lying. I don't like lying. What? Why? We're going? Whatever we were doing, intimate.

02:55:33

I But then again. What do I know? Oh, she's gonna sit down over here. We're very young.

02:55:50

Look, She wants she has something to say. It's gonna take us years to get all the way across the crown if she keeps putting the hut in the way. So,

02:56:10

What did you say your name was? Miss, You may call me Baba. Sacha. It's very nice to meet you Baba subject. I'm Orchidsuite Aarashi.

02:56:25

That should to meet you young Samurai. And I make a check on that name as well as perhaps any similarities to similar the mythological figures, OG like super puffs up and gets all big bird at being called the Samurai, he's like super stoked as the party recently discussed. You are aware of the name.

02:56:49

Baba Yaga. Because Theo said it quite loudly.

02:56:56

But Baba also just means old lady.

02:57:04

It. So do I know the news for grandma? So do I know specifically the name Baba Sasha?

02:57:12

I will let you roll knowledge nobility with a very high BC.

02:57:23

Mean well known, you're like I did not believe this bubble.

02:57:31

Man, we got they can give a shot.

02:57:38

Something actually framed, it wouldn't be something that I would know. Anyone he'll go, you think that might have been one of the noble names from the last era of the White Witches.

02:57:54

Will bring up Barbers. I feel like I recognize that name bird you with the white witches.

02:58:14

And in a way perhaps formerly or presently Also possibly in the future, it's gonna be one of those conversations. All right. Chef goes down. You remind me of my grandmother, he looks at Koya. Looks back to you. No, that's I'm that's not my grandmother. I get the impression that she's everybody's grandmother.

02:58:54

I mean, she barely older than me. So I should probably have looks a little sadder and you kind of kernels into himself a little bit. Well, Oh darling. Children are not always as much fun. As you might think, Miss Babasaccha. You clearly know why we are here. So we would just like to ask.

02:59:22

Why have you summoned us? Because I asked you what you plan to do,

02:59:32

Are you going to hunt down and destroy the only of the five storms?

02:59:41

Yes, kind of looking like, we probably won't have a choice on that. Even if we did, I would

02:59:57

Hunting them down right now. Being the smartest idea, though, might be easier to often come to us and want to rid. My homeland of these demons.

03:00:17

Opinion. And I suppose I should help you, we would appreciate an encroaching upon the north.

03:00:34

They are doing something.

03:00:43

What sides have you seen? That nay lines of the crown have fluctuated. Steadily shifting position.

03:01:04

What could they be doing here besides trying to capture or kill the lady of Miko? Again, this began before you real awoken. Those artifacts.

03:01:22

Maybe they got new roughly at the fall of the last emperor. Yes, they are change. Expand their territories, the five storms are not content with being Kai alone.

03:01:40

Well, I mean Good luck to them in striking out at the rest of Tianjah didn't exactly work out. Well, for the last folks who tried to control the whole place, will let me ask you a question. Like I said, I do plan to hunt the five storms until they are eradicated for what they've done.

03:02:01

But more importantly, I want to see my homeland freed first. If we take the time to hunt down and kill every Oni and every servant of anony between here and Ming Kai, a lady may come may be very very old before we get there.

03:02:23

He my question, is this, why should we take the time to stop and fight them? Now, when we could have an army in our backs in return later,

03:02:46

Have to deal with anything.

03:02:54

What do you mean? Is that harassing that or Yeah, I think I think would what Ochi's trying to get at. Is that it would it might be smarter to take out the Jane region when Minkai gather an army and then come back for the craft world and he's looking to be refuted on that.

03:03:25

Unless I am mistaken and this is rarely. So, the passive Egg & Heights blocked,

03:03:36

I unnatural storms, they're doing some file, work to block the passage.

03:03:47

I see plan and trade with Minka hasn't stopped. Has it. I look back to everyone. Has it. We were just in CalStar where there hadn't been any trades. Since winter began, people don't usually make the the check at this time of year.

03:04:11

So the way is blocked. What can we do to open it? Let's see what happened to discover on your own. My only concern was that you intended, your idea only of the five storms, believe you also offered help. I did.

03:04:36

Of the spiritual sort.

03:04:43

In a way that you are not capable of comprehending. Yes, adventure is must be tested after all.

03:04:55

And you hear what sounds like I drain Rebellion. Draconics breaching.

03:05:06

Resound through the air and I think some of you will actually get to see them from where you're at. A little leap to his feet. OG2, Nico would quite clearly hear.

03:05:30

And you see what appeared to be beautiful prostrates, but the energy coming off of them is more like the Aurora Borealis

03:05:49

Hello. And know, Zio has to leave early rolling about half an hour short. We're gonna go ahead and stop here. I right now. Hey, all combat will take this might be a pretty decent fight. Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry, they're frustrates templates. Okay.

03:06:22

And we will pick this up next week. Which sounds good will involve much more actual adventure? Yeah. Yeah. It's nice to have a cool off session with out much action in an outdoor, We just and they're there was a bunch of logistics that people where it is a long journey and you guys got out items crafted.

03:06:48

So it was the worthwhile session. So now and now you are going to be tested. Yeah, we are and then I'm gonna fight this fucking old lady.

03:07:03

Good, probably not. But sure, you can certainly try that. She will probably will be west. She'll break up the sandal. The OT is not capable of understanding that. She understands how souls work and gain power. She knows what experience points are.

03:07:29

Well, it's helping you. This was super fun. I was super sick to see the consuming transformation and like the new art. That was a really powerful thing. Very good super sick. Oh, thank you. I was kind of nervous about it. This happened sort of looking for a good place to put that in Ever since the beginning, are those mammoths?

03:08:00

I have such a large collection. Now of, I don't want this, I stuff these kids, I don't know that I honestly brush to prepare the prep last night and when I get to use one of them. Hmm. But we wouldn't have more encounters and traveling on the the world, but never survive.

03:08:26

Yeah, and just takes longer than I expected to. But, you know, you do have a very long check before you'll see another city where you can buy stuff. Yeah, no I'm glad we got all the stuff ironed out and the crafting is super awesome really. Appreciate Grayson taking that.

03:08:46

It'll be worthwhile in all the super sick fights were about to do. Yep. And I get to keep my eye out for interesting, crafting ingredients out of the ordinary, which there will be plenty actually. So this is, I will let you guys know right now that this entire book takes place in the crowd of the world, you guys get to explore and almost completely unexplored region and fun.

03:09:17

I after reading through the book, it does seem like a shit ton of fun. Actually, I'm just like they actually made it super interesting. Awesome like that when they very very good, the third AP book like this entire book takes place in the crown of the world. I was like, Oh God.

03:09:36

That's what he's gonna suck. But after reading through it it's amazing with the the caravan rules, a lot of people said this is where most people like start to die in this AP. So I've always been excited to get to this part where like I know it gets pretty rough and there are a lot of specific care venting counters, but I'm also rolling those encounters into your standard random encounters.

03:10:01

That's what I think is. A lot of those encounters are also story encounters like they can do stuff. Yeah. Like the catapult thing back in the key. Like I anticipated like something like that. Going on. And I think it's gonna be super fun. That was fun hook. Ray is a whole like piezo.

03:10:22

I think likes to make the third book to be your expeditionary book like saying it was but you in wrath. Its book. Three interest is it? Yes, I've only read through the book once like the theme that. So if it is actually, you have to explore and stuff. Yeah.

03:10:46

From what little I remember you can replace the entire campaign takes place in the crown of the world with the entire campaign takes place in this particular region of this particular bank. And like, it's, it's nonlinear on how it's progressed. But the thing that I'm thinking of is like, it doesn't, It can make a dessert with every book.

03:11:10

I mean with books string as well because that's not

03:11:18

I'm pretty sure curse. So has you leave Corbosaur book 3 So it's also a good words out A bunch of the APs like to do it in my book. Three to make you get out of here. No, that's book. Four, Is it before? I know it's not going to leave you finally promote a extended period of time.

03:11:40

Yeah, that's the simple ones one, isn't it? Yeah, looking forward to whatever that book is and God's too. I guess also kind of. Yeah, we're gonna come with that one. Yeah, that's a lot of I am gone. So but that's that's just cool because you get to check out cool places like they make every book always good for you.

03:12:09

Anyone here going to be joining us tonight. Unfortunately, I really, really, really want to play in another game, but my girlfriend would kill me. If I took another time slot like this and spent as much time as I spend on this game on another game or I would Iron God sounds really fun too.

03:12:31

I could play any of them. I'm like, super jealous of everybody who gets to play multiple games.

03:12:39

But before I forget, because two of you were and Well. Now, just because stuff for like, present stuff that's the thing. I thought we guys are done. We don't nearly have that done. We, you guys don't have it done. Me and shades are functionally. Complete. So I've been laid up in bed for a few days now, because you've been ill, I get it.

03:13:09

Like yeah, I'm just mentioning it now because if we take like this amount of time to do it at that game,

03:13:21

It doesn't actually take that long If you're unfamiliar with the rules. Give me a ping and I'm happy to help you work with what you want to like try and figure out all visualize, all be bad for work through. I actually have to get going. I just realized I may be late for something.

03:13:36

You need to double check a dice flame of y'all. See you later? Yeah, I'm gonna go to have a good week, everybody. That way, you guys can talk about that other stuff. Looking forward to dying next week Again. Oh gee, you think you're gonna die every week? I almost do die every week.
