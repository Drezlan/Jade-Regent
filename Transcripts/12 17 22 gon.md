00:00

And i don't really have anything to add to it. So,

00:07

Just really just not do much of anything during a dragon fight, they can, but it relies on the rest of the body doing other particular things, in order to allow them to do it with planet. We're doing no because they're limited by range so they don't get sneak attack.

00:23

Unless they're 30 feet and that's out in um they can't use invisibility or anything like that to get a dragon to you know, be not a dragon. Yeah, they're dragons. They're just dragons. Um he realistically need to flank them which is much easier to do. It is not going to happen because you're not fighting them in an enclosed space.

00:46

So, because of that, and because your plan revolves around being in the air, like, where's your silver dragon? Yeah, something. And they're gonna, they're gonna brawl out like to mythological gods from god of war. Apparently um, effects that somehow because we'll probably be fighting more dragons before. This AP is over and we won't probably and i will have solutions later on, but we are currently level seven.

01:21

So okay, that all sounded bright. How do i have a longbow in my inventory? How do i get it on the combat tab to destroy it? I don't want to make another one from scratch. I've made so many attacks from scratch. So you go to your inventory. Yeah, edit the weapon, got a details.

01:39

And then, on the way it says actions, just add an action. Um, or you can scroll a little bit leather down on the same tab, and where it says click attack, it will create the attack.

01:55

I'll just cry. I see the attack actions. I'm very familiar with that. Part under details. But how do i get it to go to the combat tab? So just click, oh my god, create attack. I see it now. I'm so sorry, guys. Okay. Ah, okay. We did it. Good job, everyone.

02:21

Uh the only thing from the loop list that might be useful. Well, major lease was that there is a cloak of resistance plus two. There's the cutest little black dragon. It is very cute. I already have cook so i will. Um, i will not put it resist plus 2, though.

02:44

We said yep, plus two. Into dasting is everybody already have a plus one. I think so. We've been getting a couple quite a few as loot so i would hopefully is got it. I think after she got poisoned back at the, i guess the fucking, uh, raven's cracked. Someone like put a cloak on her.

03:11

Yes. She's got a cloak resistant. Close to.

03:17

I'm walking on plus one.

03:21

Uh oh, do you want it since you're usually up in melee or actually shoko is too. So when the two of you or no way actually, well, i'm i'm already rocking over this. I'm supposed to. Um, the other thing that i do, remember this is this is more of a more of a meta comment, but we do know this because we did the dragon research.

03:41

Um, a dragon, this big has a tendency to make people just run in fear. Yes, i am going to fail that safe. I am, i'm not going to even try everything. That is not going to be um, social also on. Uh, well i mean i will be inspiring encouragile us.

04:13

Okay, just don't get within 100 and something read of it.

04:19

Technically that only activates accurates engaged, it does you, right? And it's definitely not going to to do anything that would consider itself being an engagement for this entire cup.

04:35

Thing, it's not always active. If you found this way to surprise it, you'd be fine. I think it's between me and showing for the plus two. If if aviary has a plus two so we can roll for it, we can arm wrestle for it. We want.

04:55

Um, Struggle was looking out cheating just though, wave them off and say you take it. Perfect. I will let the fragile birthday. I'm excited to live another day. Okay, so i'll take about this for you and then i guess i'll add your plus one on to the list to sell, or, yeah, because you need to change the wrap.

05:18

It around the monkey. Put it. Yeah, put it on. Um wayne will accept the cloak, he's not really cold, but he'll accepts cloak to look, he thinks it'll make him look dashing I'm sure way in i know you really want to get involved in this but this might be a fight you man.

05:41

You might want to sit out of who the fuck said. I wanted to get involved in this fight. I don't want to be anywhere near this site. Excellent here. Take this then just in case and uh, um grace and i'll hand him the the bag of holding that has all of our gluten such in it.

06:00

So that just in case grason gets killed, it is not on his body potentially lost. So you you hand this tiny sized monkey to work size backpack. I can't just sits there next to the backpack. That's the same size as him. Uh, i will do my best. He kind of just drags the backpack off with them.

06:27

Yeah, you want to hand with that way.

06:35

It's not heavy. It's just a little weird, i know. But this is fucking hilarious to watch. It can be funny then and he takes another pop off his spike. Give us, he keeps walking back to their whacking. I love about monkey. We're gonna die.

07:01

All right, let's go get the silver with.

07:07

Uh, as amiko heads out with you guys way in shelves at her, be fucking careful. Don't stand in front of it or behind it really avoid trying to stand next to a dragon. Uh, when wayne isn't in danger, he's like very mysterious and like East Asian mythical. But, like, when there's danger around, it gives me like, hardcore, yajiromo be vibes for Dragon Ball Z.

07:37

Thank you. God, drove me. So i was channeling. That's perfect. Most like recently, rewatched. All of uh, uh, dragon will be abrids. Oh my okay, we're not really, we're not derailing. We're fighting a dirty little. I feel the tran leaving tracks.

08:01

All right. Let's go. Oh god, where are we going to die? Okay. You're going north up until the high ice as soon. We get at least one night's rest before we get there. You do you do? Uh, it actually takes several days to make it up the mountains into where the dragon lives.

08:35

And when you're about a day out, your guide points up a sheer mountain clip. There's a crevice in there dragons and the entrance to the dragon's layers there.

09:06

Don't suppose you could give us like a schedule of one to expect the dragon come out of its lair.

09:21

I i do not know if dragons keep schedules, you know, that's fair, maybe it's not bored itinerary that's just pinned off ever. So, nicely there in the between the hours. No, no. I just stopped talking and it's like, i'm gonna fucking die.

09:46

So, you have a nice bit. Of course, actually show. Go can just ask um, oh no, he's doing it again. Yeah. What's up, man? If you're trying to call birds, there are no birds in miles of this place. Uh well there's the one brother. I don't think, i don't think.

10:06

Oh, she knows what i need to know. He's still knows. You're calling birds.

10:21

I mean, it's not like but it's not like the only way i could backfire on us is if it could, if someone else who could speak with animals here, is it and more of the chances but a dragon though, how to do that. Very good. Actually, i know more more than half the dragons community directly with animals.

10:44

I actually didn't know that part, uh,

10:51

I really gave him everything, didn't they?

10:57

They're scary when below them even and intelligent. Yes, very much. So evil intelligent intelligent and people like, you telling you, you can't lie to dragon.

11:22

So now far from the dragon's layer, you find a nice patch of forest.

11:29

Which has a fairly good sized clearing that you could battle a dragon in if you were trying to get it to come to the ground. But you find something else in this clearing as well, that might be some cause for concern.

11:54

Here and acquire.

12:09

No activate.

12:25

Another one of those stone monoliths, it looks like there's been footprints in the snow. Oh boy. Okay. Real quick. Before we start dying i have key points used on my sheet. Have we rested? I don't remember what our last comment. You have definitely rested since the last time you bought old man we arrested.

12:51

Okay, cool.

12:57

Throw up bone.

13:03

We're doing great.

13:19

Personal use perks can on himself.

13:55

And they don't seem to really notice you yet, but you see a gang of frost whites? Just sort of marching around in the snow. It's not there, but again. I am i on this page?

14:19

No, you are not.

14:27

They just walking around, huh?

14:33

Oh they're on the far side of the monolith from us. It looks like their patrolling around the monolith interdasting anyways yeah, yeah. Go check it out. Like mammoth or whatever. Again, the moment you say that, no, i just looks at your offended and then vanishes.

15:00

But uh yeah she will in fact that and you guys see, just in case it wasn't clear. We should all have our weapons at the ready. Yeah. And i was just gonna pull out a bow. A composite longbow.

15:22

Because you're always nice script up frost. I'm dead for our.

15:32

Okay, don't happen. He disappeared into the didn't. These things have like heat vision. Did i just send away to die?

15:47

Um, christian remembers and we'll get 10 arrows in that. Holy weapon, bomb that no way made. Our damage camera.

16:03

Coaching on take a few steps forward and just be in front of grace and and they go. But no, i don't think i think we established these ones. Don't have the vision but the big thing does. Nope, it was the front. The horror frost spirits to do. Uh, okay.

16:22

These are not they are not holy heck you can can have your your perception don't. Oh my gosh. Sucker those rolls, they're pretty good trying. Uh so one of you breathed too loudly. I guess, uh, because two of them got 30 plus, uh, and they all look in your direction, almost simultaneously not in.

17:02

No ways direction in your guys's direction. Perfect crawling. They cannot see invisibility.

17:16

And yes.

17:27

What in the french, fuck.

17:36

But he was not prepared for this and yet still no prepared than chocolate. Yeah, that's the one. It's all right though. The basement you're still going before one of the frostbites. Really funny this is going so well so far.

18:04

So we're going to spend six months in the polar north, as we have to wait one month. Every time we revive a party member to arrive, another party member just extends it for papaya. We just preserve the corpses by burying them in the snow. Uh, so the first white, the one who was most perceptive and the fastest uh let's loose.

18:35

The bone chilling rattle from its mouth. That kind of echoes and causes the snow. The swirl up. Oh, boys and ice coats over his body. Frost bark skin or some bullshit.

19:05

Just just ignore the fact that i thought he could do literally that it's just um, no way. I see that you were within melee reach of his path if you'd like.

19:24

Just clothesline. I should i really should. Hilarious thing is, i can't see you when you're invisible while i'm moving an enemy. So i can't met a game. That's pretty good, that's pretty good. Um you don't actually yeah, get one. Oh i'll take that hit. Um, some trigger being visible.

19:58

That's the one. Oh my back on track. The back contracts for the normal.

20:09

As this thing somehow managers to avoid an invisible attack but i hope. Yep, that happened. Yep, there you go. But he had some move, Grayson.

20:28

Uh, grace is going to shoot up the one. He's got targeted in the back. Um and let the melee folks deal. The one that ran up. Oh yeah, she's a paladin with the flaming sword. She'll be fighting against the frost white. Yep, but he is gonna save key points for the then this should have the holy weapon damage edited

21:09

24, not going to attack rules. It is um, about an arranging from it out for me.

21:31

Uh, yeah. So the first day all hits and he turns and looks at your group,

21:42

He does because it's his turn. Next, anything else on your return, sir?

21:50

Uh, took a five foot step and i'll be it.

21:57

The frostbite that you hit also rages.

22:03

Also, what's rages? Oh, i thought i said something scary for a second.

22:14

The undead race. Ah it's not it's not a barbarian rage or no. Well, i like the mental image, i mean, it's kind of a Bavarian range but not It's the obelisk.

22:42

They're kind of fast. Welcome. No way they are kind of, yep.

22:56

Moves up the swing.

23:07

I'm gonna.

23:13

This is when you tell me the cup.

23:24

Uh they can be stuck attack, it just doesn't bleed. Oh yeah. No, as a slip direction.

23:36

Reflecting a little bit new invisibility feature. It's so good. The boom. Oh yeah.

23:54

Got hit the rest button for her.

24:02

Blended cathy care. Critical wounds. Fuck them up car.

24:18

But you undead will get to make a will save, of course. Okay, that's cool.

24:40

Cry. Deeply. We're gonna cry, deeply.

24:47

Um, What do i got like, 50 feet of movement? I believe we do. Yes. So we're going to move up near up near mako and then we're going to shoot one of these guys and see how that goes for us. Getting ready for the dergen.

25:20

I'm out of ammunition. No, i'm not. I just hit the wrong button.

25:32

And 18 will unfortunately myth of course it will hell yeah.

25:43

That's my turn.

25:50

Well, she's gonna snap the bow in half over his leg and throw again.

26:10

She'll go.

26:27

Yeah, it's by encourage. Hello, everyone. Throw it on.

26:38

Everybody get on the on the train.

26:50

And turn.

27:00

Range.

27:22

Okay, they're not that smart. Um, echo, uh she is fucking so i will turn that on.

28:03

My evil.

28:16

A role in her position damage.

28:40

Which later? Okay. So, first and then 14,

28:59

And she cuts quite a flaming gas out of the way.

29:08

Then full attacks her.

29:14

Wow, toward

29:19

Shield flam.

29:24

It's a makeup only have one attack.

29:33

No, actually, she could have made a full attack there and i didn't roll her full attack that. I, there we go. Okay, well, it's still the second one. Um, never mind. She killed that white before he could do anything to her. Figurason, i forgot about that.

30:03

Okay, i'm already had a second attack by now christen. Um, the he will target the one. That's right. In front of coya, that i've got selected.

30:24

Man, you good?

30:29

Your second arrow. Finished him. And i imagine the third goes to the one next to him. Yeah, i don't know if it hits a month, it does exactly.

30:44

Confirm anything. I'm playing turn. All right. Some of the five feet but that's it. So prof away. No, a

31:13

All attack action.

31:19

I can't i stop that sounds like a really? Yeah, what and? All right, how can i just tend

31:37

It hits a lot.

31:53

Looks like second attack. So,

32:07

Bye, bye.

32:15

Let me.

32:23

All his natural armor, he's gone.

32:32

Very good and she's miserable. Yeah. Nope, already anything. I'm planning what? That was my my full thing. Why do i have the ability to see? No, a right now. Where did we do that? On the token, do you still have seen invisibility on on your senses? It didn't work like the first time she vanishing tricked but now i can see over some reason so i don't remember how to do that scantry about it.

33:01

I wouldn't worry about it because yeah, you know what? I'm not. I will try not to meta game with that knowledge. You can see her footprints in the snow. Haven't moved. Oh, she has a ten intelligence.

33:20

Which means of average intelligence for a bird.

33:30

As evidenced by the fact that three times this show was cast commune with birds. Oh, she's been like what's up, dude? What's up, dude? We need.

33:46

Critical.

33:53

My goodness. These are some strong-willed. White, welcome to Twitter, we get to minkai and he uses the community with birds and a village with lots and lots of. Okay, you just block over. We are? We heard you wanted to have a chat. You got anything shiny on you, it's his version of gather information, okay?

34:21

Oh she's oh, she's gonna drop his bow in the snow. And draw out is stabbers as a move action, and then he's going to do a stab on the guy in front of him, if it's still alive or standing rather.

34:39

He is still on bike painting.

34:56

That is a hit. And then i'm very dumb and then i will take a five foot step right there. And your blinking. Yeah.

35:14

Could have had it all this time.

35:23

Doesn't look like it.

35:32

And it's gonna be there for you. That will do it. Boom. Boom.

35:49

The target clean the sword. Swing the shield.

36:02

I think the 20 hits but the shield slam should hit.

36:19

I'm so sorry. I was looking at the invisibility thing. Um yeah, sword misses shield. Slam hits

36:33

Proposed out his wayblade 15, 2025 this white game. And swings on together. Quite, it doesn't have a melee but now yet. But oh, she doesn't, oh, all. She's done is cast spells before. Oh,

37:01

So that'll be two less. Sorry, i forgot to take like that is still hit.

37:12

You know bone shaker started in it anymore. Uh no it's agile now. Oh yeah, i see and enter.

37:25

This frost white, it's actually gonna attack coyote with his slam.

37:41

Which means? Oh yeah. Get energy. Drained.

37:59

She'll clams. Misses,

38:11

Like one.

38:20

Top of the round. Amigo tries to step into playing with you realize. There's no way he's there.

38:29

Gives her a quick pat on the back before stepping forward. And said not the shed. No other way. Home unfortunately. Oh no. Wait, that critical confirmation is a 21. They don't have that built-in yet. I and she incinerates, another one of the undeads with her truck and inquiry sword.

38:56

Oh, she didn't smite. That one like confirmation denims land, actually. 38 feedback which means you only had one hp level. Never mind. He's filled it.

39:16

Congratulations, guys, i don't think the frozen dead are much more of a threat to you anymore. This guy dead. Oh shit. No, he's not back. End combat. We kill him. It's you you kill him. He's he's only got 25 inch feet left. Quiet punches them in the face. I need disintegrates

39:45

Well, loser there seems to be a lot of undead around here. As anyone hurt. I'm the little spicy koya is also a little spicy.

40:10

All right. I'll sidetrack for a second while we're healing. I was looking at magic items and found something called a tengo drinking jug where you can eat tengo jesus. Anybody heard of it? Oh no. Yes, yes, yeah. You can it'll purify any water. You put into it and then you can turn it into the plum liqueur.

40:28

We talked about sake or tea and OG is for sure. Going to get him the tiny belt gourd of never-ending tea and alcohol.

40:42

Just a constant supply of hot tea.

40:49

Especially if i'm gonna channel more. There are ones that we had. I already hit the button. It's too late. That's okay. I'm just going to give her those back and take a couple charges off her wander care. Moderate sounds good. Um, so we're gonna walk up to this black stick.

41:15

Uh, obsidian obelisk.

41:22

What do you guys making this thing?

41:28

This is the exactly the instructions under the percent from the last one they are. And these undead all bear the same strange. Three clubs mark.

41:50

I guess we just give it a more.

41:57

See if we, if there's any treasure here. Oh, there's treasure on the white.

42:16

So you guys encountered one of these before, i don't remember doing that. I think it was when i was gone.

42:24

You weren't here for the the yogi owner fight.

42:30

All right. Yeah, we came across uh, one, the south of waves, that's where we got that. Um, kimono you're wearing, right? And so there's a symbol on them. That's also on these whites. It wasn't on the obelisk. It was in the, the old man's layer that you found that symbol.

42:59

Is it doing any kind of magic?

43:05

The symbol the obelisk. Uh, i can't know that i'm asking everybody. Yes.

43:24

No way. Use your magic skills and detect this thing. It's only magic skills. I've got stabbing people, i'm stopping part ever. So, you're a bit out of luck there.

43:48

That's pretty fancy stuff.

44:00

It does feel vaguely magical but more like it's for a purpose than is magic itself.

44:13

Many ancient civilizations used to raise things like this to create places of power. There are many places like this university.

44:28

Oh, you mean like the Irish fun? Something like that. Yes, i don't think we're in varicia anymore. Previous year is not the sole keepers of ancient civilizations and techniques. I just wanted to do a wizard of Oz reference. I just wanted to make the kids joke. Didn't, uh, did the villagers say something about their being a lot of obelisk as you get closer to the the the north i do.

45:06

Remember them saying that? Yes.

45:25

Did you check the last one's vibe. Did you touch it or anything last time?

45:35

As i recall, we found out with the last one that these made look old.

45:46

And they're spontaneously would work. So,

45:54

Quite suspect a super socio there, they're super sauce. Ah, thank you. I cannot offer conversation right now. I'm sorry, guys. Fading. I, i have enough energy in me to stand here and be a inspire courage machine. Like bang that drum i seriously speaking though, i think we just figured out that like there's not realistically much we can do unless we not to you know, how to get rid of a whole load of rock.

46:41

No, okay. Oh gee, walks wide around it and we keep going question, mark.

46:55

I mean, aside from the monolith, this is the perfect place to fight the white dragon. I was about. So well, if you wanted to bring it out into the open, she indicates in the general difficult.

47:12

Make myself comfortable in a tree while you do that.

47:19

Didn't you get this shards of the eggshell? Choco. Yeah, i did actually i didn't mean something. I was smoking. Just pull him out and why i'm on fire.

47:37

You make that suggestion. No, i blink some and just begins walking off and climbs a tree ever. Seen dragon's like. Of course, i can, sort of guess what? One looks like. Considering i have the fragments of one, so like description in case i'm missing anything on missing here.

48:04

White dragon eggs are covered with a bunch of small, white and silver tinged scales. Think like an ostrich egg just scale. Yeah.

48:20

Choco will hold his hand out and uh, cast a silent image and reconstruct the dragon egg in his hand. Unless and i won't hold up to close your inspection but it might get her attention. She seeds a bunch of randos in this clearing. One of them holding, what looks like her egg?

48:44

Do you have to maintain that? Or can we like play catch with it? Play a game of soccer.

48:54

Uh, cannot extend beyond four plus one per levels and foot cubes and i can move it within that size. So yeah, we could throw it back and forth. Here's what we do. Oh, she's gonna start building a snowman. So he gets the big base one and then he makes a middle one.

49:13

And then he puts the dragon in egg on top, and then he starts doing target practice at the fake dragon egg, with his new bow,

49:26

So,

49:31

I like your guys's idea for literally any other enemy than a dragon. Okay.

49:44

I, i know they have blindsight, but surely, they don't have blind sight or infinity, isn't it? Like blindsight 60 feet or something. 120 minimum, of course this that's fine. Even if like they just it can just assume that we're stupid as long as it knows that we're being disrespectful, that's a fair point.

50:14

The being disrespectful part. That'll really rile a dragon. It's like, it's like riding like vulgar stuff on. Somebody's car window for them to see it like from the inside but you do it like backwards like you're dumb, but it's still rude, you know.

50:34

And then it's not a matter of their blind sense. She knows all of her eggs were destroyed.

50:42

Okay, dragons are very smart.

50:52

Go go. Stand buy, amigo. And both of you back up, please. I can't say i want to be in a pitched middle. I'll be over here. Oh, she's shaking the whole time. He's doing this by the way, a maker does not leave.

51:24

Boom. Boom. All right. How long can you maintain that illusion? It's concentration. So, so yes.

51:46

As far as i can tell, i can keep it up indefinitely. As long as i'm concentrating on it.

52:13

All right. Uh, well, it is actually several hours before the dragon gets back into this area of the world again.

52:34

All right. Uh, we shoka will point out where on his person, the music box is in case he goes down before. He's able to activate it. Sweet mother of god.

52:54

I think she might see us. She saw us from minkai. Oh, i heard the natural bunny graphic go off. Yep, there we go. Yes, tree just just like leans out of the trailer look sadness. Like what?

53:25

I hate that. Hold on barking at something. There's no.

53:40

Oh my gosh, that was crazy.

54:00

I think maybe there's something wrong with me.

54:33

Isn't it crazy?

55:06

My dad actually took me out because i think that was something we had talked about last or last week before in her against cold damage. Yeah, we'll say she did it when she hears the dragon's roar and then runs off to stand by. No way. I think it's twent resist 20, that's her level.

55:42

Throughout the footage. Uh and as the dragon hopefully is coming closer. Grayson has a potion in his hand. Ready to drink it.

56:14

Yes, it is. Uh, no actually resist energy is not what she casts on you. That's the second level spell. Slot per each of you communal. Resist. Energy is a third.

56:33

Yes, that's when she gets between everyone was standing group together because she's got to touch you. Yeah. Um, but yes, 20 points resistance and, uh, isn't the duration divided on communal? It is here. Okay? And so, 10 minutes duration basically, one, two, three, four, five, six. If this fight lasts, someone's got 20.

57:07

I want doing well, that is fair.

57:16

But here's here's the thing about dragons.

57:31

Whether?

57:40

With my mist, is it talking about caster level when it says seventh level. It goes up to 20, okay?

58:16

Huh. That's uh a graphic. Is the thing about dragons that they are spellcasters. Yes, that is the thing about dragons is that they are still casters. There it is.

58:48

Oh, hell yeah, right. So in fogs and then it shows up and murders. It's all coming back to me now. The exact way of thought that was described to you.

59:14

Tengo were basically the goldfish of the air. Okay. It's very

59:24

So like the moment he can choco is getting the music box out.

59:47

All right.

01:00:19

I will roll in Michigan but i won't be happy about it. That is perfect. Yes, i use my amazing initiative to pull out my deck. Chair on this. Branch got a little hammock chair. Pretty much and also is just irreferably pissed that like you're not even gonna love me.

01:00:46

Watch the show fucking inconsider attacking.

01:00:53

Uh, there is there is legitimately very looking like i can do

01:01:12

I mean, to be perfect. You cotton's in fact now, never mind, i'm gonna be quiet.

01:01:24

The same p. Just this book just really absolutely expected us to buy phone cutting glasses.

01:01:35

Just uh, so did not mean to delete you. Grayson. I have my apologize. Um, this that's the dragon strap. Yeah. Um, this is like fog, right? That we're having right now. Yes. Is it like a snowman than the dragon can sneeze see through? It is. Oh cool. That's great.

01:01:57

That's fantastic. The only thing it actually needs to kill us is its full attack action. All this other shit is just to make you cry.

01:02:21

All right. Just roll the d6 and tell us which character you're deleting. Well, none, she still has to move.

01:02:42

Making sure the vision thing is, right. Global elimination is on perfect.

01:02:58

Yeah, i don't remember this thing in the description of what how she fought. This is absolutely exactly what we were told. It's just, i do not remember summons. It was like summons giant fog, cloud flies down kills somebody. And if it runs into any trouble whatsoever where people try and fight back, it also burrows underground.

01:03:21

See, you can't even a jacket.

01:03:29

I guess i just completely would forgot the thought part me too. As soon as the fog came up, i went, why did i even buy a bow? Why did i buy a boat? All right. So one, two, three, four view. And it's immediate range.

01:03:50

Luckily for you, she is actually unaware of your enchantments right now.

01:04:18

Do you even get a reflex save if you're not aware of the attack? Yes. You, you are definitely aware but this is that is coming. But what? Sorry, i just laugh, but

01:04:39

Is this real life? That's my only good save same here. That's my only good save with the actual fuck.

01:04:54

But grace in. Oh just remember to reduce that damage by 20. Yes. Um could grace, did a person? See if he can determine the direction towards the dragon. Yes, you have a scary high perception.

01:05:18

The dragon is.

01:05:23

You can tell by the beating of its wings and the exhalation of the breath that it just took that the dragon is where Measure tool. Wait, if we're all gathering this direction. Okay, if we're all gathered up for coyote to hit us with the session, we have all been gotten by that.

01:05:51

It's got a 10 minute duration, she cast it and then we all moved towards spaces. Yep.

01:06:00

Um, so he will drink the potion of divine favor, but he has his hand and then, well, which is a move action, right? In. Uh and then he will fire. Oh gosh. I didn't think i was gonna need to use one of these.

01:06:25

I don't know if this is actually going to help in this situation. But uh i can hey like post the item for everyone to see.

01:06:38

Uh, he has three seeking arrows, he's gonna fire one of them in that direction.

01:06:59

Also, do we still have inspire courage? Uh, not yet. I do need you to target a square for me though. He targets gosh. I think this was about where you would pointed.

01:07:30

That does unfortunately miss and he'll take a five foot step and that's sister.

01:07:43

Shoko. We'll take a five foot step diagonally and take out the music box and play it.

01:08:10

Okay.

01:08:17

The step is a good idea. There's the tag for seeking, by the way.

01:08:47

You guys here a majestic roar and then you feel something, very heavy settle in the snow next to you.

01:09:09

I don't know why you can't see him from there. You can see each other. Hope you can see in this big guy. It should go says let's see gutters from the frost that is covering his body. Oh, can you see him now? Uh, i saw them for a second there but they need disappeared again.

01:09:43

And yes, yes, he can.

01:10:02

No. Um okay. So that was my turn and then shooka would like to say out loud in viridian. Uh hoya hit grayson with that thing. The the thing you you the spell you used against the chimera

01:10:31

Yeah, i have that ready. I have one of that. Ready. I can't find him without casting it.

01:10:45

Grayson come to the sound of my voice. Well, i thought well uh and then shuffle and his turn.

01:11:01

Actually moves a standard action to play the music box. It was. Yes, it is a full activation item. What eat?

01:11:24

Let me go healed all the damage. The dragon just did.

01:11:35

Upon.

01:11:44

Blast it all.

01:11:52

Uh, can grace and call out to coya. Like just during so how many miles away is the silver dragon? How many turns? Oh, no silver dragons. The teleported to us.

01:12:11

I mean if coyote asks, Grayson to to call out he would but otherwise he wouldn't have said anything that was quite calling out to you, to come to the sound of a voice. She is calling you.

01:12:31

Grayson says to dr. Uh, yeah, i'll be there as soon as i can.

01:12:40

So cleans holding her action to cast action path on you. Oh gee. Um, can he determine the direction that the dragon is in? Be it based on the breath attack. And the feeling of the gigantic roar and the weight in the snow like 20 feet in front of him.

01:13:00

Uh yes with a perception check.

01:13:14

Yeah, you've got it. It's south and maybe east, okay? He's going to move some spaces, i'm gonna go like 20 feet. Like right there. Okay, so you feel a claw reaching out of the fog.

01:13:44

Oh hell yeah you can just roll the damage one. I don't have to roll the attack rule. I actually have to roll multiple attack rolls. Pardon.

01:14:03

So that's it's bite. Don't apply the damage yet.

01:14:15

Um, you are in range.

01:14:23

Primary attack. I you see the mouth of the white dragon open up from the mists as it comes down to bite you and have and then a massive, shining silver club. That's it. Space away from you. Oh, that's cool.

01:14:51

Do not be. So, hasty little one, an OG makes a cloaca sickle

01:15:02

It's still your turn. All you've done is move. Um, so which one am i seeing? I'm seeing the white one right in front of me. That's the only one. I have vision of right now. Is the white dragon? Yep. Okay. Then i think i will use some key points to make more of cheese.

01:15:28

Think that's what we're going to do. Remember, we discussed that he could just close his eyes environmental support. Oh, that's true. Oh god. Okay, he's gonna stab the dragon astrology. We decided on for you if you remember was just for you to get in space in the total defense section.

01:15:49

Yeah, we're gonna drop the bow, pull out the weapons. As we move up to you realize he's not gonna be able to use the bow at all. He's gonna do a stab and he's going to turn on defensive stance. As he does stab and i can no longer see the dragon.

01:16:12

You so it's like go ahead.

01:16:27

I'll think that's going to do it. No. Your blade bounces off of the ice hard scales of its body. Perfect. And then oh she will stand there and die.

01:16:46

Very well, no way.

01:16:55

There's rye.

01:17:00

Yeah, it's barely. Hey. Oh, how are you doing fucking work?

01:17:15

We're in a bit of a pickle turns out. Dragons can cast spells, nope. That bad, huh? Uh, well, if you can see the screen right now. Can you see the screen plugging in? Right now you're here in time for OT's. Death. Cutscene.

01:17:43

Um, the dragon has covered the entire battlefield fog and it can see through it just fine. Uh, we can't see shit.

01:18:00

Uh struggle managed to some of the silver dragon. Uh, and we're kind of just putting our hopes on him right now.

01:18:13

And maybe Grayson depends on how well the other plan works.

01:18:28

I see a very, very dark map.

01:18:36

A very, very dark map that is. Uh, yep.

01:18:54

Number one initiative zeal. Well, lovely.

01:19:15

Why i have to roll so good.

01:19:23

It, let's make sense. So,

01:19:29

Okay.

01:19:37

Okay. Uh theo go. And take your turn since we just got supper around, okay?

01:20:07

I have no idea what i'm going to be doing the situation.

01:20:17

Oh, what's zero? No. The general direction of the durghan. He can also roll perception. Oh, goodie.

01:20:42

Oh,

01:20:47

Elf forgot. Uh, i need wheel saves from

01:20:58

Uh, OT choco not i might go and grayson

01:21:10

All right, man.

01:21:20

Oh shit, it's 180 feet. And this one, the bm realizes the line of soap for christmas. You do need bread, plentify for it. So, i only need it from ochi button. Oh oh, that's perfect. Fantastic. Uh hold on. Let me just look at okay. Gets to be scared and alone.

01:21:50

Come on ochi. You're an honorable samurai look deep within yourself. Yeah, i'm gonna immediate action and spend a resolve to roll twice for this.

01:22:08

It's a good thing that i did.

01:22:16

That's much better. Okay, let me go make the mark the point off.

01:22:22

Okay, flower safety against his breath weapon. So, i hope it stays against the fear.

01:22:33

Of the 23. Does think, yes. So, you are immune towards vertical presence for 24 hours.

01:22:47

It's rightful presence.

01:22:53

He's Santa sorry, zeal. No problem. Well, i've been go ahead and myself. It might come in handy.

01:23:08

Hi my cat here. Wasn't.

01:23:16

Oh and then of course, did i get a dental idea? Where where this thing is at. Got roll. No, i did roll 25 you heard. It's roar in this general direction.

01:23:40

Did you see the ping? Yeah, i've seen the thing.

01:23:47

But i have no idea where the rest of the party is at. I'm at the moment. That's true. So i'll start moving blindly somewhere.

01:24:05

And then end this turn. No way.

01:24:13

If you were up in the tree, my understanding that continues forward,

01:24:28

Crack on from

01:24:48

Cold damage instead of acid.

01:25:01

Let me put right here.

01:25:33

And follow my ice stuff.

01:25:43

Break it.

01:26:00

All right, so first up

01:26:06

One is this?

01:26:12

What the fuck is that in effect notes?

01:26:20

All right. Okay, you take five points to damage from the sheer cold. Or a radiating from this dragon resist energy. That is fair. Yes, no.

01:26:41

Uh,

01:26:47

Something to do. This would be so incredibly vicious if we didn't have the silver dragon to, oh, thank god if we didn't have the silver. Dragon. Wait, you can't buy skill. Checks, can you you can't. No course you but you broke up there. Yeah, your mic is having problems.

01:27:14

Oh for fox. Say it just kind of cuts in and out while you're talking amazing. I imagine it's blue thing. I'll fix it in a second. Um, no, you can't watch it but you can fail to hit the dc. That is fair. I actually rolled the wrong skill anyways.

01:27:32

Since she didn't see it cast, she just saw its effects. Uh, you're it's going fine now. Maybe it's just like a push to talk thing. Oh no, my microphone was literally halfway across my desk. Oh, it was just a suppression.

01:27:56

The dragon mutters something in draconic about. Filthy humans and two layers. Murderers. Two leggers with the hard r. Wow, what?

01:28:20

And fails the cast defensively.

01:28:27

So that's nice.

01:28:32

And then that entirely steps back away from mochi.

01:28:42

Do not fear friends. Give me a moment and hold on to something. Um, she'll go amigo. And ochi all get the very pleasant sensation of a huge. Dragon's wings beating very hard over them.

01:29:03

Hell yeah.

01:29:09

And as it starts to disperse away from you,

01:29:18

Start to get a little more vision.

01:29:29

Oh man, she's default. Um, sort of

01:29:47

I have to do this so much, you guys can see.

01:30:00

I probably said before, i did it.

01:30:07

Is this a was this a spell that was cast?

01:30:15

You're gonna have to be more specific, like the fog that's around us. It is. Oh good.

01:30:30

It's gonna take the two rounds to do it. God damn it. I think the silver dragon's trying to take care of.

01:31:02

But i see the monolith again is back.

01:31:08

Just a bit. You shouldn't be able to see that at all. Wow, it's gonna say i don't see that.

01:31:17

I'll be right back from grabbing a refill. I'm sorry.

01:32:03

Why is your dark vision? Letting you see through it. Oh no.

01:32:17

We've been broken, i guess.

01:32:30

I don't know if any of you guys. This is a little off topical, save foreign, no right. No, i can only see i've been around me. I can't paint any of the other tuggins.

01:32:47

As it should be christen your turn.

01:32:54

Um, okay. Christian's gonna start. It's moving towards koias voice.

01:33:08

Letting me drag my character.

01:33:14

Are you on the select?

01:33:28

On the, the side panel up here, are you on select tokens or select targets? Give me anything. This is that it's currently not my turn. Use your turn though. Oh right. Cuz i accidentally deleted your token. Let me do add this one to the comment. Whoops update, 19.

01:34:01

There you go.

01:34:10

Racing wants to delay is turned until aftershoko. He can do everything he does with inspired courage. He has to double move to get to her buddy ends up right next to cocoa. That's okay.

01:34:30

Was ready to cast the spell on you when you appeared. All right. That is the i still have some feet movement, lower.

01:34:46

He'll keep moving pasture saying. Uh, thanks for that. I'll make it worth it, and he keeps running and we'll industry there.

01:35:02

Remember correctly, part. Two of the plan was to get zero to cast rely on you next. Uh, it's for our courage.

01:35:28

And,

01:35:32

And we'll start making a bit here. I know assume the dragon also gets it. Yes.

01:35:47

And if you big girl right there, huh?

01:35:56

Now that i can see the dragon, do i have to do the will save for presents?

01:36:03

Um, that's a valid point but no not yet, okay?

01:36:15

So i just realized i have to take back above la contain able to cast because i want to be had a prepared for the day.

01:36:28

How did you click on it, then what? Because it was still prepared from the day before the last time we had game and i never got around to changing themselves to the new day.

01:36:46

I may go.

01:36:52

Uh, my fuel.

01:37:03

Charges.

01:37:17

And it's new turn.

01:37:24

Thank you, bite.

01:37:29

Oh shit. Let me goes actually out of his range.

01:37:44

Or charging.

01:38:04

Uh, the dragon releases a roar as the flaming katana. Actually, that's quite deeply into it.

01:38:18

Koi has turn.

01:38:26

She claims down out of the tree.

01:38:36

Forget how much movement she has.

01:38:44

Oh, gee

01:38:49

Lady amigo, you shouldn't remain so close to him. He's gonna say to her and then try and move around. Let's see. I should have measured this beforehand. I'm sorry.

01:39:18

Now we'll just go the shorter route and then roll, acrobatics question mark. Oh yes, you're welcome to right here is where the attack of opportunity comes. Oh, i'm sorry. I'll have to be much closer than that. To do acrobatics because my speed will be half. So basically the whole way, so it'd be much more like you get the idea.

01:39:47

I think i have the movement to get to the other side of them though. Uh, with the route you took. That's what i'm saying i realized after i said that that, like, i'd have to go much closer, but if i'm rolling acrobatics, anyways, i should just go close. That's the square where the attack triggers is also important.

01:40:08

Yeah, i should not. I don't think i'm gonna make it anyways with a 19. It does not make it. Uh, so if this is the square, you are still in his reach when he trigger the attack. So, let's just say it's like, right here, right here because i have to go much closer to make it with acrobatics.

01:40:33

Uh, because it's half speed.

01:40:40

Does he stop me or do i just provoke the attack and then continue movement. You, you provoke the attack unless you're going through his square and then you stop, no. If you're going around him, you get to continue your movement. You fail your acrobatic check, you don't get through and I mean space.

01:40:57

So, it would be somewhere over here, that i would provoke it. Because i'd have to go much closer to him to be able to get that far with acrobatics.

01:41:13

Okay, so you are trying to pass through his face. Do i have to? That was. What is your movements being 50? It's 50.

01:41:35

I can't make it regardless. So yeah, i have to try and move through his space and i get so excited. 20 feet 25. Only gets me to like the corner. 25, 30. So you would need 35 60 movement to make it all the way there. Yeah, i have to be at the corner, even if i, if i did it that way.

01:41:58

So but he stops me, you know, only if you pass through his square, whatever like if you tried tumbling straight through a square, he'd get a plus 5 to a cmd and your movement would stop here will end up right there. Will take the hit.

01:42:17

But your positioning is important for another reason. All right, so if you're there when you take the address opportunity, he can in fact try to protect you.

01:42:31

You got to be within his reach. No, boom. Not that. I think the dragon hits you. Anyways, that's a mess. That was a three. Hell yeah. All right, you've moved. Oh, by the way, there's OT have made armor on himself. No, he wouldn't let me drama. He doesn't benefit from it as he has braces of rumor.

01:43:01

Oh, we done. That's true. Um, and i don't get flanking, this isn't qualified as flanking, right?

01:43:13

Times going for this square.

01:43:18

It's not. I mean, it does draw a line through its square, which, which things, right? So we're making the left side, top corner and a bottom right side corner. Uh, yeah, because you've got corner corner. So, this corner points.

01:43:48

So yes, rad. Okay. We're going to take a swing. Um, i do not have a swift action, or i would challenge because i use my immediate action to, uh, do my double role for the fear. So, sad day.

01:44:23

Because i confirm it does confirm. Not that i can. Yeah, he doesn't have the function is done.

01:44:41

What?

01:44:46

For when you attack, he didn't even have the flanking bonus. Sign up. He is flanking. Oh, that's true. I didn't put that interested but you hit end crit and took a chunk out of the dragon. Now i can die with honor. That's how she's turn. Very nice.

01:45:08

Zero.

01:45:14

So it was even going to stand there like and you know kind of you know pull out a spell book. Look through it for a moment. And then. Well wait. Yes, i have that. And then he'll he'll wait for for grace and to get over there.

01:45:44

Don't you mean you hold an action to castle spell on him? Yeah. Yeah. You can also just delay your turn. Yeah.

01:45:55

Yeah, i'm going to cast a spell when gracing gets over here. It's going to be fly.

01:46:05

You need specific conditions for that, i believe. So, you like waiting for visibility of Grayson or

01:46:16

Well, it's once we think it's a it's within range. Okay, no way. See that?

01:46:33

We are going to, he's stupid.

01:46:41

It's actually creases my movements with 20 and what is my current speed 70 or something.

01:46:49

Should have base plus 10 for coya. And then plus 20 for the point. Yeah. So, uh, making a purposeful fall and then softening. The blending simple, acrobatics rule that you can do in your sleep. Yeah, succeed up. So no, i just steps off, follows the 20 people lens gracefully and just yeets halfway accept.

01:47:24

Hey buddy, this squares problematic. Is it now?

01:47:36

If you you can move to here without provoking, if you move to here with that movement provoke, fine, close enough, whatever gets me that i did. That's like a double milk.

01:47:56

I'm good if i die here, i'm blaming you on it.

01:48:12

Well, this is fun. There are enough people in range.

01:48:23

Spread out the full attacks.

01:48:28

Uh so the sliding paladin, we'll be getting a bike clock uh no way. And oh, gee, we'll both each be getting a wing. And then OJ since you stabbed it in its kidney, and brought part of it out with you, you're getting tail flap. That's fair.

01:49:07

And,

01:49:12

You can't vital struggle with full attack, right? Absolutely, what? No. Okay. I thought so god. Now, regular bite.

01:49:28

And hit. Let's look.

01:49:45

I applied damage twice. Lady. You may goes dead. What did i just say?

01:50:03

Oh, makeo does go down actually but she's not dead.

01:50:11

What i'm doing?

01:50:20

Now know, it feels vindicated owing for you. Yep. Attached a wing for you.

01:50:39

And then a tail slap that box. Yo, what a day about? Boom. Silver. Dragon these storm the windstorm that it is. Kicked up blows the fog. Completely away is now a full round as fast. And now grayson is going to delete the white dragon. Well, no, i have to use a turn to run to get fly.

01:51:11

Apparently, no. Here in written was once you're in range? Why is the touch bell? Oh yeah. Dragon steps forward. Oh, am i able to see things now?

01:51:37

No thinking.

01:51:41

Anything.

01:51:49

Hey, is everyone this vision on? Nope it's not. I have the small circle still.

01:52:07

How about now? Good forest the whole time. Because when we originally got here, i had all gray squares and the obelisk floating in space. Yes, we've been in this forest the whole time. This this is the first time i've seen this forest, when no way it was. Like, i climb a tree.

01:52:24

I was like, oh, no way. Just gets to invent a tree to climb with, man. If i could just invent trees, my life would be much easier. Now, i am multi-classed into druid. Yo, you do not love me. Multi-classmen to be good. You're having a peaceful day. And then whoops, you suddenly exploded into a tree.

01:52:45

This makes a lot more sense for like a spot to pick to fight. I imagine we were just in, like, a completely flat open tundra. I was like, we're gonna fucking die, bro. And we might still fucking die.

01:53:03

That slowly fair. That is a very real possibility. Now, i think about where the fuck is amiko. She's dead. Not for long. I gotta move him so i can target her, but he is standing over her almost guarding her and leans over and breathes down. Breathe golden mist out on her.

01:53:52

Christen.

01:53:58

Uh, it wants to delete this thing. Go for it. Grayson. Well, i don't want you to lose your spell slug. So personal move to next to you.

01:54:15

And then we'll fire the white dragon. A single shot. Um,

01:54:28

22 will bounce off of its scales. Unfortunately, all right and that's his turn.

01:54:40

Zero is to get a fly.

01:54:47

Okay, anything else on your turn?

01:54:55

No, he'll say there and she'll go.

01:55:08

Wait, we haven't started curves. Go. Don't we? Yeah, we still stars. Yes, i encourage them. Huh? Okay.

01:55:20

Um,

01:55:30

Truck will get out here and try to catch the white dragon's eye and say um hey how do you think? I know knew what your egg looked like and uh shall go will empty the bag with the eggshell out in front of them.

01:56:03

Football looking at the white dragon in the eye.

01:56:09

Roll a bluff for me.

01:56:15

There's one thing that white dragons are not good at.

01:56:24

It's their plus four defense motive.

01:56:32

All right, so the dragon releases a roar as it focuses his entire attention on you. The silver dragon looks over. Looks absolutely shocked and appalled you fool.

01:56:55

Anything else on your turn?

01:57:04

I guess i'll take total defense if that didn't count as my standard action.

01:57:11

Let that be a move action, all right?

01:57:19

Uh yeah. Held on defense. All right, that'll be my turn. Uh, may go. Yeah, i'm like goes on the ground. Unconscious the show goers. He is not unconscious actually. Oh, dragon healer.

01:57:44

He switch action. Lays on hands herself. It targeting the dragon apparently? Well, it's hard to change tokens while wins on top of the other uh and stands up.

01:58:17

Of that yet. But she does have this. Apparently not set up.

01:58:40

Um, okay. So 48.

01:58:53

Oh, 10 points of damage, but did not closely blend it.

01:59:03

Oh, gee

01:59:08

Oh, gee seeing him do a lot of stab and rip and chomp on a mako is going to go full blender. Um, let's see here.

01:59:26

We're going to use.

01:59:31

We're going to use some key points here.

01:59:36

We're going to use a lot of key points here.

01:59:41

I'm going to start bleeding a lot, like all over the place and then he's gonna stab this thing. Like a lot of times. Let's see the copy ninja. Um, You technically still a blinking from the dragon. Do i? Okay, the corner. We'll count it.

02:00:21

Your first attack. It's

02:00:33

All about number three, offhand. Number one.

02:00:41

Maintenance, iterative.

02:00:46

Off hand iterative. Oh, i shouldn't have that yet. You're right. Oh my gosh. You do it. It was about. I said you have greater number. No, that's not till like next level. Sorry i just hit the full attack button so that offhand iterative doesn't exist. But the main hand or the offhand, first one does and your minus 2.

02:01:22

The 23 barely hits.

02:01:35

Blue. Anything else there? Oh, i'm sorry. And the one more key point for one more attack you already used yourself. What was my swift? Is it a swift action? Yeah, exactly. Okay. That's why then we're good. God. It was free. No way. Yeah. Okay, so nobody takes a step.

02:02:11

And we we are going to attempt to show oh gee how to actually blend with some and fail miserably because that's what we do here. Um, sir, first attack blinking, we're not going to power attack because we're just going to try and take off as many scales as we can.

02:02:31

I didn't put the two in there again by the way. So, that would have been, it would have been really good on the 23.

02:02:44

Does that have your planking in it now, i think. No, no, it's not in that. Well it's the plus two undefined, that's probably it. So, that's a mess. The first one is a miss. It's okay. We'll just continue.

02:03:08

That's a hit this thing. Can bleed. Yep. So it's easy just by four. It's now second. Oh, second.

02:03:36

You could applying your stuff. Yep. Okay cool. Swift action.

02:03:45

Well, you you go. You got the second darn it like that's that's good. I reduced it says you by by four it has been native from the one. It's a third landed.

02:04:00

Well, it can bleed out.

02:04:07

I it probably can because you know what white dragons don't have the silvers do. Healing magic.

02:04:22

Um, i'm trying to smog but ochi amigo and uh, eyes on all get attacks opportunity as it charges at shoco.

02:04:40

That i hear. Well, i guess he did.

02:04:50

Just linking and sneak attack. Still apply. Yes, they do.

02:05:12

All right.

02:05:18

I don't do it.

02:05:22

That. Uh, and then he murdered shoko.

02:05:31

Uh, but the silver dragon does turn a furious fucking glare on you. Explain yourselves. Well, we found these in the uh in the village rose village called. Oh, she just starts running away. Okay. Don't run. Look, i lied. I didn't actually shatter the zig. We found it like this, we gathered up the pieces because i thought maybe i could draw the dragons attacks for like a few seconds.

02:06:07

You can pick up the die. Sorry, that's so cool. We found them in the the under, you know, layer on your ground. The erotaki village that we passed through in the possession of some oracle who we who was working for a who was serving, what was his name? The demon lord of blizzards.

02:06:47

Shit. It was scissored. Yeah, serving sipid. And some lady in a tower, we think? And we're pretty sure he broke the eggs.

02:07:11

It seems to come down. Uh he obviously believes you with that 39 cents motive, they are good at that. We thank you most graciously for your aid in truth. I did very little, you know, she's gonna bow to the dragon and then say a prayer over the white dragon.

02:07:40

Uh, before you uh, before you head off, we actually have something we wanted to uh to to give to you. Uh we found this in a i think it was a camp of cannibals or something and he gets the the silver dragon hide banded male that the cupid talked about giving to him.

02:07:59

Yeah, we're like we didn't make it. We found this already made.

02:08:07

Um,

02:08:14

We don't know what rights your people do for the fallen, but we didn't think it right? To leave it with such folks. His soul will either return to the great river to be rejoined with the way bringer or he will go to the hawk. Most dragons only have two paths.

02:08:42

It was still kind of you to say a prayer for him.

02:08:51

I believe you were not responsible for the followed by brother that forged that armor, but it is worth a small fortune and you are a noble sort. I do not begrudge you. It's it's being kept or sold as you need. We believe even without my presence here, you would have ended the threat of this dragon.

02:09:21

Oh, maybe maybe not that. Uh, that storm he kicked up. She kicked up was quite debilitating to our mortalize.

02:09:39

Um, one question. Uh, because we can't think of anyone else. We might know all down in the oracles cave. We found reference to a woman on a tower. Why, what exactly? Did we learn about her that she was on which tower place called the storm spire? The storm spider, we believe he was taking orders from her.

02:10:09

So all of this could be traced back to whoever that is we couldn't learn any more. Does any of that? Do you have any inkling? That could be, i do not my kind does not go near the nameless fires. It is a curse and dark place from a long past.

02:10:38

If you are going there you must take caution and he looks at all fucking four of you specifically when he says take caution because we all just charged an adult white dragon, a maker. Got dropped. Oh she oh, she annoy. We're fucking kamikazeing. I wasn't you didn't go through this time.

02:11:07

I'm sorry also used. No i only got involved when a maker looks like she was gonna draw. Yeah. Oh, she saw and she went fuck sake. Gucci saw mako go down. I was trying to get the dragon off of her. That was his reasoning for that and show. Go.

02:11:24

Had the sanest least, suicidal plan ever. That was no the exact opposite of that shoko was like, hey, please fool around me. I will say that on the charge show, go does have a way. Choco does have a, what's it called? The Dodge? Yeah, dodging panache. So like that, that gets him out of all round attacks.

02:11:51

It doesn't when they have reach that's true. Oh yeah. Yeah. If if you come, if she came right up to me, but like on. Yeah, show code. She was coming right up to you. She was going to tear you to pieces and bear you beneath the ground. Shako was gonna like, try and like, Toro like bullfighter.

02:12:13

Just take like a five foot step back into the track. Keep exactly dude. Uh another dragon didn't even make an exagger opportunity to make it when she stood up his her soul. Focus became shoko. Yeah, that's what i was trying to do is draw all of its attacks to me and like try and piss it off.

02:12:35

So it wouldn't swing on a makeover more because he wasn't sure if she was alive or dead at that point and then she'll kill did the i'm gonna be deadbeat anyway, so i might as well. Yes, it off even more. Yeah, that's dragon had gotten off of full round of attacks, on any of you.

02:12:49

You probably would have died. Deleted any one of us all of us easily. Uh, total defense action. I do have an AC of 29. Well, she has a plus 16 to hit on over attacks. Yeah, like the math was before any boosts previously like that. The dragon had to roll looking natural three to miss.

02:13:08

So uh, for me back at like, 22, ACs and and she actually did a couple of times she wrote, yeah, after a couple of times. So, but 50. 50 on like, what? Like six attacks. You're still taking three dragon attacks. She'll go out a much better chance of surviving one of those the noches.

02:13:27

Yeah, so let's say, average of 20 damage, it was doing a lot of that, i don't think you understand what i'm saying, she was gonna do to you. So let me let me finish this forum. What's gonna happen is you're gonna get grappled. She was not gonna burrow and you were gonna suffocate.

02:13:45

Oh yeah. Okay she was gonna watch you die. Gasping even if not 75 damage, the odds are. You're taking three attacks out of the full attack and that's still, that's still kills. You dragons is dangerous. Yo, thank you. I'm taking the full attacks was the least damaging thing it could do.

02:14:12

You are a very benevolent GM for spreading out that full attack. Also still a dragon and an adult one at that like she thought she could win. All she's face. So far were level one into hunters. She hadn't faced an adventuring party. So her arrogance, look cave played in as well.

02:14:36

Yeah. Oh, she's gonna turn to a mako and ask her lady a mako, are you okay? You went down. I am weirdly fine. Thank you for saving my friend. What's the dragon's name? That's you guys have said it a couple times but i don't remember what it is. That's one aswan.

02:14:58

I am. I'm greatly in your debt. Well, that's the short version of his name, aslan.

02:15:08

There are no debts to be had, you helped me get rid of a dangerous creature, that was murdering people. So i am concerned to find out that humans did in fact kill and take her eggs. It's hard to see the justification either way, but certainly understandable range. He kind of stumps the ground a little bit.

02:15:34

Dragonlings were murdered before. They could even take their first breath. There is no argument of justification, thousands of years of life, were taken in an instant by humans. Who do not understand the cost. Oh yes, but i do not think that the the people across the countryside. Here were responsible for that.

02:15:59

So, i will not argue with you. I just you have just told me. They were one specific person. I'm just saying that it's a terrible loss of life on all friends. The one who is responsible? We plan to visit very soon here after we return, the village and tell them that their nightmare is over.

02:16:20

We strike out for the spiers and we will ask this woman, whoever she may be what exactly she has to say for herself. Was it not the oracle guy who smashed up the dragon eggs.

02:16:39

Uh, yes. Why the he did the deed but on someone else. Yeah, so okay.

02:16:53

I will speak with the people of ikaliad.

02:17:01

Might i suggest you go. So in something, a little less refined they will probably take it badly on seeing through a pencils. I did quiet. Can you want me? Yes, koi koya wants you. I really hurt you. Ask the other kind of sit down at the skunk bag. I found useless in this fight.

02:17:25

I got did nothing. They did all the way as gracings. Like levitating like 20 feet in the air. That's all right. Zero. You're you're narcolepsy. Just kicked in for the first little bit there. Okay, they're not dead. I'd consider that a bonus and all accounts. So how about we go back rink away today and then consider?

02:17:52

What was that visiting so many? There's no way. Is she indicates to her weapons, the ever, so chiming missed. That seems to be responsible for all of our tropicals today. All right. Good part. Yeah, i think you're missing one step in your plan, though. You see there's a there's a dragon layer and horde just over there.

02:18:22

I was hoping you weren't going to notice, honestly, but you were freak of nature, so i should expect. Different says, no is she starts walking in that direction?

02:18:36

I must return to my brood now that my mission is done. Oh, how old do you have any pictures shoko will turn and gesture X? This whole nonsense. Do you know what these are? This is the second one we found so far. I know they bring the dead and they have begun moving across the entirety of the north appearing or moving.

02:19:10

And you mean the dead or the obelisks? Where there's an obelisk. There is the dead. I'm pretty much both. This is all very disturbing. It is. I am hoping my kinsman will act and do something about it, but many of us do not dabble in the affairs of the two leggers.

02:19:39

Much of my kind believed them about such things. Well, once again, that's when we thank you for everything you've done for us here and wish you good portion you as well. I know two bows again.

02:20:03

And he takes off flying with his 200 foot fly speed. He's very fast. Uh i'm suppose i get a want to. Oh you guys all did get that everyone get that channel. That's, that's a channel.

02:20:28

Yeah, because there was damage all over and OG will scar you off. After no way. And bring grace in along to count. All of the the coins. All right, those skills. We got the phrase of plus six. Well, okay, so shuffle will leave with someone else to harvest the dragon parts while he goes up to look at coins, uh, starter.

02:20:57

So as you get closer to the huge rift that goes down, you can roll perception. Oh god. Yeah. Fucking she had fucking minions, didn't she? We're gonna have to fight a bunch of cobalts or something.

02:21:24

I don't even know. I had role perception, man.

02:21:34

So doing a survival to try to harvest stuff from the dragon body after the silver. Dragon leaves. Probably wise.

02:21:48

Did it go? Here we are. The white dragon made her layer underneath the ice pack about 60 miles. North of Ocalia in a vertical rift that spans a fast gulf over a sub glacial rock spiers to do the 20 foot wide rift stretches over. A hundred feet long at ground level, but narrows to half that below before widening into a massive sub glacial.

02:22:12

Chasm, 400 feet deep.

02:22:18

And at the bottom of the chasm we got over 25. Uh oh gee grayson. The video ochi Grayson and zio gonna go. It's in the dark.

02:22:40

It is in the door area.

02:22:54

Seriously, what the fuck?

02:23:09

Now, i can't find it. Oh, there it is among the jagged rocks buyers at the very bottom of the glacial. Rift lies, the remains of a

02:23:28

Uh, little more than an examination at this point, or a little more than a skeleton at this point.

02:23:39

I didn't hear any of that. Yeah, i didn't either. Oh, there's a white dragon skeleton at the bottom of the chasm. Is there now tell me

02:24:02

I'm never gonna get a chance again. Oh she's gonna point his little arm with his tattoo. That koya gave him down there and trying to detect any illusions.

02:24:13

I mean, it's bad. Yeah, i just realized i'm like never mind. Oh, she's gonna jump and then on the way down detect. Illusions. 400 feet is there. Is there fucking ball, he's gonna Mario jump. Um, across the chasm back and forth to get down now. Well, um, is there any sort of way to get down there?

02:24:42

I'm going to assume no because it's a natural formation and the dragon was flying in and out.

02:24:51

It's so long as it's not entirely smooth nose. Swing this on into that one. And no, i have to climb speed so you guys

02:25:11

Can we climb down your way down? I'm down to climb down. So you can climb down.

02:25:27

Okay, roll to climb down since i don't have a climb speed. Let's do it. Certainly that that is what i expected when he asked to climb down. Sorry.

02:25:43

So i'm going to spend, i'm gonna spend a foreign action and a parking point, the cheat and just don't uh, i'm gonna cast this on myself and you know, okay, if i need to, i will cast and something else on everybody else. Is it feather fault apology? I would say even better.

02:26:11

I just but levitate, maybe slower but it's also much safer and a 400 foot drop, then featherfall, which could run out of its duration. Indeed. Is there anything up here or is like

02:26:35

Choco says, looking around is zeo jumps in the way. Just starts walking down the side of the chasm and grayson and OG start climbing. So about 50 feet down, you find an entrance to a cave, just into the side of the cliff. Oh, can i get one of those levitates?

02:27:04

Yeah. No, i can't because it's personal but i will cast fly on. Oh, and technically grace and still has fly grace and chooses to climb. Anyways. I mean, i'm pretty sure it took us more than seven minutes to like hike all the way over here. Uh yes you weren't that close.

02:27:28

You had to go up the the ice and the pack, you could have just flown up and waited for them though.

02:27:37

You know, i could get up there without any issues. She has a climb speed, you apply.

02:27:46

Let's stick with ochi, let's uh, all right. Well, what do i see in this cave? I just see the entrance to a cave. I'm gonna check out enough for her to go into and out of. Okay, i'm gonna go down to the cave entrance and look inside, looks like a tunnel into a pretty cave.

02:28:08

I think i found the the layer, possibly, this looks like where the dragon could have fit

02:28:19

OT says bird. Like and then i'm gonna make my way in like a little bit and then wait for everybody walk in like 10 feet and wait for everybody. Try this. Take by lumpty. Takes a little while, doesn't it? 20 feet around. Okay, 15 seconds. You get there.

02:28:52

Oh god. We need the monkey. The monkey has our bag of holding.

02:28:59

What is the monkey? Have the bag. He's the bagman is in the box. He's got the bag of senzu beans. Yeah, krilling. That's already seen. Daddy being daddy. It's fair. Uh, so you head back to the caravan that makes Helgaval. Um, the cat uh, no. You guys all head up to the treasure show.

02:29:34

Go strikes out on his own to bet. Uh, the people we left behind because so like wait how how far away is the caravan? Probably at least a good mile or two. You didn't want it to be within range of the dragon. Okay, okay. So yeah. Yeah, you guys can help you within the range of a dragon though, you guys can head up there and uh, and get things set up while she'll go goes and fetches way in.

02:30:06

And the caravan click up around and pick up the stuff for you guys soco has fly, right? You can just fly over there. Oh yeah. Yeah, if you get if you don't give choker fly then yeah i already keep track of flight. Yeah. Come along friends. Did anything on how much stuff we have to carry?

02:30:37

I might be able to solve that issue.

02:30:44

Your magic. Either explodes things or frankly defies the laws of physics and now not for this partified the logic buildings. Yes, put the logic physics. Also, encompass, a lot of stab, frankly,

02:31:03

Well we can decide if we're going to wait for showcode to come back with way and i would like to raise a point though is you said that this cave it maybe i mishard. You looked large enough that it could be the dragon's layer but the spacing is says, otherwise squeezing is a thing.

02:31:19

So, i just it's she also has a burrow speed. Oh, that's true. Okay. This tunnel likely was created from her burrowing in and out of her layer so much.

02:31:33

And on that note. Now it does the invisible side. So are we waiting for showcode to come back with the monkey?

02:31:46

So you hear a voice in your ear that just goes. Yeah, pan. But some of us also have other box. That's true. I have a bag. Also have something called the arcane pocket, okay? That's three out of most of the pcs in here, rider left, zero, pick one.

02:32:10

I was, let's go. Let's go left. You you hear an echoing whistle all the whistle. That is who it opens up over here and this map is gorgeous. Thank you. On a scale of one to ten. This is for sure bussing. So is is this area down here? Like so this is water.

02:32:45

That's okay. From a freshwater mountainous spring. Oh, okay. Sorry trip, something really quick. You guys go farther than i thought you did. Uh, over here looks like a really solid big place to chill. You see some steam kind of rolling around in there?

02:33:16

Oh,

02:33:22

This is a really nice place. Someone who can walk over water.

02:33:31

If you were visible and you walked across the water in front of OG OG images, assume that if he like focused, he could do it too and then try and then fall in the water, but your invisible. Well you you don't have to play. Yeah, i i i can't even say that you would have been able to see like footballs or anything to specifically like steps.

02:33:51

Does not do that. It is level ninja, ninja ninja ability, isn't it? Yes. No, i'm not sure how much more sarcasm i can put into my voice, but i just mean, like, o2 would be like, oh, that's so sick. I didn't know we could do that. Just following the water we you hear here is you put one foot in the water and go through it i am going to cast.

02:34:22

Let's just in case there's anything invisible. Congrats, you find Noah you find. No way, there could be other things that are invincible in this damn place. If i know i'd picking her nose, i guess invisibility was never mentioned involving the dragon at all. But okay, um, okay, what's a long?

02:34:47

Jump, DC, i'm gonna jump the water.

02:34:52

Uh, five higher than normal. You are kind of walking on icy rock 26. So i assume it's probably like a 20 or 25 to get that newly. We'll get you over there. Yeah, but that's like the bank. I think uchi falls in the water and they climbs up. I just like looking at my pretty nice.

02:35:11

So these are so awesome. Oh yeah. Walks across the water. I've never played in rule 20, but i'm just gonna assume that role 20 could never the pretty dice the the cool effects in here. It really can't keep up. No, i'm just going to are. I'm just going to dimensional slide a block across.

02:35:39

Uh grace is gonna climb down into the water and swim down here where he starts looking at this stuff. That's under the water. You found the dragon's horde you spotted it. Get on you, i wasn't gonna say anything. Okay. Oh, it was the instrument that gave it away. He was a odd shape.

02:36:05

This is statue with no head over here. I think quite a few tests in here and a shield. And mirror. So what's inside is this like some aurora borealis stuff going on it kind of is? Yeah, that's really rad. Okay, i know you're working and wait for that. Go ahead as you start examining the stuff that's in the flowing water.

02:36:31

Uh, the entire cave shakes.

02:36:54

No way. I got this and the game shakes and collapses and it says you died. You failed the test of greed. And then it goes black screen and then slowly fades and you're on a wagon. And this guy says you finally awake, it's happening just know it. Nobody for the skyrim.

02:37:18

Meme horse, i never played much skyrim but here's where we're going to take our little break. I really have to go to the bathroom. What the fuck is, right? No, i where did you go? Anyone. Oh no. The yep. Yep, the automatically.

02:37:47

So you haven't said, roll an issue, so it's just looking at us scarily, or it's break time. And again, is afk. So damn it. Please hold ice chewing my bad question. All right. Well, happy break everyone. I'm gonna go look at my baby. Yeah, that's a good use. Being are you being nice to?

02:38:35

Well, at least reinforcements are on the way.

02:38:52

We may, we may let them, we may not live.

02:39:01

Can't imagine the skeletal dragon is going to be harder than the the living ones. So something something wrong. Is something something? I'm sure we'll be fine. Sure, will be, and i'm legitimately. I'm so, Until we hit until we invited for around and we find out it's on a skeleton dragon.

02:39:26

But brother a dragon bitch. Yeah, yeah. That's that's kind of like Draco. Lich robin dog? I'm like yeah, that was the ones that i just i'm like, okay so what it what AP we play next. What are we? What's next on the cards books?

02:39:50

Who wants him? Who wants? Who all wants to die next.

02:40:05

I'm gonna grab a drink. Yeah, me too. Yes.

02:43:36

Why?

02:44:46

I am returned. Welcome back.

02:45:02

Are we missing anyone?

02:47:00

We're waiting on ochi to his currently saying him. Apparently, what saying hello to his time

02:47:24

Recent swimming in the water. Accounting.

02:47:45

Why i heard condone timer? I don't know. There shouldn't be one. I haven't even clicked start yet, i know.

02:48:22

No way. You were also not on this trivia. How am i not on this? Seems like an absolute disaster. Don't know what you're, but i'm on a mission if i'm here.

02:48:38

Picks out earbud with let's get ready to die playing.

02:48:52

Exact.

02:49:07

Now.

02:49:38

I don't know if any of you care about football, but football history was just made with these single biggest comeback ever. When you talking about hand deck, football hand-day football. Yes. Uh, no. No, it's fine. The vikings were down 330 at halftime and they pulled it back to a 39.

02:50:04

36 victory again. Um, oh no.

02:50:17

Uh, which one is indiana again? Colts. The Colts are we waiting on me? Is everybody back? Oh, i'm so sorry the baby's. Really cute. I didn't even realize the Vikings were playing today. I do not understand obsession with this game. Hand egg and they Care about it. I don't much care about hand ache myself.

02:50:52

But, uh, i do think it's now worthy that a literal world record was just set. As soon as i realize that modern day sports games were the modern game time of the arena fights of roam. I lost all interest in these kind of sports together when you have to turn it into a game like pathfinder and do math.

02:51:16

Like i don't watch games but i have played a season of fantasy football and that shit was fire.

02:51:27

I do like the theory that fantasy football is just the jock version of dnd it. Is it absolutely is.

02:51:37

Um, i rolled and i rolled bad and i'm sorry. It took so long. I was just looking at my baby. He's very cute. He came out with a full head of hair and he's very handsome. Oh, you the poor mama so much. Heartburn. She didn't have it till after the baby really, really?

02:51:59

Yeah, there's a lot of heritage and they give a lot of heartburn to the mother. Now, i have heartburn all the time because of who i am as a person and the way that i eat but she doesn't really get it. Nothing but sugar and spicy stuff and that hurts all the time.

02:52:19

I have one of the gigantic things of tons in my truck and i take like three every single morning. He used to take one of those. Um like Prilosec or something like that and then i found out you can like get cancer heart disease, or something terrible from it, okay?

02:52:41

The hell. This thing is sure, even though it's a skeleton, as it's kind of, what i think it's gonna be archana, or is it really big religion? It looks very much like a white dragon, like a white dragon. You just fought actually.

02:53:08

So what? 29, it looks like a reanimated dragon.

02:53:17

Does it look like they look like the dragon? We just fought or does it look like it is the dragon. Exactly like the dragon. You just bought another french toast. Oh my god's because we left it next to the envelope. Ding ding ding winner winner. Chicken dinner. Yeah, we did.

02:53:34

I was like oh man. The question would Grayson's survival carving up of the body have made any difference. No. Does it reconstitute its natural armor after no ways carving off? Its the hide? It gets its natural armor back after the blade. Damage was done. This is bullshit. So how much can an arcane point to up the DC of the next slide cast?

02:54:09

I hope the bone checker.

02:54:17

I don't know, i don't think this thing has any bones.

02:54:24

It's made entirely of hatred. I think i'm in, it's fine. The number of questions that i asked about these stupid obelisks for this to still happen.

02:54:39

Yeah, i wonder if that means, if if a mako had died, if we would have had a like a reserve or like an undead amanka with us. Yes, probably. Maybe.

02:54:54

And we just do a what's that movie where they like mime the corpse pro. Uh weekend at Bernie's. Yeah, we just weekend at Bernie's, our way, all the way to mankai the dragon roars at the tit. Uh, but not with as much damage as you were probably hoping and it does not move as the just force of the drag.

02:55:23

Undead. Dragons charisma. Boosted safe.

02:55:30

Well, actually, right. I'm going to, you know, i've spent another arcane point. You pretty much dimension slide.

02:55:46

Here.

02:55:51

They're real fucking over fuck's sake.

02:55:59

So ceilings how higher the ceilings?

02:56:09

About 100 feet tall in here and that's like, in this central cavern like over where the dragon is now, is like, i'm assuming a little bit, a little bit shorter. Yeah. This is this is only about 40 feet tall. This is 100 feet tall right on, okay, so attempt to climb out of the water.

02:56:32

Might be a good idea. Um, and then we'll take one shot, i guess.

02:56:51

It bounces off its scales slash flabby skin flaps slash bones little positive, no way.

02:57:12

What the fuck?

02:57:23

And this thing, see me. I probably, right.

02:57:54

And you need. I'm gonna have it.

02:58:04

First off where it was. In fact no no i'm not gonna waste time. I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna do that. I'm not going to do that. I am going to end my turn and you are going to tell me how tell you how Tell you how to do.

02:58:21

What how it eats me? Ah, i it's not it fully focuses on gracing when he damages it.

02:58:31

Tiredness. But all right, video did

02:58:48

Do i oh i'm an actor yet so i can't stab. They have come about me boxes. I just not yet assume the Grayson was the one that hit that damage that i got technically oh fuck.

02:59:08

Oh my yeah, bro. You're deleted. You're gone. Sorry, that's true life. That's not good yet.

02:59:27

I mean, unless you have diehard though you're in a pretty shitty spot. Yeah, i have a very shitty spot in in what way. Are you not dead yet? That's that's like maybe a second image. I met negative points. It was healthy house. You're also within five feet of it.

02:59:49

Yes, i am. I i have 45 health. I'm down and i'm at negative nine. Yes, and now i go, please tell me. You still have biasmacol resistance? Yes, i do. You might not die from the cold water around it. Then, this may be important. It's a secret tool. We'll use for later.

03:00:12

So about, where am i at this point in time? Well, since everyone asked if you wanted to wait for show, go to go back from the caravan and everyone kind of just said, no, and kept walking. It's got a couple miles away. You said the caravan was one mile away, i said one or two miles away because he's in a mile is with a range of a dragon.

03:00:34

Okay. Well, i'm gonna be impression, though. I like so, we can be resurrected later when she'll go finds our bodies. Buried to the snap also that too. I was like how did you they not see it flying and then i like oh it probably came. It came from underground.

03:00:59

It gave him underground because you are underground now. Friends. Can we say uh as shoko took off in the other direction? If he saw the dragon rise up into the sky behind him, he probably would have turned it in. We just discussed the height burrowed underground. Oh, burrowed. So everyone that saw the attack.

03:01:24

Uh, so how is this gonna work? Because i've saved against the frightful presence today, uh, you did, you're fine. Oh, it's because it's not this it is real big just just oh, she's just like i'm not scared. It is technically the same creatures though. Oh god. We'll use the first numbers.

03:01:48

You're just shaking. You start off shaking and then it improves, doesn't it? No to the way around, you shake it. You get frightened. And then it pays.

03:02:07

It varies though. It varies some creatures. Don't have the ability to frighten things, they just make shake it so it will have to read them. Very mean or shaken based on hd.

03:02:26

Where is it in notes?

03:02:39

Okay. It is at the very first age category that gets sprite full presence. So i'm going to assume it has regular private presence on a field. So, the opponent is shaken or panic if you are for hd of. If you are white, four, hit dice for hit dice, or less or less.

03:03:04

Okay? So you go, you're just shaking that. Well, i will take being shake and create some succeeder fail with b18. Anything is expressed, okay?

03:03:32

Is immune to it. So weigh-in is going to go ahead and use her saving throw. It's better than his so it is when here.

03:03:50

No.

03:03:55

It drops him on the map before took a win. Okay. All right. So that was the dragon's turn.

03:04:09

Making a coyote turn.

03:04:15

Uh, um.

03:04:40

Gonna go right here. The range.

03:04:52

After watching it fight before. Do i know how far it's reaches? I you could guess the main and you are in it. And she can't click channel because she had to move to get him in range. But do you got eight points of healing? That's still unconscious. Okay.

03:05:23

Where's my button? There's my button.

03:05:30

Oh, she's going to use bar and brawler to gain the benefit of a combat feet. That i do not possess for one minute combat feet that i'm going to game is spring attack and then he's going to. So that's one move action. He's gonna take another move action and run.

03:05:58

Like over here, say and draw his weapons as he does. Are you going to acrobatics to avoid being attacked? Uh, i think that was only 25 feet so i will was trying not to get swung on

03:06:19

30 feet. So i'll move one space shorter than that. His cmd is 35, it's 35. All right, so he hits me and i take the attack, you are behind him. And while i know facing rules for dragons, don't actually exist, he still swipes you with the tail because it makes sense.

03:06:43

It sure does. I'll take that image and i moved one space closer because that's how i far, i could have gotten with acrobatics very good, and that's my turn.

03:07:07

Oh, i forgot to roll this on the dragon's. Turn, boom. Boom. I see how you take one point of frost damage. Why does he take one? Because it does a d6 damage and he has resistance five. What? I have taken that six also. No, it's only like within five feet of him.

03:07:41

For me. Yeah, i'll make a is, our mayco is back at the beginning of the cave. That's not crazy here. Here and judging this in charging distance.

03:08:08

It's a lot of mad shit for someone in charge and distance above with the slight eagles. Ah, god, she missed. Can someone refresh me on the order of operations to do the measure with the turn? There was like a keys old one down to start and then release it and then press it again.

03:08:31

I want to say it control or space. I think it was control.

03:08:43

Uh you hold control drag to where you want to measure your turn to release the click click again, and then you can go in a new direction. Neo make a concierge jack for me. Yeah.

03:09:05

Take a bunch of damage bust.

03:09:11

Grayson.

03:09:18

He's just gonna unload the arrows.

03:09:32

All right. First one, mrs. Second one. Hits. Third one. Misses, fourth one hits. Man. Grayson, you are noticing something rather uncomfortable. Not what i wanted to do nothing, it seems like this dragon is even harder to damage than it was before.

03:10:01

Would be fun. All right.

03:10:10

Oh dear.

03:10:15

The fuck is no way. Oh, there you are. I've been i got the dragon selected this entire time.

03:10:24

Um, i don't know. See me now.

03:10:44

So, i think

03:10:49

I think i can get tell me about her books.

03:10:59

Um, no.

03:11:09

It's a lovely decent, i imagine the answers. Now the answer is no, the only reason eventually is because it doesn't have combat reflexes. I don't know. I don't know. That's fair.

03:11:34

Um yeah. What are you doing to your hp? I'm trying to fix it. Stop! Stop negative three. I should be at negative three.

03:11:48

I'm trying to fix and it was saying of that negative form. Like i said, negative 3.

03:11:55

So when you are doing that, reset your HP to zero and then apply the negative. Okay. What happens when you add negatives negatives?

03:12:06

You upset the the computer system. It doesn't like doing it. No. Hey, please continue.

03:12:16

Yeah, there's there's like no goods. Good way this. So i'm i'm just a super wild. We're gonna see if kind of cause i can actually do something this time. Because yeah, all right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fucking dragon. Here you go.

03:12:37

Uh, you you hit but you're not christ, unfortunately.

03:12:44

Like i know you have more than a seven to attack. That's right, you're shaking. I am. I am very you take five points and recoil. As as the blade makes contact the bounce back. As there's this red marking that just burns into the side of her face and she's like, can we not today?

03:13:11

Fucking not.

03:13:17

Oh, the dragon's turn. Is it immune to sneak attack? Boom. It's aware of her presence. I'm not flanking. Yeah, i was wondering i was like there's three different ways. This could be going video. Nothing a minko and no i do take the cold damage.

03:13:44

I mean they still have the cold resistances. No, they don't it only land, 10 minutes. Yeah, that's way gone. That's why i forgot to say it on my turn. We need to not bunch up.

03:14:02

Thanks forge is what happened kickname?

03:14:14

Are you used to be? Okay. No, but thanks for asking.

03:14:27

I'm sorry. Uh, all right. Sorry, i need. So, we will resolve the attacks on omegaverst.

03:14:45

But i surely this version of the dragon is somewhat weakened compared to what it she wants. Was it has much less hp. Did i make you feel better a little bit? No.

03:15:06

Fact i got criminated right off the fucking bag. Yeah, that didn't really help. It also no longer has its wing attacks because they are tattered and not strong.

03:15:22

Weighing attack. That's cool. So kicked me out of forge again for some reason and now i can't get back.

03:15:35

Fill in here. So i'm gonna take this completely. Yeah, you should be only get back in now. That was weird and

03:16:00

Are you letting Meccan? Nope, still can't get back in.

03:16:10

Uh, terry refreshing your page completely. I i have i have closed all of my browsers. Clean and can refit the server really quick. That should probably fix it. I just like to know why i kicked me out one. I do not know.

03:16:41

That was weird.

03:17:24

Spring. Now i can't access porridge i can log in on the game master, not on my own.

03:17:37

What the favorite? No, you could see mine. I've never tried just log in on it, be like, oh i'm just going to delete this monster, just this one. And this one, and this one, everybody should be known. Now, if motherfuckers start messing with my compendiums, i put a lot of work into things.

03:17:57

Maybe we should all bounce out. Oh no. You guys are back now. Well, at least sans is back. I mean it's a bit of password on your on your stuff. We can't get into it. I i prefer to trust people until they give me a reason not to and if you if someone fucks with my companions and i find out about it, they'll be banned for my games.

03:18:20

I wouldn't do that. So don't worry that that one, but i tell you fucked up. Yeah, i know you probably would you'd also be clever enough to make an export of the creature before you mess with it so that you can just load it back in for me, correct.

03:18:36

I will forgot. I just lost connection too. I restarted the server so hopefully that'll force whatever shadow. Abby what clinging on there? I'm not taking shadow clone until next level. Yeah, i'm come on. Got me some slack.

03:19:09

Day. I exist again. That's nice. I like existing well you returned to a claw and tail slap attack. Um, i don't like that. I don't like existing anymore. I would like to own exist, right? But abby, i didn't quit you. This game yet no video ate the credit at the very beginning of the fight.

03:19:37

Yeah, i did not have to about that. At least. I'm not. I did die in this instantly. You're, you're right. You're right to be sad between the confusion thing last week and the flame strike i got to do on those anti-paladins this week. Like, oh my god. That was so beautiful.

03:19:56

I love the graphic. You set up for that because i didn't set that up. Yeah, i did because i was messing around, then i was like, oh, we can, we can make this fun. You can, i gave everyone full access to those files, so everyone can modify their spells however, they like it if they learn how to do it.

03:20:12

Yeah. How do the weapon attack ones work? I'd love to do some cool stuff with that. I don't know if i can give you permission to modify automated animations but i will check after this. I don't have to close out of chrome. This isn't going well. Yeah, i'm having loading problems right now.

03:20:34

I can't even i don't even see the. Uh, as long as lick, it might be a foundry thing.

03:20:42

Up. There we go. I'm stuck on downloading world data. Name. It does seem to be taking a second. The game might be getting bulky again, so i'll do some cleanups of maps. We've already gone through since we're coming up on time anyways. And shoko is miles away. I think i'm gonna log off here with you tomorrow.

03:21:09

Yeah, see you tomorrow, guys. You're in strange jones, right? Yeah. Okay. I am the rat lad. Yes, i fucking love you. So bright think i almost have this party is in that game. It's a good game. I'm glad you guys are enjoying it. I'm back in. How's everyone doing?

03:21:30

All right, get some rest bud. Then i just catch you next time.

03:21:40

Complete my encounters. The level. Okay. Sorry. I did take uh, well a claw and the taleswipe did use up. It is correct. They're still in the chat. Look close. I'll take a 13 from the truck from the tail slab which of these claws. The one that's targeting. You neither of them are targeting attacks.

03:22:03

You can't seem to targets that i put in. No. Oh there must be a permission that i'm missing then the the claw right above the tail slap yours. Yeah, that's it. Did have the target when you did the roll, but now, that we're back in, it's not there. Oh yeah, weird.

03:22:19

But yes, i have happily taken that. Thank you, but belong and now it's coyote's turn and she's gonna pull a coya.

03:22:32

Her signature skill. Quick channel, quick channel. Yeah. Fuck.

03:22:45

He steps here. First into range.

03:22:53

Luckily channel energy, doesn't provoke.

03:23:04

It's a flag.

03:23:09

And she is healing not damaging by the way.

03:23:16

That's not get out of the fridge. Someone needs you. I know. God. Damn it woman. Oh oh, i'm sorry, i'm listening. Oh, there we go.

03:23:35

I need to play on fire from dozen or one of your games. Manages, dude, i loves me some, some clerics of jezzanite, especially, and pilgrims. That archetype is crack, it's pretty good. Especially when you worship, does that? I like how it basically says? So you don't have to wash it as well but um, you might as well but you might as well.

03:23:58

Yeah, because you're getting the travel domain. Anyway, just for being in the archetype and if you take a god, doesn't give you traveled, then it gives them to travel something. Well, it gives me the trouble domain and then removes their other domain. Yeah. Oh gee, i'm just Hadarius. It's also a good archetype for a priests of obso.

03:24:32

You're doing some bouncing attacks. There wrote? Yeah, we're gonna run in to hear. Yes. Going to run into there. This is all with spring attack. So i'm moving attacking at this point and then i'm going to continue to move provoking no attacks of opportunity.

03:24:56

It shouldn't really have moved through a square, but i didn't line up the way i wanted to.

03:25:05

Uh, question about spring attack, does your movement get protected after the attack or throughout the entire process? Turn off the entire process. Fantastic. Oh my god. My lion blade just became so much better. And i had no idea. Oh, yeah. Yeah, let's have played them. They were like, designs to be spring attackers.

03:25:27

Yeah, with like a glaze or like a naughty nada. Really. Um, i'm going to wait. Fuck that volcan. Oh, sorry. I was talking about warrior but i didn't hear you. I'm going to bluff as part of that to faint. If possible, can you do that? As part of your thumb?

03:25:48

I'm sure you can because you're a warrior, but yes, you can do it as part of the move, move action or as part of spring attack. Yeah. Kitchen is my speak. Yeah, yeah. I i was like i'm sure you know can do that. I'm just, i can't remember how.

03:26:06

Male may not be making footnotes for, for other characters, so it's ladies. Ignore me whiz, plus something. Plus something else or sense of motive, whichever is higher.

03:26:19

I think it's like the cmb plus with or b a b plus wiz and you also 10 plus b, a b plus wins horror since motive if it's hot yeah i should have that ready? Sorry, i think it's a plus or though because it's not a humanoid. Yes, it does.

03:26:42

Or minus four. I take a minus 4. Yes. Okay, so that is an 18 and that's going to be a no boss. Yes or no? Okay, that's fine. I don't think i even needed to do that anyways because i'm flanking with a mako. Correct. Yes, you are good. It just would have made it easier.

03:27:04

I put it. Come on. Thank you platform. It doesn't really do much against this thing. It has a vector 14. Yeah, i know. I know.

03:27:20

I just like being hyped. Oh my god. Heartbreaking, the include. Flinging it does. I'm sorry. That is a mist then that's okay. And then continue movement for 10 more feet to make 50.

03:27:42

And that's why i'm going to be doing for the rest of this fight. That's my turn. You can do omeco.

03:27:55

By footsteps. Okay. Turn this on to get flanking with. No, a and get her 1d6 of snake attack damage because she's still gotta love. Love rogue. Which at some point she might retrain the ninja and she'll need your help with that.

03:28:22

She's trying to immerse herself in the culture. So amigo's, a weeb, she's becoming one, an asian weeb, a tion weep. I'm sorry, not sure how i should feel about the appropriation of my culture. When also it's only half of my culture and it's also entirely herspep. Not sure that is a super hit plus 14 and her last night birthday.

03:29:02

I forgot. I was gonna challenge. Not that it would have mattered, but she smell it last year. And so, she is going to use her last lay on hands for the day as well.

03:29:16

Don't forget to remove your inspire, your courage, unless you have someone to do. Oh yes.

03:29:27

Never remember to think of that off.

03:29:40

Art cells known. Oh, she's still got herself. Casting. Oops, i gotta be said at some point.

03:30:01

Zero. I'm he's kind of, he's kind of his conscious now. Now i just can't. Remember if i could do this bomb prone, power sack. No. Yes, you can sweet. You're still prone where you arrive, but yes. So, yeah, i'm gonna spend our key point.

03:30:30

Take off your incapacitated and just make you prone. Yeah, then i'm going to a little bit.

03:30:43

Over here. Well i'm prone. So the dragon, like looks back down at, where zeal was

03:30:56

And then looks over where he is, kind of like a dog who was looking for a toy that went missing and of course i'm going to find another arcane point out the cash level of the spell. Sorry, the DC. That's a fucking sad, fireball.

03:31:22

I don't know, man. It's a fireball. And if this is still remotely white dragon, then big pain.

03:31:35

Yeah, dc2 21.

03:31:42

Hey pain. It failed.

03:31:52

I'm trying to generate in fiery energy. What? It only had hp left. I told you it had much like much less HPHP, well that was terrifying.

03:32:12

Not as a blessed for me and i'm currently on the ground.

03:32:21

He stands up.

03:32:34

So, uh,

03:32:44

And we're like crazy. Just jumps back in the water. Can we like fucking leave? When he's done your idea. Yeah, i'll be all right.

03:33:02

Desna doesn't go back to her seat. I see, she did OT will come over and help. Grayson unload, our sick loop. All right, which i'm just gonna straight up posts in here because there's a lot of stuff and you guys can easily identify it.

03:33:35

What is the horse terracotta talisman?

03:33:42

Me give to the back of the book. It's time right now.

03:33:55

Are you here we are. I know, i know the terracotta. Uh, talisman the horse specifically, these ceramic statues are molded in the likeness of armored soldiers, horses or dogs and are considered symbols of good. Fortune in battle. Once per day, the possessor of a terracott Hotelsman can reroll a single attack role.

03:34:17

As an immediate action with a plus. One luck bonus on the reroll and keeps the most favorable results. A terracotta, healthman also contains the vestige of a spirit of an ancient warrior or warbies that can be called upon once per day, as a standard action to manifest itself. As spiritual force.

03:34:35

The terracotta horse creates a phantom steed. That's rad.

03:34:49

A bit in the items, 18 specific magic item.

03:35:05

It's a lot of money, too.

03:35:21

A ring of feather falling. Yep, you know, to make it easier to get down to uh, look at her for ex-husband's. Bones. Oh yeah. No like no, no. I like i gets out of hair around this. All right. There's another thing down there. Can we just make sure that's absolutely dead dead.

03:35:44

It is he was nowhere near an obelisk. Yes. But no it is. Okay. They have them all set up and separate. Actually, so the terracotta horse is in the items tab or whoever ends up with that. If you end up with that, i should say.

03:36:24

You know what? Absolutely boggles me. The wide dragons don't wear any gear. Fun fact. Uh, i recommend taking a read dragonstone the dragon stomach. Um, it's a module, it's pathfinder module. It's one of the earlier ones. And the big bad evil guy is literally a green dragon who uses a plethora of magic items to fuck with you pretty good.

03:36:57

Just don't get why they don't. Yeah that one is literally it's it's it's right up is like, yeah. Okay. So he uses his dragon hold because he's a green dragon and that's what they do. So um, here's the stats. For the staff he's using and the ring, he's using.

03:37:15

And the club the details also using like it's it's really good. Dragons are nudists everyone. Apparently pride. I think a lot of it is probably like, oh, look at these. Nice things. Aren't they aren't very nice but i do not need them. I am dragon. My, my natural power far up skills.

03:37:39

I think if you have the dragon thought, we'll use the items. I better cover jugging would use the fuck out of items. Are you kidding me? A couple dragon is looking for those wands of like, hideous, laughter doing nothing. That's founding them. Yep, it's doing fun. Shit like video.

03:38:03

Well, that was rad that was terrifying. When the dragon came back, not not gonna lie. I went. Well, it's like gaming was there's a map for this? This is going to end poorly, but i didn't think poorly. Yeah. I truly just started the fact that goddamn fireball i was gonna say it didn't actually go that poorly but your wizard engaged first did all of the damage to it and then it got it certain and it's not a mindless undead you know i probably started off that combo for the fireball.

03:38:48

Huh. I mean, yeah, it would have that. What it would have been a thing you did immediately put a target on your back when you firewall made. Well, the first time i did, i did i did a bone shaker and technically it wouldn't have done anything. It wouldn't have done anything.

03:39:05

Would have done any damage, it still didn't have. So before we wrap up, is it possible that we explore the rest of this? I know, we're like way over time already, but oh, we are over time. But there's, there's, it's a beautiful cave. Other than that, this goes into the underwater river where the dragon likes to swim.

03:39:25

This clearly is where it likes to sleep. I see this over here is like a little crystal formation or a flower or something. That is where the eggness was, okay. I was like that looks important to you.

03:39:47

Yeah, i had already made this pretty map when you guys decided to try and fight it flying. So i'm really glad you came. Looking forward to it and then follow it again. Anyways. Oh, you fought it by the obelisk that made me pretty happy. Actually i was like, optional fight.

03:40:08

Yes.

03:40:12

Yeah, i hope everyone had fun. That's cool. Uh everyone can also go ahead and level. Yes. Yeah. So, before spells

03:40:29

Gonna need them. Radical, now i have decision. Uh, have to decide things that is fair. I really need to go today. Yeah, you should. You should definitely. Oh, but if you have any time later, if you want to talk about, like, the same stuff that we're talking about it, oh yeah.

03:40:59

Um my mini group is supposed to meet in person tonight but i am available on this chord, fair enough. I'll not distract you but it's i don't actually even really want to play tonight. So i know mine gabbing. I'm just there to be a wall fair enough. I guess.

03:41:19

Hey, you're not the only one. Who's the party tank? Yeah, yeah. Usually tanker heeler. I like, i like doing those both.

03:41:35

I will see everyone later. Thank you. Thank you. That was super fun. Also, thank you so much for the people that submitted reviews. They've opened a group so far that i'm aware of, and they've gone through, uh, everyone's words, actually meant so much. I did not expect to get so many like, good reviews.

03:41:55

Right out the game. So it was definitely a brightening of my day yesterday and today. Okay, i'm leaving now because it's embarrassing. Bye. What would be a good fourth level besides bone shaker or shatter? Okay. So what this is where i get to be like, what's your? What's your thing?

03:42:20

What's what's? Oh right now. Okay, easier question. Five is the the average for a d8, right? For health. Yes. Yes.

03:42:37

Five is indeed the app. Uh, as for your thing, don't chatter is a great classic. Um, I guess.

03:43:11

I have answers for third and fifth but forces fourth is usually the spell slots that get turned into a bunch of mathematics. So, bye. Grayson. Oh, i could take shocking image. Yeah, i'm shocking images. Okay, it's a mirror image. It's okay.

03:43:43

Um actually actually i know what, i know what i'm going to say. I'm taking stone skin if you have the material too. Yeah, you're right.

03:44:00

Okay. Um off the top of my head, just going through going through my mental list of like good styles. Uh yep. Stone field. Skill of skin is on there. You don't need to care too much about a new cask because we have koya ignoring that then there is always win, the fight.

03:44:19

That is a spell uh black tentacles that went by. Um if you don't like if you want to deny an entire surface area and also make it extremely hard for your melody to be able to do anything. Like tentacles does the job. I mentioned doors are classic and just generally useful, you'll use it in combat out of combat for other things.

03:44:39

Blah, blah, blah. Nice to have. Um, i guess i could also do confusion. Yeah, confusions. Okay. Um if you focus on on mind effective such then it's it's way better but yeah, it's not bad. Uh if you care about your vocation particularly by lightning i think is it forth?

03:45:06

Um, lightning is really good. If not, not then, greater and disability. What's fun. Do you say was ball lightning? And if you don't care about that one, um, great or invisibility is also forth. Yeah, you're right. I might have to pick that one up. I'm not telling you to do that as the ninja, but i am telling you to do that as the ninja please.

03:45:31

Yes, i am one. I i i will actually have that when i gotta remove the spells that i was going to think. Uh, yeah, that's it. I keep forgetting on. Keep thinking it's station. If you can't learn about necromancy stuff. Yeah, bone shadows on there. I think nervation is also really good.

03:45:52

If something has just an abysmal touch, um, innovation is pretty good.

03:46:01

And i think that's about it. That's, yeah, because you're you're not a transmitter. So about that, it's all about the shape stuff. I can throw away. We're just getting a round places and through taran. Stone shape is useful. Uh,

03:46:28

Estoque us. I have thought about that.

03:46:37

Yeah i can't find innovation what the fuck. Third us.

03:46:48

Oh, and the original spavery systems or for innovation? Yeah. Enjoy state intro the real spell resistance. Yeah. Sorry. It, it lands triangularly. Stinking if they have just the bismol to Jesse about, you know, okay. So it's like okay i'm just gonna up the with up the caster level, get the fuck through this, all get yourself a piercing mathematic web.

03:47:16

Whenever we finally come into contact with civilization again, i just feel like, no, no, no. This will land make it so. Yeah. I think i think my personal takes from from the fault level casting because like i say i normally end up mathemagicang a lot of stuff total of like extensive stuff goes for me.

03:47:36

Um, definitely dimensional always ends up on every character i have, unless they've somehow gotten rid of contrition because of Thessalonian expert. If i do that, i cry. Um, i mean i definitely i don't need to mention. No. Really you don't? But the thing with the mentioned doors that you're supposed to use it on other people.

03:47:57

Oh, i mean i was gonna the other one. I was gonna when i when i can get it. I'm going to take uh, the fucking telekinetic charge telecom charges. Also, another gun challenge is also false, but the problem with telekinetic charges that it eats an immediate action, which isn't too bad usually.

03:48:18

But for this part you we use a lot of swifts. Yeah, yeah. Right? I use a lot of swifts. Oh, geezers quite a few of them in conjunction from another stuff. Um, a mako uses them player, not so much, but you don't want to be using that on her anyway.

03:48:36

I wouldn't use it. Yeah, we never know. You might look in a big charge to an opposite direction. Just telekinetic charge them into the wall, like just get out of that because it doesn't provoke uh, actually no. No it doesn't. It doesn't provoke while moving if i would call because you'd like telekinetically move them around the attack.

03:48:57

Um for defensive books at that level bracket, i don't think you can go wrong with shadow form. That's probably the one i would choose over shocking image. I shot a phone is just like, i'm just gonna reduce like all the damage that i take.

03:49:20

Um, it's pretty useful, you're right. It is. Um but then you have to make it will say well yeah you don't you're not actually a wizard so you don't scroll. So, contingent scroll is not something that you care about, but if you care to pick up scrolls and actually use them contingent, scroll is just nice to have uh, control fireball is also really, really funny, but it's funny to me more than like the normal viable because everyone's like, oh, you can do stuff for fireball.

03:49:51

It's cool. I have a character who's fireballs like, they're minimum damage. Still fucking incinerate. So i'm like, yeah, sorry you might want to do something about that, guys, at some point. I do want to pick up the intensified ones, or yeah. Yeah, intensifies. Another one, that usually ends up getting into the fourth level slot.

03:50:17

Um when i was using lightning bolts quite a lot, um on my iron god's character that is where like second, sorry. Now um third fourth and sick level slots basically just became lightning bolt variants. It's like here you go. Like well, i now have 15 hit points and that's you have hit points.

03:50:43

I should probably. So my, my question i have for me right now is how much do i value having another irritive attack? And i think the answer is, i jump.

03:51:02

I don't i took it not that i need it but just because we are doing elephant in the room and i'd rather take it now than feel like i'm losing a feet later. I'm going to retrain my weapon. Focus to get combat reflexes, and then pretty set for a while.

03:51:21

I agree though like that offhand. Iterative attack worthless. So for a long while well here's here's the thing, the amount of times i'm getting to be able to stand stale is completely like it's not a thing. Yeah, i like honestly, i can considered dropping to any weapon fighting and like just recently, i considered like, i wouldn't do it because i've already invested a lot of flavor into it as far as the ninja stuff, but i just love the key points and the flexibility of forgotten trick even though.

03:51:56

Oh, she's bad at it so far. Um but yeah because like the to be able to do the regular warrior poet stuff and just like fly and hit hard and not be attacked would be super bad for us. Yeah, it's because i'm rolling for hit die on this. Bitch, i don't know right now.

03:52:24

I was taking average. Yeah i think i think specifically with no way. I was like, no, no bitch you're gonna be in so many situations so they're just gonna fuck you up. It's not worth doing. Yeah, i don't know if that was just this one time, but your AC is like scares me.

03:52:41

Oh, no. My AC doesn't exist in neverhouse because i cannot wear armor. Oh yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Yep. So i built, i built a character for game. The party needed a cleric, right? I'm playing on clerk. For both the cleric of desna for what? Yeah, but for what campaign, it's fun, not for night.

03:53:14

It's for an in-person campaign clerk of doesnaz. Generally just are good. I also took a level of of investigator because we're the party is third level. Interesting choice. Okay, for what? I'm well for the characterized belt. I made really made dr. Isaac Kleiner from half-life. Oh okay. I check investigator and two levels of cleric.

03:53:52

And pretty much uh i took a i i took the travel domain and then i picked up a inquisition Which did you do? Do you? Are you doing like anyway? What was that? That you're doing like anyway which one that one type of investigator that gets a bunch of shit.

03:54:23

No, i just want to scattered standard investigator and i picked up the fucking stupid inquisite inquisition

03:54:39

You took an inquisition offer.net? Yeah, i didn't need the domain spells.

03:54:49

I remember which one it was. So sorry. I'm trying to. I'm trying to understand a thing. So your character is, are they like a standard cleric? We are standard clerk, okay? So you have one domain that gives you spells and the other one that is going to be the inquisition, right?

03:55:06

Yep. I took the uh, okay. That makes it. That makes it claim desk time i inquisition. Oh yeah, come with that sign together that. Yeah, yeah. So i go invisible. Yep, he pretty much causing combat uses that to do what he needs to heal. Somebody, he has a really good intelligence sport.

03:55:34

Because we rolled stats and we and yeah the character is very interesting. Okay, dude, do i go? Do i go? Ninja ninja, ninja. Oh, do i go stop? Stop. Stop. Or do i go? Maybe it will make poison work and i, no, i i can't really justify that laugh.

03:56:07

Poison is going to be so hard, dude. Like it's fantastic. If you can, it's the npc versus pc thing, right? Like it is the dichotomy, it's like when it's used but anime, it's a fucking travest day, but when it's used by you good, god, you need to invest so much shit.

03:56:22

Yeah. You're really do. Yeah. What are you talking? Okay, your ninja tricks. Are like are you talking about a multi-class? Because no, no no no no. I'm not multi-classing. Like what would no way? We'll take last night, paladin.

03:56:43

Oracle, actually, to be fair, i could i could see, but but no. Um, like a no evil. Yeah. Like antipalities actually, got probably makes sense. Um no. I think, i think i know what i'm gonna do because i i know what i'm taking as my my tenth level ninja trick and i, well, i said that level my, you know, yeah.

03:57:07

Whatever it is. 10th is night, the juicy. I know what you're all thinking. I know what you're all. Fucking thinking you're all thinking invisible blade. The answer is no. Not to visible before. You're picking up a like greater the the one they give you improved evasion. There's a few other one.
