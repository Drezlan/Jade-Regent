00:02

It's just you gotta pick and choose and all you need to do what i'm currently thinking about doing, which allows you to modify poisons. As long as you're the one who makes them and once you can start doing that and start messing with things like the primers and uh methods of delivery poisons.

00:22

Like, get cracked up as a whole three of things you can do so long as you're not fighting in bed. Basically. Oh, maybe i'll run to my old poison source rebuild that i wanted to make by you and see if you can make anything good out of it. Because i eventually abandoned it because i thought it was not worth it.

00:42

Sorcerer is hard simply because you're a caster and you have so many other things that you could be doing. Instead, i'm not saying that. Yeah, it was not good base. The base of the build was the fact that, uh, the, the resume are in archetype gets to create any, you can stop talking, you mentioned the resume next type to me?

01:00

And i'm my brand turns off because that thing is stronger. The game that is. Yeah. Uh, you can buy a scroll of miracle and then never have to pay for another miracle ever again. It. Yeah, because the way it works is that you cast from a scroll as if uh, you had to expended from your old spell slots.

01:24

So what that actually functionally means is that you can one purchase by a bunch of scrolls. And now that becomes your spelllist. So you almost adaptable have more spells and basically function like a was a except you just pull out of school and you cast from that instead of having to prep from your spellbook, it's kind of drunk.

01:50

Um, what's the scrollmaster should have been? Yes, and if you cast from the scroll, it explicitly says that you do not use the scroll. You just empower the like the use of the scroll using your spouse law, which means that if you have a scroll, that is three prepped with the amount of gold that you would need to, you know, use a restoration spell, not like that.

02:10

It does send you. It just say you spend the sorcerer spells thought that is, at least one level higher than a level or spell your trying to activate. Okay, it's not miracle man. But

02:24

Resurrection for free um all of those done. The like divine stalls that say you need to pay x amount of tribute for free. Um all about like yeah the reason it's like that is because it's a rasmir on archetype and because you are never going to leave like rasmina, which is a nice way to basically.

02:46

So please, this this class feature should not have left within. It's it's way too. Done little baby down there.

03:00

It's really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good. Um, for no good reason to the point where you know build outage of like Marshalls, don't get nice things. Um, that is in my opinion, just an offense to marsh, it's like, oh okay cool. So not only do like bottle clerics already have like a problem, just trying to be muscle like, anyway, and they have clericalists to support that.

03:31

Um, you now have it's also us who have access to your entire spell list. I don't have to pay additional costs after the first time. Like the only reason i wanted the archetype was just because it gets false focused for free and that was the core of the build.

03:49

That's like i guess i'll just take photos. Yeah just take also because that's how you do that. Yeah. Oh i see what you talk. You're thinking about doing you do false focus for like poisoning this guy? Oh yeah that's yep box expelter. Yeah, i mean so foreign not too bad.

04:06

That's good. I like that. That's neat. The rasmaron octetype makes me mad many things in this game. Make me laugh, but that one is good. It's like, yeah, because that's what they needed. But full walk-in cast this game needed a way to get the entire the violist for free.

04:23

Yeah. What tour was a recap? Not scary crafting. I'll shut up them.

04:43

I remember one thing now uh okay so where did we start last session? Uh, did we? I think we started just after we killed the the chimera, right?

04:59

Of the camera was first fight. Yeah, something happened before that. That happened during last session. Well, that was during this. Okay. Um, what happened before? The chimera, uh, we were like three travel tiles away from the city and the pass when i came in because i missed the previous session,

05:25

So we did like a bunch of our roles. We fought the chimera. There is a cool avalanche, um and that went pretty well. Greyson grace and the chimera. And then we came across pretty large camp of native peoples who invited us to come sit by their fire and uchi ate.

05:57

Some of the meat that they were grilling up which turned out to be a person. All right, right back. And then we thought all of them because that was no good. Um, and we just killed all of them. There's not really an authority to turn them into up here.

06:18

No reason to spare them. Um, we got a bunch of stuff out of them that i'm sure is here in the chat. I remember very little of it. And then we came upon ohanaimo. I want to say the the city that we are trying to get to to drop down onto the frozen lake.

06:35

Um, we met with somebody that was like, wolf's friend or like a leader of some sort, i can't remember her name, but she took us into her home and as we were meeting with her and getting a little bit of information about moving forward and what's been going on around here.

06:52

Um some kind of religious leader came up with the town's folk and said, oh, i should back up a little bit. The cult said that they've been having a really easy time of where they got all the meat from how they were doing so well, for themselves is because they were just going around and picking clean all of the devastation.

07:12

After the white dragon attacks have been going on all over the place. And then, i think we were talking about the storm that's been going on here in the north. It's blocking the way it was either the dragon or the storm that's causing problems for the natives. And this religious leader person was trying to say that we had something to do with it or that it was our fault that it was happening and trying to rile up all of the people in the settlement to, you know, give us a good old-fashioned, lynching or sticks and stones beating whatever their flavor is up here.

07:48

I think they were going for more ritual, sacrifice, sort of thing that was, they were going to sacrifice us. That's correct. I believe. Um, no way is the only one that could speak their language so howtoyuki. So i did like the first roll of that. Then we did a couple more diplomacy rolls of us, basically miming because we don't speak their language.

08:08

Like we mean you know harm not our faults um and so the people kind of be doing is best charades. Yeah, again, once again, that's happened before and they basically were like, i don't think this guy's, i don't think these guys are the problem. So, the town's folk or settlement settlers were they weren't game to kill us anymore and we went to go try and talk to the guy who had been trying to ride them.

08:38

We had to leave tomorrow. Yeah, they said me you got to get out of here but we went to we talked to the lady and said can we go talk to that guy? And uh, that's basically where we left off at the entrance to his temple carved into the side of the hill, or the mountain of the settlements on or something like that.

08:56

There was a lot of cool. Um stone buildings along with like non-stone buildings. And i think this was like a set into the terrain cave. If i remember correctly, it was a tunnel leading up to like a shrine or something. Yeah, and in the tunnel, we found a secret entrance to a secret tunnel that will lead us.

09:16

Uh and i forget the whole the song, but it'll lead us to where the to the to the guy hopefully. But yeah. So chimerified cannibals. Once again, the mention of the white dragon killing a bunch of stuff and then this guy trying to get everybody to kill us and everybody being like we're not going to kill you but you got to leave and then we were trying to talk to that guy.

09:39

What i miss?

09:44

Uh, i think at the end he mentioned that as we got into the tunnel, he said, grace and stone cunning, allow them to see a hidden passage. I think that's just choka was alluding to magnus was alluding to Because gracin has a 35 perception bonus.

10:10

Think Grayson has a higher perception than my mythic cleric. In the other game, who has like a 30, something wisdom.

10:28

He has a plus 25.

10:34

I think that's tied actually and that's because he has eyes are the equal and you don't

10:45

Great greats and skills in line. A nice cheap magic item that gives a great benefit for those focusing and perceptive. Yeah, i should pick that up on soccer.

11:11

No, we burnt video yet? Of course, not.

11:31

All right. Everyone got vision.

11:39

Yes. Yes, i do. Everything, the secret door is right here. Leading into a tunnel. This is the lips that goes up to the windsong shines.

12:00

So as we go past it and such christens like, um, because i think we've got that that other lady with us. Wait, it's like, okay. So if that's the lip that goes up, what is this thing? Go.

12:17

Wait, let me help you. Am i supposed to see more than just a bunch of gray squares?

12:28

Yes, i don't think i have any art on the map that i'm on.

12:38

No, i you're talking is right here. Yeah, i'm seeing it. Maybe i'll just reload, you know, easy said a lift and i see there's like no art. This looks very much like a blank grid canvas, but that's irrelevant one. I'm just going to reload and we'll move on with our lives.

12:57

And then we're gonna see the map uh, i can. Yeah, i'm just like ever the least complicated map. You're going to see today. So but there is stuff on it.

13:18

Oh yeah. See. Now, there's stuff that worked. Uh yeah. What is all and grayscale, though? Is that bright for low light vision.

13:32

Um following up with grace and said, yeah, so we came up from this other direction but now over here, right? Oh no, it's colored. Oh i went for that website. Yes, that is the way you came in. This is the lip that goes to the top up to like this temple or shrine.

13:54

Yeah. It's a little shrine and that's still wall just sort of slides open.

14:06

Where did she go?

14:17

Did we check the shrine just in case before we head down the scary secret tunnel? Yeah. I mean meta gaming. I think obviously if we try and go up there, there might be something going on in the guy ran down here. Um, but i feel like i'd be intruding if i just walked in and tried to find a secret door and walk down it without even finding the person that we were looking for.

14:43

Because we haven't talked to the guy yet, right? He ran off after uh he did the crown thing and then we just followed them in here. And what is this? This person's name again. This person, you are not met them yet. Oh, this is a different person. This isn't the one who received us at her house.

15:05

No, that would. That was son of and this person just followed us up and said, wait for me, wait for me. Yes. Uh, just ran up to you actually saying that. Greetings isn't this. The girl, who who came up to the the priest down and down in town, and told him that we, they didn't find the guy.

15:25

Like they were, they went up to the shrine. They couldn't find him. No, it's not his apprentice, okay.

15:36

Oh, how can we help you help you are you looking for to Newark? Yes, i saw him coming to this tunnel, but when i looked, they could not find him. I know he is doing bad things. I wish to help what bad things is he doing.

16:06

It always disappears right before the dragon attacks. Oh,

16:18

Nervous laughter.

16:22

And they have no way to prove. I can fight how old is this girl? Look 15 16. Um, and so when she I'll just goes when you say when you say he, you saw him go into this tunnel. Do you mean this door here that our friend found or just in this area in general in the shrine?

16:49

No. This i have never seen before he came through this tunnel, and she points over here.

16:59

But the lift had not left. Oh, like the lift is still down here right now, it hasn't gone up. Yes. So he couldn't have gone up there. It doesn't like come back down. Do what we know that. Okay, cool. Well, he could lower it back down from the top.

17:16

Yeah, no, we chased him up here. Pretty fast. All right, let's go. We're going into the secret room. Um. Are you sure? We should be bringing the girl with us. Yeah, she can go first. Just kidding chica follow along. She's seen stuff that we haven't seen. Am good. It's fight.

17:40

I mean, taking a look at her, does she look good at fights? Does she like, i mean, she pulls out her twin hand axes and swings them around. It looks pretty good. Yeah, i guess there's no real way. I would be able to tell whether someone that's like capable or not.

18:00

Uh it would also help to talk to the towns. People if something goes down and have a local witness that isn't all of us, people who just showed up, oh still go size. It says yeah, yeah, you're right on that one. I'm gonna tell you right now. She she is an area talking traveler.

18:18

She is a seventh level ranger. Okay, let's go friends. He can fight.

18:30

Oh, she runs. Naruto runs into this secret tunnel.

18:38

Did abby already go. I don't see noah anymore. She went and viz. Oh,

18:53

Happy. If you're you're talking we can't hear you figurative.

19:03

As we start moving in here, grease, and we'll take a second and we'll cast dark skin on himself using a key point.

19:15

Cocoa. I don't know if there's supposed to be a door here or something, but this is, as far as i'm getting pickleball, throw up a mirror image on himself. There we go. And you not see the stairs right here? No, there's no wall there. There's no vision through there.

19:41

There's no must be no light source. Oh yeah. There's a light. The, the outside tunnel is open to, to a light source. All right? So someone needs to get a torque shot. Oh, Yeah, i will, i can pop off a torch. I should have some, okay, i have lights.

20:05

Oh, you can use a lights, some sort of light spell. Yeah. Okay, i wish you wouldn't. Oh, the rest of us. Can't sit down here. Do you have any sort of way to give us a dark vision? Noah.

20:28

You've known me this long, perhaps sarcasm needs a little bit more time to kind of the rich itself and i'll shut up. You doing great. Just hang back. So, oh yeah. Why is the light not turning on probably because they haven't actually put a freaking radius then?

20:55

Yeah, i'm pretty sure the map is doing that weird thing again, where like tokens are just popping in and out and you can't see shit.

21:07

Really fucking wish. There we go. Bad.

21:15

Fluid spoopy in here. Come on choco. I can't see without you punched. I'm not planting okay.

21:31

Come along everybody. Stay tight.

21:39

This is uh, and together everyone up.

21:45

I am losing the light source off of showco, unless there's something going on here.

21:58

I have also lost the light source.

22:05

But while we're walking along soka will whisper to grace and um just is this the stonework? Look like something these folk could have done with their kind of tools. Like, oh, we're doing the aliens pyramids thing now. Right. Okay. Yeah.

22:31

Don't know, does it?

22:36

Uh, it's very good. Still don't work at least for a little while and then it sort of starts getting rough and uneven again.

22:48

Yeah, sugar. It, it seems pretty high quality but see that that area up ahead? It looks more. Just like someone went at it with a pickaxe.

23:05

And after quite a climb of stairs and right. Sloping tunnel. Well, actually, i guess i could ask our guide. Um, the girl who's coming along with us? Uh uh, did we get her name? I want to ask her, i did. I think that was the first thing i asked.

23:25

Oh, do you? Maybe that's, i didn't hear it. That's fair. What's your name girl? Nakoon, that's a cool name. I'm och. This is a mako koya. Showco. Grayson hutsuyuki. That's monkey. If monkeys here is monkey here way and should be here. Yes, dig out this place. Spiritually zeo is with us as well.

23:54

I do not know. I never saw the tunnel.

24:04

We on the go up to the windsong shrine.

24:10

Yeah, i suppose you'd have no wave, no one.

24:17

If at some point, i'm back on the map. Feel free to just throw me anywhere. You are on the map. You're on this map. Invisible invisible in a way where i can somehow still see you.

24:35

Definitely not the case. Um, i can't seem to see her either. No way about now you guys my now i hear want to get up here. I'm more concerned about Abby seeing her.

24:58

It's fun. Well, i was gonna say that. Like he just went north again. Yeah, because i put a visibility. Oh, okay, i have control about. All right. Um, i was gonna say, like you won't even be able to point to how do you give? Because she she went invisible.

25:15

The moment we went down that turn along. Got in deep white. No, i was just rattling off everybody's names. I didn't think what he got to you. He would have just vaguely pointed in a direction around the other people. Well, because if you're, i swear, not crazy, we made it to the secret tunnel entrance before you went invisible and she was running up on us.

25:36

So i mean, unless you were already rolling stealth against her perceiving you in the first place. No, well, there was a lot of bodies in the way. I i hear you it's feasible but i rattle off an extra name so yeah, no i i'm with you. I'm just for my mental image of policies of my sound a little down at the moment.

25:56

My caffeine hasn't kicked in. Um, gotta get that breakfast. Juice breakfast late. Evening approaching morning. Um all day every day juice. Actually, you know what, no you you guys continue as you're on no way. It's probably just gonna stay around the new post and for when they inevitably stop us in the back, that's not smart.

26:20

That's i'm glad you did doing that because the last time, like anyone left, i makeo even remotely on garbage, she got fucking abducted. So we're not doing that again because ahead of you. Yeah, i know because i didn't have control of my token. For now i'll shooko has to say somewhat in front because he's our he's our light source, so delight there's light down here.

26:46

Now you just come look. Can you see you? Paused it. So i assume you want to be to stop sands but uh, yes. Yeah. To stop pause anymore. So you can move up the space if you'd like to see shoko, i can see it's Emily lived by daylight from the crack in the ceiling, high above the slushy basin at the bottom of the ramp.

27:10

That's what you meant. Yes so you guys are now descending down a ramp like it arched up out of the mountainside and then started going down into a slushy basin. This lets you bring since the bottom of the ramp is filled with hundreds of bones, all marked with a curious room, like a fast, frost rimmed three fingered skeletal hands to the south dozens of skulls have been piled into a crude altar painted along the icy walls of the pit are irritucky, pictograms.

27:48

Scattered among many more of the strange rooms. Uh, knowledge planes or religion means

28:30

Trained for you.

28:48

Loco. You immediately recognize the three fingered hand is the symbol of syphilid the nascent demon, lord of blizzards and the frozen dead. One of the pictograms along the walls. Shows strange black standing stones rising from icy hills. Well, another display is a cluster of towers glowing with strange blue light.

29:10

The third shows a single monolithic tower rising above what seems to be a black lake with white mountain peaks behind it. A fourth pictogram, depicts, a spiraling storm with long arms, ending and ice fang. Jaws devouring aritake villages but with longer jaw arms reaching towards forest crudely john castles and cities and what may be ships at sea warriors have shown trying to fight the storm with spears before being engulfed and sealed.

29:40

In tombs of ice, the final pictogram shows, a blue skinned woman with dark wings and hair wearing a silver crown or circle. It her hands grasps, one of the claw symbols like a sceptor and spiraling streaks of silver and white curl from it in every direction.

30:02

The hungry storm.

30:08

And there are its first victims.

30:20

All right, so you're behind this then.

30:30

All i do is in service to her.

30:42

The demon lady maybe. Oh is it is it a female nation demon? Lord, no. The winged woman and the pictures is,

30:59

Yeah, i thought they were like master. Sure. Riddling. Male from my remembrance. Yes, this is male. Just okay, so do i recognize like what the pictures might be depicting? Specifically, like, does any of this imagery conjure force? Like knowledge of any sort of prophecies or stories or no. The black stones are probably the black monoliths that have been rising up though.

31:39

Yeah, but so there's two figures in what we're encountering here, sithid the demon lord of cold and blizzards and then there's this crowned lady in the pictures. Also, does he get anything for that? Or did we get anything for that from the knowledge roles? No, not for the crowdly.

31:57

Okay.

32:02

I will give you a very difficult knowledge geography, though. Where the other pictogram? I don't have it.

32:19

Yep, you cannot say you are familiar with really much of any of this. Haven't spent a lot of time in the crown of the world.

32:32

Everyone.

32:39

So why are we to be its first victims?

32:45

Be demands it. How long have you been killing folks? Your own people.

32:55

Let's see you're up. He is not going to respond to me further. He only wants to kill you. That's fine. Okay. Is there a height difference here at the blue line? Yes, you are. 60 feet above him and that is a sure drop going down. The rocks is your best bet because they continue to slope downwards, okay?

33:16

So like these areas, they actually grade downwards to the lower area. Yeah, acting as like stairs or green. They are difficult to rain. Okay, interesting. Interesting. Can somebody give me a TLDR on acrobatics to absorb dropping? 60 feet? Can't you like if it's a purposeful jump, soften the blow somewhat.

33:42

What do you lose like the first 10 feet? Losing the first 10 feet of it? Yeah, real quick. Uh, so from where you currently are you are 60 feet above him.

33:57

Getting to here you'll only be 30 feet above him, okay? But it was i wrong and saying that you can take 10 feet off of the distance for you're not wrong at all. No. Okay. But if you take any damage from falling damage, you're i'm automatically prone unless you have something like the bits of casket is true.

34:15

It's the cat. Okay, difficult. Terrain is half speed essentially. Boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Let's bust out a ruler. Oh god, how do we do the measure one again? You like press control and click during or i forget how this works.

34:43

Well, basically it's getting here, you'll be at normal speed. Yeah, i will just we'll figure it out. This is what we're gonna do. We gonna spend a key point and zoom and then probably double move. I think it's what's going to happen here.

35:08

So there's our key point.

35:13

Uh, so i have 70 in one move, right? Because mine is 50. Plus the 20 additional feet. So i'm gonna go to say there to start with that'll be 40 out of what like 140.

35:35

Oops.

35:41

And then we're getting into difficult terrain territory. So every square is 10 feet. So that's another

35:56

And now i'm on a level playing with him. Do i have to climb up any more difficult terrain or obstacle to get up onto this altar thingy? Nope. But you do need to make me an acrobatics check that you are unlikely to fail, but you still need to make it.

36:17

For everything is slick with ice and slurry. Okay. Well, how's the 33? It's good. You're fine. Like i said, you're unlikely to faitland. Uh so that was 80 so far. I'm sure i have plenty to get right up in this guy's john. I'll go there that the path you're taking.

36:40

Uh, does he have any weapons out?

36:48

The, the continued through the ice wall is very meme and i wish it were true. I run into a thing. You run into a thing.

37:07

That i don't think hits you i but your movement does stop there. That's i don't like that. Let's find i guess. Um and i will have drawn my weapons as part of that giant amount of movement, i think that's going to cover it for me. Let's stick together. It says the sunrise and runs in guns blazing.

37:34

I appreciate attention to the bit.

37:43

Oh, it wasn't me next. This, in fact, it was born to be. And i don't think any of you. Oh, no. Shoko. You saw a whore cross spirit, come crawling out of this cave right here and charging across the snows snarling uh incoming. And they'll point it out.

38:15

How does chocos? See? No, you shouldn't have seen that. Yeah. Uh, or something. Instead, i'm put invisible walls there. Buck my wife.

38:34

Triple gets about this far. Uh, and then season calls it out. Yeah, now i see it. Uh, and then he will begin his bardic performance, the walls of the cavern, shake with the sound of drums. Inspire courage. Yes.

39:08

It is on make those go.

39:25

I'm up over here. More around the corner growth and no three.

39:37

Um, more of the bones. Stand up and step towards ochi he can do to high five him. Yes, the high five again, grace in uh, Chris. It's gonna.

40:04

Uh, that would be a double move. So he slides to a stop, not quite at the edge but like a few steps back and he kind of stops and catches his breath and starts surveying the the battlefield for for where to lay down fire in a minute. Well, your practice, i immediately tells you that the whirling wind around the the shaman will likely make getting range attacks through to him difficult.

40:39

The lane gives them a 50%, miss chance on all range sex. Okay, because their shaman is an Oracle apparently.

40:54

The days before we had shamans, they were oracles. Yeah.

41:10

Way, and you should be up here. Since you were with me, go.

41:19

All right. Really unfortunate like koya hasn't gone yet.

41:35

Might even is choir on the the initiative, not roll her initiative.

41:49

About right? Yeah yeah. It didn't really help good old cleric initiative. Good old clerk initiative. Um,

42:03

And,

42:12

You have been fighting when is not popping up.

42:33

Is minus 5 from that again.

42:42

Uh,

42:54

And she targeted herself. So,

43:01

Where is slap? Put in. So the second one will also hit, i was being sarcastic, but go off, i guess. Yeah, so she having no idea that no is standing right next to her, uh, pulls out here, double eye hatchets and slams two hits in sequoia and then possibly a third, no way.

43:31

Succeeded on her knowledge. Meta gaming role. We get when we have no one in the party with sense motive, i'm pretty sure grace since motive is out of the ass due, to virtue of being, you know, wisdom. Uh, i was going to say something. Now, we're just letting oh cheese.

43:56

Terrible. Uh people sense and you're you're our main judge of character. You need to speak up when somebody asks to travel with us. Just i just like but my no one even look at the young airtaki girl sideways. I'm just saying you had literally just suspicious is the person who went invisible immediately really now.

44:21

Oh gee. Just always trusts everyone and i don't. So we can't answer these further out. He does.

44:33

Don't forget to spare her.

44:40

Considering. Yes, it actually gonna be. Oh, okay. Or maybe she didn't happen with the trade, who knows?

44:56

I'm not even gonna do.

45:03

Quick look. All i'm gonna say is that uh, she bleeds out, not my problem. Yo, other than confirm that's going to be a rake. Like she must have been lying about her age because i remember like the pathfinder rules. Have like uh, ignore them. Ignore them for ages. We have the iconic can access just ignore them and another horserouth spirit comes crawling out of that cave.

45:52

And so are these like sort of whisp looking things are these animating, the bones from the altar? What do they can? We see an art that is wind surrounding him. Yeah i mean i'll go pizz. Art.

46:17

Right. I remember him i was more specifically asking about the whore frost spirits. Like what are they and what are they look like? Oh, i'll just zoom in really far. How about that? That's what i should have done. They're scary looking. Yeah. Okay. So, these like the animated like ice and bones and some cold.

46:43

Yeah, they are very strange. They are definitely caporeal, but they are not well describes that way. Since they'll call them spirits, i did the predator undead with the heat sense,

47:01

Which we're in this book before Noah was here. So it's not my fault boats. It's fine. I get to full attack. Someone ham. Oh. Now that i'm zoo. There's fish on the ground. That's rad, i just noticed that as well. I am not at my normal computer, so these maps are not my work.

47:25

There's a nice troll in the initiative. Yeah, there is a nice trolling. The initiative. We'll get to you. All right. 17 and 20 to hit ochi really hard fight. I think those both miss. Welcome to the mid boss fight of the book. Well, amen. Boss fight of the book.

47:47

No way. And my boss fight, you say well uh first action. Well, one second is there a flanking bonus in there for that? Young horsefly spirit because the second be, it's yeah, you put it in. Okay, i did. Okay, all good. Moving on, that's fine. They are. It's no directly next decora seems to, it's definitely get like real crimson for some reason.

48:26

Hmm.

48:31

Where is that button? Don't drink the red snow kids.

48:40

First attack.

48:46

Just two unless this individual can see invisible targets uh no. If i don't think so pretty positive. So, you may continue. Okay.

49:08

Come in hand. Yeah. Going to remember where i put this button.

49:22

We're not even gonna buy the power attacking hit some buttons and see what happens.

49:32

Of course, i'm realistic. Why would I not realistic?

49:39

Why would i why would i not do that?

49:45

So invisibility pops off, which means i'll use that bonus. But the other attack comes in. I mean, yeah, hitter do i your flat footed? 14. Oh, that's unfortunate. Yeah, i'm so used to things just like having AC at the house to me, mixing at this point the last few days have been real rough.

50:10

I'm sorry.

50:14

Oh, i'm sorry. Um, all right. Well that's unfortunate is very unfortunate that's for bleed damage. Yep. Yep, i did two request. She did you plants if your second. Okay. That was that was my question. It just wasn't leaving my face in your second, uh, for long as the bleed possessed.

50:49

The hot thing. So that was the forget that this is the second. I'm assuming you're not only.

51:05

Is not only no.

51:11

So you take a two other large chunks out. Let's say very offended know it appears out of invisibility and just gouges out of the small child and she encroaches in and an erotica just says, but is incredibly offensive

51:34

Do not hurt this one and the entranton, if i ever need to get you guys to do something, all i'm gonna do is put McCoy and danger. Well, it was either that line or that's my job, which i don't know how self-deprecating, i don't know. You might see a lot of yourself in this young woman.

51:59

Yeah that's probably why. By the the big guns came out do welding murder minion still living motor menu. Um, from the same area. I've got a hunger in my tongue.

52:23

They've got an ice troll.

52:29

Oh shit. They kind of lumbers around the corner and let's lose a bellow. This is a lot of little guys. We sure could have used our arcanist for this fight. The darkness was supposed to be here for this fight. That's why we stopped a little early last time. Do we see?

52:52

Can i see the troll from here? I know i said it but i don't know that i can. Oh, you should not be able to see it from there. Which means i still have not gotten wall heights, right? Yeah, i think they were all invisible as what you were saying.

53:06

It looks like you've only built the walls of the left side of the front, half of this cave. Okay, i was also working on a brand new machine and last night, i just wanted to know if i should know, because if i could roll and knowledge on it or not, yet, that's all no.

53:23

My, my hard drive, with all of my game stuff on it, uh, died on wednesday. So, i had to go and get a new laptop for both work and running games while i'm on the road. Uh, so it's brand new machine with none of my art on it, which is all waiting back home on my tower.

53:43

RIP can't live. Any, please turn.

53:50

Um, excuse me. Love.

54:00

Boo. Boo expression and say like out of the way. I've got an ochy to heal. I don't think she has an OTD heel yet. Yeah, he hasn't taken any damage. I mean, i realized now this thing is wielding one hand. Axes and gets multiple attacks. I'm expecting you to treat me in the face.

54:25

No, don't don't put that evil on me. I don't want to she's not gonna fight you. She gives up she lays down.

54:39

The man, vanishes.

54:47

But not and thrilling things apparently.

54:59

I was gonna say the aoe effect around him. Probably makes some fairly easy to track no matter where he goes. No there's a lot of wind in the tunnel. You, you can't crack wind like that. You, you are exposed to the high north.

55:43

He went black.

56:27

Okay, top of the round.

56:45

Oh, single attack. Misses. Oh gee. Oh gee. Regrets running down here as a full round action, probably just full of regret.

57:04

Stab, i'm gonna stab.

57:16

Give me a room and working on my entirely too much stuff on it. Character sheet. I can't read. I need glasses. I'm gonna use a lot of key points to try and take out a couple of these right now, we're going to full attack. Can i split up the attacks between two of them, right?

57:42

Can i like swing it on any other one? I'll go attack number one. Attack was, if i kill one, we'll move on from one. That's what we'll do. Yeah. I don't know why i'm making it so complicated. Okay, okay.

58:12

This horrible.

58:16

The first one hits.

58:26

That's the offhand. Oh and that should have a kamikaze on it. Also, i'm sorry i didn't click it. Don't forget to take your recoil. I will roll it right after to that. Well, is that what the extra 2d6 was from?

58:46

Pardon on the yes, it's from your kamikaze. Yes. Um so but that other one is the off-and attack and i did not roll it for that one which sorry. Which one. So, the main, their, their labeled main hand in the main hand, iterative, i don't know. Which it spirit.

59:11

Did you attack? I've seen your target, flip around a couple of times. I just ended up doing them all on that one, so both attacks. So, i need to roll the d6s for the offhand attack.

59:29

So that's the extra damage on the offhand to this character. And then i'll roll my. What is that? 1d6 per swing that i did 26 plus successful strike. So, just two

59:46

Jesus. Yeah.

59:56

The the recoil did not favor. You? No, it really did not the recoil god's left in my face. And i didn't even kill one of these spirits. That was incredible. You almost killed one. If your second hit, you would have. Yeah. That was a five, not a great role.

01:00:19

Okay, that's my turn.

01:00:23

All across spirit.

01:00:40

You can't don't want to do it though. He did. So that's his turn choco Otherwise, you got to do it like that. Uh,

01:01:02

Um, so this is, this isn't a water. This is ground. Here it the snow slurry it goes another 30 feet down but i'm saying can i stand here? It's the clip edge. No there's a 30 foot height difference right there. This is 30 feet higher than this.

01:01:27

All right then, um, i guess i'm gonna go

01:01:37

This is a very piezo fight.

01:01:43

Just a bit. I mean, the, the trial needs to get involved. Then I'll consider it like truly piezo. All the dragon could just come in that it says i'm colliding with a wall. Where are you trying to go to here? It's lighting with a terrain wall.

01:02:07

Oh, that's that's an because you are balancing with half your square being split by this clickface drop. Okay, i'm trying to get to that square. So that's that's good. Okay, and then i will attempt to cast defensively.

01:02:29

A second level spell. So that's uh, that beats the DC for a second most. Well yeah, it's 15 plus the spell level times two, correct? Okay. Then these guys will all make me a save against. Is this the correct one? I don't want to click the wrong one again.

01:02:47

Oh yes, it is a 30 foot cone. Blasted out to my left here.

01:03:01

Um the dc actually isn't one thing. I i make a check so i will go over and i don't think that's gonna work. Is it? Where are you? Trying to cast it. Dodgeball. Sorry, you guys are playing a more advanced game of pathfinder than i am and thanks to dirchbard and sentiment intimidate check.

01:03:24

I get to make a performance percussion check.

01:03:30

Really handle them drums. So that does that beat the dc? To demoralize them. Oh, it does.

01:03:46

Then i demoralize these three undead and that will be my turn.

01:04:01

I'm missing something. I don't see it. The moralized just shaken, right? Yep.

01:04:13

Why use an unnecessary extra word, then Wow, i i just think the moralize actually meaning the shaking. Condition is unnecessary in that spell because the act of the moralizing has so many different rider. Things. That's saying you make a target shaken would also mean anything that you wanted to trigger but wasn't uh specifically using intimidate would trigger on things.

01:04:46

Like somebody casting fear or uh okay it's it's one of the, the social system things here. Exactly. I've never done one of those builds before or had one done. So, this is new for me or froth spirit. He's almost dead gonna have his death battle at OG.

01:05:15

No, he's not to miss and to miss racing.

01:05:24

Uh, i don't know how long they stay to moralized. Well depends on how far you beat the DC trip. Uh yeah, for every five you exceed the dc, the round is increased by one. Okay, so the 10 plus half your head dies, plus your wisdom, modify. Thank you. Uh, well.

01:05:52

So i'm around down 14, so you beat it by 21. So four rounds, there you go. Well, if you beat it that's one round already. So, every five past that is, so it's five rounds.

01:06:17

Sure. No, if they're not bed and five rounds though, something is wrong. Okay, it's in. Okay. Something's going to take do a full. His first arrow will be the one that ochi almost killed just to at least try to stop the flanking bonus down there and then the rest will be at the base roll.

01:06:57

The first zero hits. Exactly. Grayson, you almost miss man. What's up?

01:07:08

Something fun. And you one round, the extra control dead faster than i was expecting. Okay, only has 45 hp. You see r4? Well, damn, the question is how many times doesn't get up? Not that i would, what we'll see. We'll see. Uh, it doesn't because he did ask advantage.

01:07:34

Oh shit. Yeah. And then you guys perfect step and that's his turn. I mean, it's also only has a constitution of 16 and is that negative 17 instead? Rip, thank you. Continuous horrifying. Um, the young girl with her hatchets dripping in blood starts, hackling, madly and other worldly down and does Folding swing at you.

01:08:13

For the two open fighting minus two.

01:08:21

There's a box.

01:08:28

Yep. You hit once. I don't wear all my remember that's fair. And yes, the energy coming off of her hand. Axes now is disgusting and makes everyone around her uncomfortable. Just absolutely rancid vibes. Uh, it's profane demonic energy. So yeah, it's pretty bad. Uh, gross. I hate it. Thanks, i think.

01:09:07

Motorizing.

01:09:18

I no wonderfully.

01:09:29

These guys have a pretty low to hit with shaken omega. Should be able to handle these guys.

01:09:39

First action, vanishing trick immediately jump out of the punishment traction, frying clock you i forgot to give verbally damage Yep, real unfortunate of that.

01:10:01

Who cares anymore?

01:10:09

I think she cares fitting on the face. Probably 15. Boom, a 1519 hitter.

01:10:27

It hits her. You vanishing kicked? I just

01:10:40

Cool. She did unfortunate for you. She dead dead.

01:10:56

I guess with the rest of my movement now that i have that back and this bursts out of her as she falls to the floor. Dead cackling with the lighted glee. Oh, we can't. We can't see that from here. So. Oh, that's nasty. It is, it's gonna get fly swatted.

01:11:24

Anything girl kelvin and it's a girl fuck. Uh, cannot yours. So, taking aback by what is just happened.

01:11:43

Yep. Not consider version, uh, death roll.

01:11:55

Something happened. Some spelled, yes.

01:12:03

And how's the good and travel domains?

01:12:19

She's gonna focus on what she can do then.

01:12:25

Which is moo really fucking fast.

01:12:48

No, poetry. You're in that one more forward.

01:13:20

I don't like this really charges headboard. Jesus fucking christmas. Oh yeah, you outright killed her.

01:13:31

Five, five, six, six, six. Yep. It was a lot of damage.

01:13:44

That you actually have Oracle casting than a rich.

01:14:19

On the animations might be in the ass.

01:14:41

Okay. You hear the sound of blades as a ghostly apparition bombs next to you,

01:15:02

Oh,

01:15:20

And then, this is certain

01:15:46

And these Horcross spirits really fell off in the threatening list. Oh, gee

01:15:55

Okay, so there's a ghostie boy right next to me. Now, that is correct.

01:16:15

Oh, she's gonna fight the step this way and then gonna do a bunch of stab.

01:16:42

Well.

01:16:47

Your second attack shatters, the horse frost spirit.

01:16:56

Okay, and then i need to roll some hurt on myself again. My floor. Oh, wow. Oh, that's unfortunate for you buddy. That's fine. Everything's fine and that's going to be my turn.

01:17:27

You just undo what i did. I'm doing my best, a late all out.

01:17:46

It cost three key points to do this koya. I'm not turning it off. Also, you can't.

01:17:58

You can end it. No, you can't. Oh, you can spend, you can spend one two dismiss it. Why would i know how to do that? That's fair. You'll go. So, what the hell did the the old man? Go like he disappeared. And what what did he do with his turn?

01:18:19

That's where this ghosty boy came from. So, i'm about 100% certain. I am not going to bother casting defensively because i don't think this this sore prosperity can hurt me right now. Uh, so i will invoke the attack and i will cast mortal terror on the ghosty, boy.

01:18:47

Nothing happens. Oh well, there goes. That smells look. So it's not an undead. It is not.

01:19:03

All right, that's my turn. I do get the a-op still from the the horse watching crit. Okay. I guess i will actually check. Can i make a skill? Check to see what the thing is. Those arcana.

01:19:39

You are a damn sure. Now that is a spiritual ally. Not a ghost. They being composed of force. And you can't really do anything to them.

01:20:00

Would you describe that as supernatural? I would describe it as an evocation force spell, okay?

01:20:15

Arcane constructive force in the shape of an ally. Inflammation. Yes. Shoko. Just saw like spectral energy and assumed ghost without actually thinking both the fair assumption. I just i get that. Um my cavalier level or half my cavalier. Level bonus for uh my knowledge, arcana and knowledge, whatever. The other one is planes.

01:20:54

If it's supernatural, if you deem it to be supernatural uh it is definitely supernatural. So you may roll. Knowledge are kind of. Oh, wait until you're changing it. I am. That's what the the order gave me arcana and planes.

01:21:19

Racing.

01:21:25

Um, i'm gonna start wiring at the refresh spirits.

01:21:51

Second arrow. Drop them moving up. The line are going, welcome to the, to the end, to the unshakened one.

01:22:14

He explodes.

01:22:22

And i just put like damage on anyone.

01:22:33

No, not me. All righty. Anything else sugason, um, he will kind of back up a five foot step and like looking down the tunnel. There's like, there's no way we really need her to help find this invisible guy. Yeah, i was gonna say i don't think the thing that popped out of the girl joined initiative the closet.

01:22:59

That's fair. It should join.

01:23:18

Hello core prospered. Gonna keep trying his best. Oh my

01:23:33

Either of them are actually grits. Oh wow. That scared me. A little who's that targeting?

01:23:49

This keeps happening.

01:23:54

I, i guess it's paladins, man. Which is awful because i love paladins.

01:24:09

He squawks another happy cackle at a job. Well done and being a closet fucks off. No way. I do. You have spellcraft? No, i have no. You acknowledge the planes.

01:24:35

I'm fine closet. They can't teleport. Oh, fucking know that. I know. I know the closet is not what you need to be worried about that. I know invisible thing is going visible and i just said, greyson say something about was having invisible problems and you hear from down the tunnel.

01:24:54

I'm fucking work or not it. And at that as one reaction uh, pulls out a potion from her. Harry uncorks it. And, uh, chug's real fucking hard and uses one of her elixirs of spirit site. Yeah. So, uh, i get push my scene invisibility button so happy, they made that button work.

01:25:32

I still got to say anything visible, but uh, i'll take it word for it. Almost. There's a specific thing for it. That's not activating. Oh, looks like well i just joined us. Oh fuck. I accidentally deleted a token.

01:25:50

Hey rye. How's it going buddy? Uh, tired. My i have zonked out a couple hours ago. I set my alarm for that and apparently you know, armed and go up weird. Why can't you see it? You basically don't recap. We went down the tunnel and we found the old man attempted form.

01:26:19

Some kind of magic down here on this computer platform. Let me, let me try this. He summoned a bunch of ghoulies to attack us and went visible and were dealing with that right now. Uh, i can't see, no way it might be a height thing for me being down in the pit.

01:26:39

So i don't think she'd be able to see him if he's still down in this area. Regardless. Oh, where we're looking at the the closet right now. Oh, for sure. You know, i can't you can no let me uh, okay. Let me let me fix this. I know what's happening.

01:26:58

If it could just save this thing. Try that. There we go. We got it. It just wasn't saving the singing. Visibility on census correctly.

01:27:15

Um yeah he still just sort of floating there in the air and he would be watched you puzzled as he pulled the potion away from your lips and then you see him and he goes back. Yep.

01:27:34

So, uh,

01:27:38

I'm i'm going to momentarily do the the ninja thing and assume that you do not have a good enough acrobatics to stop me if i try and do this.

01:27:55

Um, let's see. His cmd is 12. Which what's your acrobatic? No, you could take a one an acromatic asset. So we're not going to roll this and i'm going to say that uh you've blocked this escape routes. No, i just like drinks. This thing smashes the the thing and before the glass hits the ground, she's already on the other side.

01:28:24

Just looking at this thing. Like that is unfortunately my entire time, as i did have to use uh, some slips to, to get things out. So we are all right, boom.

01:29:04

And again, seriously, cool right now. So she's just gonna throw her star knife. So does a zero join us at like top around or something? I will have him roles initiative. Once we're done here,

01:29:38

Things like awful lot of damage there quick. Oh, of course it is your christmas score when it's plus five and you have deadly in.

01:29:51

You belong of. No should be level seven. Oh, okay.

01:30:04

Never quit for coyote says, she got a headband.

01:30:14

So, our such bullshit.

01:30:25

Fishing charges. Why do you keep resetting his casting stat to intelligence?

01:30:37

Charisma.

01:31:24

You know, the the shitty thing about spiritual allies, Their attack rolls and they provide blinking, unlike spiritual weapons.

01:31:47

So there's that for you. I think the 18 misses

01:31:55

And abby target ago. So you think it's to see the cool effect from their attacks that i made.

01:32:04

Oh, there's two invisible, boys. Or spiritual boys? Yes. Another one just appeared in this square right here. Yes, they did. That second attack will actually hit or four points of force damage.

01:32:29

Yeah, just murdered someone.

01:32:37

Or crossfire dead. Oh g. Okay. Can i roll a knowledge on these friends and circling me, that was the knowledge Icona from earlier. Okay, i will roll one because i did not. Oh, or maybe i did. I thought that was actually remember you making the role. Now, i remember telling you you can make a knowledge or accountant role and then not getting a rule.

01:33:09

Yeah, i was waiting for my turn because i had rolled one earlier. Um, on what tuna walk was doing or the skeletons. I think the whole frost spirits. Yeah, i roll the planes check for a 12 previously.

01:33:28

Oh, beautiful. So a nine if it's supernatural.

01:33:38

So i know nothing. Uh, no, you don't. And that's okay, you know, nothing. Okay. Oh yeah. Cracking out the vintage rings. On this one birds. No, i don't think vintage means what you think it means those from like the earlier seasons when they like back in like 2012 2013, whenever that was something fun even an antique until it's at least 25 years old the internet years and the internet and years are dog years.

01:34:15

He's got there's this is a gray area but i will say it was season two. So probably 2012 2013 because i've been rewatching it. Um i'm gonna cry. I don't me knowing i probably won't be able to hit these, but i'll take a swing, we'll swing a bunch. That's what we'll do.

01:34:37

We'll do another step in some swings.

01:34:42

Yeah. Nothing happens to them, okay? Then i won't even bother rolling. I'll just pretend i did. Um and then i think that's going to be it for me then so he steps back. Does a couple swings and just swings through him and nothing happens.

01:35:08

This is a scary fight. Um, for across here. Understand shoko, i could use some help down here. My weapons are working. Stop bar. Stop trying. They don't you can't hurt those things. Uh, shoka will attempt to acrobatics past this guy.

01:35:38

Uh, to get around behind him for flanking. Uh, let me do. I have the planking buff. No, i do not. I need to add that real quick.

01:35:52

Uh, and then whack him with my wave blade.

01:36:00

All right. You success. Barely. Oh, i assuming will shake them. That would be super easy. Oh. Okay, no, it's that you're acrobatics thing along Frozen rocks. Oh, oh, that's a 17 hit. So probably a miss uh nope there he is. 17. Oh, okay.

01:36:35

Okay. So 10 damage and end turn.

01:36:44

I click the peaches browser. Give me a second.

01:36:56

You never click the features browser in combat. Is dead manco.

01:37:18

Oh shit, where's the double around? Uh, zero you're here. Uh, okay, rolling. Oh wait, where's my token? Uh, and grabbing you. But you over here with Amico, are with no, a

01:37:46

Okay.

01:37:52

Let's go and do a turn for you.

01:38:02

So apparently i i just got here i had no idea what's going on.

01:38:11

I guess so i guess you just lied behind a bit. Uh i don't know what you see down there, but once you get up here, i can describe it. But better for you. You cannot move through that fish. You are currently enjoying besides of no way covered in a lot of blood, you're not sure how much of it is hers and how much of it belongs to the completely eviscerated, body of a small child.

01:38:41

The juicy directly in front of her, a teenage girl. So there's a small small child dead on the ground, but you cannot move through this space.

01:38:58

Okay. Who's in the child and what's going on? He real dead, she didn't have 36.

01:39:15

Get busy and see you in six seconds.

01:39:23

And i think it's just been a new, i completely new day. Same day since you talked with the headmistress. Yeah, same day we left off right? When you were going into the mountain, okay? I thought the last thing i remember was we, we heard of a town where you met with the head mistress of the eritage village and then the village shaman proclaimed.

01:39:54

You guys terrible omens and tried to rally the group too, sacrifice. One of you. Oh yeah. Okay. And then we followed him into the mountain. Got it. Small flighty and visible thing directly ahead of you don't stand there unless you want to get out of. No. Shank or eaten.

01:40:14

I'm all the fuck this thing does.

01:40:19

Oh, okay.

01:40:29

Oh, i will go ahead and i'm really kept yourself.

01:40:38

I'm gonna cast memory, man.

01:40:43

Very good. Oh sure. I still have my mirror image up. I haven't been hit once and we will go back to amigo.

01:41:13

No, i'm self roll.

01:41:25

And starts slowly looking around the room or from crease in.

01:41:37

Person. We walked over here and just look around seen. As ochi found that attacking those things was useless. He's just trying to perceive for any signs of the guy.

01:41:55

Well, roaming perception. Actually, you can probably do that. Okay. Now, we will roll his, because the situational bonus. You actually have a really good chance of noticing him with that and you do. I the wind is moving across friction directions over here all centered on this square. This little try taking one just shot at the square.

01:42:34

Knowing it's not likely, he'll hit, but he'll i'll just give it a shot.

01:42:45

Confirm. All right. Uh, this is silly. So he only gets concealment once, right? From the invisibility. But then then into the air barrier. Yeah. It sounded like the air barrier with a separate thing. So, like a separate roll. Yeah. Okay, so higher low on the invisibility. Hi. Higher low on the wings barrier uh low.

01:43:23

Ah, uh, but he will say, he says back over the next by that torture, not torture crystal thing over there.

01:43:35

Back christmas thing over there and there's like seven of them. I want to see where he shot the arrow. You know.

01:43:48

Uh, nakun is gone.

01:44:02

Withdraw.

01:44:09

Withdraws. 10 feet and 10 feet withdraw is five footstep plus twice. Your movement in speed what you provoke for the rest of the movement. Excellent. Boom. So my my view boogered off again. So i'm assuming it fled further in uh, it fled into the opening of the cave and then straight up got you, heck and cheese making his way out of the, the crevasse.

01:44:46

But he is not escaped yet.

01:44:55

Then i lost his token because it's so fucking tiny.

01:45:21

Money. Once the opening is 40,

01:45:31

Or back.

01:45:39

No way. Cool. I really wish this thing would show me what it was. But uh, all right, so first action, i'm just gonna Do whatever the full movement is. I mean, let me see if it'll actually allow me to do that, okay?

01:46:01

So it. Yes. Yes. Game it is my turn. I would like to do stuff. Why are you spamming me? It does that sometimes oh, i was removing extra dead people from the combat tracker of. Okay, feel free to continue doing that and i'll i just realized the correlation that that was coming up.

01:46:24

Every time i removed someone from the initiative. Like, resetting up next. You're all set though. Make sense.

01:46:53

And 15. So to switch the action go invisible again.

01:47:01

The.

01:47:12

You see him furiously flapping upwards. I i sure do. I sure do. Um, to which my next unfortunate question given that i am currently. Invisible is how many 10 foot ranging criminals weighs that? It's a lot, right? It's more than 40. I think, uh, even know what the, i've never know what's wrong with an increments are bad.

01:47:47

Fucking massive. I'm probably going to ignore this question but i figure i might as well ask he's within your increments if you're asking if he's with an orange of sneak attack. Definitely not. Yeah, you could, you could throw throw up throwing weapon at him. I know i'm thinking about it but but i don't know what it is and i'm not wasting this poison on it.

01:48:08

So you know what? No, that's fair. Uh, yeah. See, you were thinking sneak attack? That's not what i was gonna call. Um, sherry can is 10 feet, ranging come in. It is which is a lot of range increment failures that i'm going to have as a result endometer. So that's 60.

01:48:31

That's a double. No. Uh, oh yeah. Okay, i see the fucker. Sorry to us up. Dear. I was afraid. Everyone was gonna die without me in the room. I'm amazed. You can see me i'm continually horrified that you can see me actually but you don't have the invincibility on right now.

01:49:15

It's it earlier. There we go. You did. Apologies game is being game. See i now have like work work. Yeah game. Please stop. There we go. I saw like quit my tokens. Double go ahead. Just does the coya thing where she's like, i'm ready in action to cast your critical wounds and i pulled out my hand so that no way into it.

01:49:48

Yeah.

01:49:52

Yeah, yeah. I suppose, as opposed to koya being omnipotent or constantly seeing through invisibility, Boom.

01:50:11

Oh right. Well, that's one. Why did it's fucking switch back again? What is happening today? It's been like, this. Feel like the last week. I think the last update found it's knocked its legs out from under a bit. Yeah, i'm not sure it's version 10 was a stabilized. I thought it was time to fucking my life.

01:50:54

Uh no. Hey, what's it actually aiming for you, but

01:51:05

Oh yeah, you you can you can definitely have a will save

01:51:13

And the fourth roster will save to. Am i caught on that? Nope, looks like you're just outside the range. Yeah. He was aiming for the cleric in the paladin.

01:51:36

He was fairly certain were good people. Uh, okay. So, uh, koya. Oh,

01:51:49

Oh this is oh, she rolled up two. Okay. Uh, wait not real well no. Oh, war bamzo. What what do you mean? There's an insufficient charges. Well bamzo. Coyote gets very make that safe. You have lingering proponent. What do you mean? Do you have lingering performance? No, this doesn't and performance.

01:52:24

Yes. Does that start me from? Yeah, okay. I didn't know if you were objecting like, saying i couldn't. No. No. I just need to help it on.

01:52:37

Oh yeah, it takes half.

01:52:42

Hey everyone. Inspire courage goes off.

01:52:48

I have takened it off.

01:52:53

So, every two gastro levels, thankful caster 48 or

01:53:06

I did seven.

01:53:12

Slightly set, boom. Video. Oh, that was not. It's not as much damage this way. I was expecting a second now. That's the second puzzle. Spell.

01:53:31

Oh, fucking find my spellbook. Yeah, but you stop the second just kind of. Yeah, stopping the second was is good.

01:53:44

I'm 17 visibility of myself. Sure and so here, oh there's invisible shit. They're at in the sea invisibility buff or something.

01:54:19

And my turn. Already coachee ochi seeing where grace and shot before. But figuring the tuna walk is probably smart enough to have moved. It's just going to try and get away from these spirit boys, who keep trying to hug him and is going to i'm shit. I forgot to roll their attacks that's good.

01:54:46

Keep that's fine. I'll just be over here away from their attacks. And yeah, he's gonna wait until someone can call out to him while her tuna. Lark, is that so you can do some stabbing on him?

01:55:08

If you want to roll their attacks on the, you totally can

01:55:13

Actually seeing if they make attacks opportunity.

01:55:25

Don't think they do. I think they've arrived flanking but they don't and threatening but they don't make effect opportunity if they did, i would roll to get away from them because i figured they would have actually been swinging at me when i was standing there because they never last round, they never took one.

01:55:39

So i would say, we can roll those attacks on me, but if they tried to take aops, i would just join. No, you're good. It's just a spelled that look went off uh their spiritual allies on the field.

01:55:59

Yeah, they kind of blend in the background there.

01:56:04

Boom, everything. Here is blue just moving over there. Itchy. Yeah, i just wanted to get away from them. All righty shoko. Uh, okay, so how can i get down to roaches? Uh but i just hope hey uh man they they can make it a text from opportunity.

01:56:37

They can. Where did you find that rule? It's right in the spiritual. I spell. That's okay because i rolled a 31. Yep. Twice like both level provides one. I only gets the one though. Well, that's okay. He doesn't prove it anyways.

01:57:07

Not that we want anything about to happen, choco? Uh, okay. So, uh, can i? So this is a steer drop here. How do i these rocks? You can climb down. They're difficult terrain. Okay, all of the big rocks. Are just the ones that i came down. Just those ones.

01:57:31

So this one's still a cliff, by the way, there's the sentence.

01:57:40

You just made that up. That's not true. I just completely skipped over the last half of that sentence. I'm sorry, chuckle move, 30, feet and restart verdict performance. So put that buff back on everybody. I think i'm gonna rain, right? Everyone's in range of life. Oh, it's fire encourages.

01:58:08

Whoever can hear it.

01:58:13

And that'll be shut. This turn.

01:58:40

Actually time or ten. No sweet story thing to activate.

01:58:53

Como, uh, amigo looks at the flaming sword. Uh, nods.

01:59:04

Very long answer itself again.

01:59:17

Runs and jumps down her ring of feather falling activating before she hits the bottom.

01:59:28

And activate the visibility purge. Well, the sword releases a burst of golden flames and he becomes outlined invisible because he fails to say. Yeah, those parts. The good one. Uh, no perch has no save. Purge is the good one.

01:59:56

And no sui has unlocked the level. That's fine. You just owe me an elixir racing.

02:00:07

Uh, you guys hear the sound of a machine gun getting loaded and he's gonna let lose knowing that there's still that wind barrier thing, but, you know, still gonna try. Now, there's only one 50 percent miss chance.

02:00:28

100% dead and i'll take just high for all of them. Okay, the third arrow won't hit. So, first arrow. Hello. Second arrow is high.

02:00:56

The boom, 30. I misses he arrow. Mrs, that's really rough. Anyone got through oh i'll take it. You, you hit him. And that's all there the closet. Thanks is lucky stars and completely fucks off.

02:01:22

And just takes a full run action away, no way.

02:01:37

So this is all difficult to run, right? That is great. Is there a drop from from like here to here for mike? This square. I'd like to paint and like like, no, well, you can drop from there. But you can also climb down using difficulty ring, or you can just difficult to run as a myth to me, so exactly, yeah, it doesn't matter.

02:02:05

Yeah. Um, i'm just trying to determine which way is shorter keeping in mind that i actually do have a climb speed. So i don't really care which way it is. Um, And either case i'm gonna swift action. Increase my movement speed by 20 and use your light steps. Your claims for you 20.

02:02:36

Yeah i can't ignore difficult. Trying. This route will be faster. Yeah, it's pretty much what i thought. So 25.

02:02:47

So that's any kind of uh, 25. I'm just trying to determine. I actually travel domain blessing off. I don't know. It's back on now like that speed. Doesn't look right. All right. So that was 55. You have a 60 i'm double moving. So, i have a, i, i'm the best as i fucking like, and end up behind this guy.

02:03:21

Still invisible, not that. I think he'll survive much longer but hey, huh? Pronounce. Oh, and i suppose she did swipe that heel. Thanks Glenn.

02:03:42

Unless that was quite a healing herself. Nope.

02:03:50

Yep, there is mysteriously small, patches of blood pooling on the area, directly behind this present moment but it's just No confused.

02:04:14

Mentorship. I ain't got to explain anything. Pretty products, my keyboard.

02:04:25

Nope, not quite littles, right?

02:04:43

Or the healings. Oh god, i just missed Sochi again. I was gonna sit here quietly. It's okay. All the damage i've taken is going to melee that i caused it all myself. She came down here to make sure no one died. So except for two in a while you're getting the healing.

02:05:08

Uh, speaking of

02:05:15

Uh, you and amiko both gazak sorts engineers. He tries to fly straight up and away from you.

02:05:26

Way in you're in the way.

02:05:41

Can you see invisibility? He cannot see invisibility. Okay? Bye. Wait, i don't think so. Pretty sure i would not be surprised. What is windsight? I don't think that's the invisibility though and you tell i play oracles a lot. I mean, if he's not one of the big three like mysteries, i wouldn't blame you.

02:06:12

He's a wind mystery. Exactly, nope. You're good.

02:06:22

He's done flat foot.

02:06:33

So yeah you think your what is happening to him?

02:06:44

Worst case, you'll bleed them {question-mark}.

02:06:51

Probably actually, but he does like 50 straight up if you beat shit up. Yep. You're also second and any natural llama that you have is reduced by full and none. Good.

02:07:13

Are they sickened if they don't have natural armor for you to cut off? If the bleed doesn't. Yep, i i guess i always assume that being flayed is what's sick and deal. Uh, yeah. It's there's still like an entire side of the the poor man's flank. That's just being a ripped off.

02:07:34

Uh, and that will second. You thumbs up regardless of whether that you have not llama. Uh, boop and boop.

02:07:50

Boom. High level. Oracles are bullshit. Zero. This is my first time using a high level Oracle's box. Oh thing, this guy fly without any kind of wings because i could see him from from here. I'm going to, you know, this is part of, you know, activating disability that i haven't had to use it in a while.

02:08:13

I'm using my quick study i'm gonna hit i'm gonna hit the, i'm gonna have the guy with a the spell magic and the cells supernatural abilities. Oh, i i didn't know if if it i didn't know if it was a supernatural ability that were out in this, i guess i would.

02:08:35

I feel wasted. They might have some spells cast on himself mr. And unless you identified, exactly the spell effect that's going off by using either detect magic or having arcane site. You don't know what spells are running. So you would instead cast a wild, dispel magic. That would just pop off.

02:08:54

Whichever was the highest level spell. Correct. Yep. That's perfect for everything. Pretty much what's gonna be happening here. So pretty much swapping out for one of what am i spells for a? Dispel magic.

02:09:13

Just kind of interest is this guy actually carrying any kind of what melee weapon. Uh, he has a staff.

02:09:26

I can't move from from this position. So yeah. Okay and i make a cash flow book. Check. Right. Correct. Your castle level plus a d20. And then once you have to dispel tricks, not the moment, the old you see eleven plus the spellcasters level. Okay.

02:09:54

I want to keep letting comfortable magic is. Oh, i'm gonna, i would probably i'm gonna be end up spending two working points, actually free action to expand of spell flat to make the cast of one higher than normal.

02:10:15

Oh, you're increasing your spell, caster level by one? Yep. That cost two arcing points when arcane and then one for the quick study. He's during the quick study to get dispelled magic and then increasing his casser. Level using another point. Very well carry on. Well here. Um, you're not really sure if anything happens.

02:10:47

You will need to spell magic. He doesn't fall from the air enough permit it. Grayson 12 actually but apparently the plus one didn't go didn't get ahead and a 12 is still not enough. The base AC is 11, plus his caster level grace into spell him with some arrows.

02:11:13

Oh, okay, yeah sure, i'll do that. Um uh i think i, you know what, i might be able to shoot him. Why not? What's the range on this? Hold on.

02:11:31

Would like to remind everyone that this flying invisible old. Man is not my creation potions. Wait, he's not invisible anymore, right anymore. He had to fly up and yell himself but he's now out of the radius of the purge. Wait. Um, oh no, he's not because it uses tendons.

02:11:59

Always capture level.

02:12:03

How high up is he? You said he flew up 50 feet. It's really purge app will uh no invisibility periods, last for a minute per level, and have the radius of 5 feet per caster level than negates all forms of visibility. I hate that. You said he flew up 50 feet, right?

02:12:22

That is great. So, how high would it be for me to shoot him?

02:12:31

Uh, let's see. You like 60 feet. If i use my little two barrel shooter it would, the range income is 40 feet. So i think he's inside the second one. So it's just the one negative, right? Even inside the first one. Yeah. Oh, your second range. Yes, yes, okay, then i'll show you him with, uh, an arrow.

02:12:50

Why not?

02:12:55

What is the penalty? For one reason, minus two.

02:13:11

I fire. I draw my two barrel shooter out and drop. One of my swords to do so and fire. Not him that will unfortunately miss him was worth a shot.

02:13:27

That will be OG's turn.

02:13:37

Okay, bringing us to shoko. Okay, so how high up is this guy? I don't even see him on the oh various, uh, but from them. He's 50 feet up uh for you, he's 20 feet up.

02:13:58

Five, 10 15.

02:14:09

Okay, those rocks are difficult to rain, are they? Yes.

02:14:21

Or am i speaking out of turn here? I know that these ones were nope. They're difficulturing. Okay, i'm just honestly flabbergasted it. She'll go balancing on these. Icy rocks that i've described as slippery multiple times. He's a fox. This is their like natural. It's true. That's why i feel amused.

02:14:44

They're very tiny, very light. Um okay. What's the range increment on some shuriken here. 10 feet 10. Okay. Okay. Significant 1 minuses. I think significant minuses your size. Yeah, you're looking at from where you are. Yeah, you're looking at like a minus six. To a minus eight depending on the angle.

02:15:12

He's only 20 feet up from him. Well, yeah, but like pythagoras. He's that's 30 feet to him. We're almost 20 feet up. So you're looking at another 10 feet, 40 feet. Yeah, so minus six.

02:15:31

Then i guess i won't go with the shuriken. I'll just go with my shortfow.

02:15:44

Out of ammunition, okay?

02:15:50

Pick up a rock and throw it on.

02:15:57

Deputy will not hit. All right. Good morning. Won't hit him. Why these 21? That's ridiculous. You're telling me this old, dude is only slightly less difficult to hit then ochi. Yeah, so air barrier what he has going right now, creates invisible share of air that grants. You a plus, four armor bonus at seventh level and every four levels.

02:16:26

After that this bonus increases by plus two. Oh yeah, i would have had a chance to miss anyways, because ranged attack, oracle bs man.

02:16:40

All right, grace, and delete. This guy, the mako pass turn.

02:17:10

Oops, i fucked up one of his bobs in your favor. So, we're just gonna keep it like that. Um,

02:17:35

She pulls it out in her one and taps yourself with it.

02:17:43

Oh, greasing.

02:17:49

He was spiritual analyze again. Okay, so it looks like he's about to party. He's like, i, oh, gee. Are you, are you sure? We don't want to like offer him, you know, the chance to surrender and and all that. No, you can kill him. I saw this coming and i was gonna do this joke if you didn't do this joke.

02:18:11

So i'm glad that you did.

02:18:16

I mean we played with each other for almost a year now. Yeah. No, we definitely have boom. Once again, i'll just do high on all the rules. All right, so one, two, and key hit. Potentially, you don't think so? First one hits. Second one. Hits third. One misses.

02:18:46

And, That was rough.

02:18:55

Uh, if you keep this up, you're going to beat him in a war of attrition. He will run out of cure spells, eventually, is he not trying to go out of the crevasse and the ceiling like the closet did?

02:19:18

I had already assumed he was fleeing because he has no more. Hello is really uh he actually just reached the point where he trades. The flea grace is knocked him to 28 feet. Exactly. So now he will change deplete but it is lump his turn. Choir gonna star knife the hell out of him.

02:19:42

No way. It's first ninjas. Can jump 50 feet in the air, right? If you invest for it, you totally can. Yeah.

02:20:03

Peeler is not the jumper. Her nickname is the peeler. Remember she invested in peeling the peeling tree. Well, the annoyed ninja looks even more annoyed, if she flicks a wrist pulls out, another vial chunks, the fucking thing, and then doesn't in fact, leap, 30 feet. And then stays that.

02:20:31

Why is a hell of a thing? It is a hell of a thing. And you're gonna fly speed of 60 feet madam. Oh i'm sorry, i'm sorry. 60 feet. You say plus the 10 extra from coyote so you have a 70 foot fly which means you can get it to melee with him.

02:20:52

Yep. Just gets get straight. I was like, hey and then banishes, oh that's uncomfortable.

02:21:14

Yeah. That's what, that's what it no way. Is that it? Yep, i had swift. Chug move. I'm not like i have a wetter consume these faster. So now it wasn't asking that koya points her hand up.

02:21:45

Where's my inventory? God damn. I can't believe I'm doing this. There we go.

02:21:54

Um, shoco, you are down so this doesn't hit you.

02:22:02

You.

02:22:19

Oh dear, no ice in. That isn't she, you know, oh,

02:22:27

And everything. It's not that i would blame you. If you did fire on me, boom. Koi. Is not a dps machine. No, but you did just blind the guy. That's a problem. I was gonna say why is that a problem? Uh, he is blind. Uh, he's screams a little bit and turns visible which means nothing to you.

02:23:03

No way and tries to run in a direction. He didn't see you because he has no idea. You can see him so make your attack opportunity.

02:23:18

Yeah, but when he runs his minions, try to murder the priestess. He does 23 years. Yeah, he does. Uh, so these are the, the delightful attacks that i made that no one got to see specifically for this encounter and then i forgot to existed. Oh, they're very nice. Thank you.

02:23:46

Thank you.

02:23:52

So, yeah. Um, i guess the dude's arm drops here. At the it like amigos feet. Yeah. So, he cleanses, he, he tries to fly away dies, and then just falls right back onto his own altar, uh, fitting ends for a oracle of sithid

02:24:28

It was way more annoying than i anticipated. It being

02:24:36

Shoko will backtrack to the young lady who was possessed by the closet. Um,

02:24:46

And she is dead dead. Oh wow. Oh show goes like, oh oh. That's that's yeah, you're not, you're not patch of that back up. No, no, any of the constitution of 14 she has negative 30. Something else negative 36. I mean as far as you're concerned, you look back there and there is the body of a young woman.

02:25:07

Just plotter, you never saw the closet. We never saw the closet, you see. Now, i covered in a lot of blood. Oh god. Well, this is villagers. Probably aren't going to like this. Oh, i don't know. It's a bit cozy. You got the altar and the lights and the troll that got fucking demolished.

02:25:36

Thanks Grayson. No. I mean the corpses of one of their children and their respected village shaman and we have no witnesses other than us to say that he was evil. Oh please. They wanted him to add us for the girl. Well, that's unfortunate though for what it's worth, the only person around here that uh, actually no, i'm gonna adjust that statement that statement.

02:26:07

Doesn't even make sense in this context, people that hit quota tend to need to die. I fixed it. Yes you did very well. Uh, i don't think this paints us in a very good light but i also don't think that there's any proving our side and all of this, i think it's best.

02:26:29

If i can find the smaller green thing polluting around somewhere. Yeah, i think it's best. We leave. But maybe we should take a look around and see if we can learn some more about what this monster was up to. We're going to appear into the cave that the horror frost spirits came out of.

02:26:49

I just looks like a pit where he was keeping undead. Can we take a closer look at the carvings and stuff down here that we? Yes, i was actually about to get to the development section of this room upon closer inspection. It's obvious to make out that these are down the standing.

02:27:10

Stones are easily identifiables the black monoliths acknowledge geography. Tech check for me please. She'll go already failed. That one well i get another go at it. One thing that my job is y'll, people.

02:27:38

It's asshole made me use two of my resources. I feel pretty bad about that. Yeah, i when you pop the second potion, i was like oh no. That's you're not getting that back. Thanks. Do you think i could have learned him down by using charm person? Maybe. Yeah, i'm back.

02:28:00

Nausea cream. Different knowledge geography. There we go. The other option would have been something like command.

02:28:12

Which i don't think yet.

02:28:19

The mountains behind the single tower tower are recognizable. As it's the alabastern peaks, that you saw on the map of the high ice.

02:28:33

Knowledge nature.

02:28:44

Uh, and anyone who speaks eritage. Floating upside down, get several.

02:29:02

The thing arms spiral are representing the uh morose codes or the hungry storms. Legendary blizzards that rage across the crown of the world. For those who speak erotaki, uh, the scrolling by the black winged woman, says patiana who speaks to me on the wind from her tower in the storm.

02:29:32

Oh, and then not long. After you start searching this area, you find what looked like white fragments.

02:29:55

Slightly tinged in almost metallic. Icey sheen. And once you find some more larger pieces, you realize that they are white dragon egg shells.

02:30:14

Yeah. Well, now we know why the wide bring it or image, it's always a drug and i'm sure it was on a run page regardless of it circumstances. But this doesn't exactly help. However, why what do you think you used the, the egg for make me persona dragon?

02:30:46

Especially a fair question. How how old have they been there? Do you want to add a survival check or something? Uh, yeah. It's gonna be real difficult because it's everything's frozen. Uh, but going give me a throttle. I'm in.

02:31:05

These people exist uh at least a year old not a year. How long it's been. And she remember engaging, let's move on.

02:31:24

A couple of months.

02:31:30

Okay. So dragon loses her, clutch for one reason or another gets mad about. It takes it out on the local populace. Tell me if this starts sounding familiar that sounds in line with what we've seen.

02:31:52

What's the deal with all of this? Stop. Anyway, i don't recognize any of this indicating to your like all of us. Yeah, like unhol reasonables. Yeah. The upside down ninja covered in blood is dripping over like half of the altern. Is like what's so bad about this? Well, it's an altar to suffer the nascent demon lord of blizzards and frozen corpses.

02:32:25

It's uh, yeah, it's not great. This is not a good place. No, but that's the case. Do we have a source of our ha cheap like goes over to the inscription and kind of porks at the uh, the storms? This whole thing connected. Well if i had to guess i would say that that lady on the only there was somehow communicating to this or cohere and i will coordinating their efforts to do something related to the dragon egg.

02:33:21

They stole. Hmm. Katyana, she sounds like a bitch. Yeah. So this tunak is working to like empower the hungry storms or more spread the hungry storms. Just, i don't understand this religious stuff shoko. Maybe you can use your knowledge role to tell us more. Hopefully question mark. I'm not making the connections here.

02:33:57

What? He was trying to accomplish by sacrifices. I don't think there's much in the connections and more to do with the fact that he clearly had a like for the lady. And she folks at the the air attackee inscription and i could let's see what's the line again? Uh tatiana.

02:34:19

Who whispered who speaks to me on the wins from her tower in the storm? Oh yeah. So my question would be, then where is this tower in the storm and how do we make her like him? Yeah. So and we got location of where we think a possibility for that place is from the geography.

02:34:40

Check right somewhere on the high ice. What do this place? Oh, good story. Thank you, story driver, get down here. Go. Look at this head mistress. Um sorry you had to see all this uh we chased after uh tuna walk. You said his name was and too young to go to jail.

02:35:12

If we could just it was self-defense.

02:35:21

Uh, shoka will point at some of the sigils and say that is the essential of sylhid. The nice and demon lord of blizzards. He appeared to have been driving his power from a profane source. We are familiar with this in here. His power is strong in the north.

02:35:47

Well, she's she's looking in fear and disgusts that the the pictogram specifically of the towers. I knew that spirit quest was a bad idea.

02:36:02

Because what do you mean something? You're not telling us at the very center of the north. We call them, the nameless spiers, and she points at the, the mass of black spiers. On one of the, the room stones. And work went there to speak with the commune, with the spirits of air, or we believe all wind spirits, reside in that dangerous place and that is a source of great visions for those who can, who can see.

02:36:40

But nothing like this is ever happened in our history, and who is this woman?

02:36:53

Some deeply unpleasant individual by the name Katyan. And if i'm reading that script correctly, i am not familiar with her power in the storm. Is that one of these spiers? You said, talked just said,

02:37:14

That one, that's how we believe was also made by the same people who built the nameless towers. But it is much further away, it is close to a mountain range.

02:37:31

If it were to be oriented on a compass and the high ice was a compass, uh, with unaimo, and it's relative position, say south whereas the other tower next to the mountain range on the compass. I'm like bumpers, we do not use compasses on the high, ice up down, left or right a b, a b start actually, trying to find the map of the crownload effect.

02:38:06

There's for some reason. It's at the very top of the list instead of where it's supposed to be circle, will apologize for the corpse of a young girl at the entrance of the cavern thing and explain what happened with her. As far as he knows, he didn't see the closet pop out of her.

02:38:24

He just knows that she started trying to murder coya. It is terrible.

02:38:35

So, the nameless fires are here. It's actually being their own hex but it's okay. Uh, and the storm spire is over here.

02:38:50

She said it was much farther, they're, they're very close together. You forgetting, how big each of those? Hexes are no. But, i mean, from where we are, those are relatively safe distance. Oh, from you. All of the other nameless fires are here. This is the only one that's in a different place.

02:39:11

Okay, the way that it was described at first, and the way that i pictured it, i took the nameless fires to be like here and then the other one to be, like, somewhere like way out here, or something like that. Oh no. No, the storm spiers where you're going.

02:39:29

The nameless fires are not covered in this AP, okay.

02:39:40

So the strong spiders are on the way, then they're in the, they're in the way, never mind on the way it is. True. They are weirdly in your path. Yes, they are. Convenient. Check your nails. His eyes, indeed.

02:40:06

I know what were you doing if the dragon believes that we killed her children, she will never stop trying to kill us.

02:40:21

It is not wish to ask you for any more, but i fear. I need to unless the very next words out of your mouth aren't please go and kill the fucking dragon. Uh, i'm going to question what you're doing, honoring your ancestors and such a fashion. What i'm being sarcastic.

02:40:46

Oh no. Please kill the fucking dragon. Thank you, but we have no warriors up to this task.

02:40:58

We do have some things that will help you on the boreal. In the boreal plane though.

02:41:09

Do you think your people will be willing to help us after? Well, this

02:41:19

I'm not going to lie when i first came in, i assumed it was one of our enemies that killed Nakun but then you told me it was you and the murderer would have. Let me just believe a falsehood, you spoke, the truth.

02:41:41

For what? It's worth this one. All right, and went down as painlessly as i could. Certainly manage. It was my husband's second for a long time. She was a great warrior. It is said that, she goes this way, but we do not choose our path. Only what we do with it.

02:42:08

She was your husband's second. Second. What it's second is.

02:42:23

Okay, i thought this was what it seems to confuse or even more. Um i was about to be like is this like a sister wife situation for like a brief moment? We're just kind of like say a few words and they're attacking and then just be all like up prodigy different.

02:42:42

This apprentice i was like, oh, he killed your husband's other wife? That's probably we probably did you a favor you know? Like, oh my gosh, not, not how they, they work.

02:42:59

What impression do you have there? Attacking people soji. Hey, we don't try to judge. We don't know. They all look the same to me. Oh my god. Wow. That was, i need you to leave my village now. Just just that one, don't kill a dragon and go kill the fucking ground.

02:43:21

I'm sorry. I'm on one today. I had to i had to do it. Oh, she, when you look at a murder of crows, do they all look the same to you? Of course not. That's really racist. Why don't you stay such a thing? What's your eyebrow look? Did you?

02:43:42

No. I just like, you know, as the, the fly potion kind of wears off and she descends back to the ground just kind of turns to the, uh, the head must dressing is just like in our attacking. This is what i'm having to deal with. Sometimes I wish I'd be born to the north.

02:43:59

It seems like you have found your family. The face, i've just disgust

02:44:14

It would not be a family if we did not want to kill them, it's no way. Is the, the cat meme of a, what is this, affection? Disgusting, do it again.

02:44:30

That's not even wrong.

02:44:36

To before her understanding of family pretty much consists of ninjas, massive bitch like that is for true. I feel like a quick question before we leave this village or whatnot. Village town village. It doesn't have any good books.

02:45:07

What books looking for the library? Yes, i'm looking for some books to purchase, you know, something for reading material. They weren't going to trade with us last time. If you remember, yeah, they specifically banned us from it.

02:45:28

Which is gonna look great. Which actually, we're gonna have to get down into the nitty gritty of how this settlement is, structured isn't a capitalist society. And as that is do they support social programs such as a library that is not for profit? Because if they don't do not have a library that i'm just going to tell you that right now.

02:45:51

Uh, it's qualities are in sealer and strategic location. It's government is a council and these are the magical items that currently has available to purchase. We can't buy it. This will alter if you slave the dragon because right now it is currently undergoing a negative but this is vantage hunted which is reducing its face value and its purchase limit because trade has been disrupted, this is what's currently available purchase though.

02:46:27

I thought we couldn't do any back. We couldn't buy anything. We should have flawed. Oh, no. You, you can buy stuff now. Now that we killed that guy. Yes. Oh, he is not rallying people against you. The potion of flies going missing. You like how that was? There is going missing.

02:46:56

Hey, we're gonna take our little breaker here. Oh, that's stack of journeys. I have a question about that, uh, ask me after the break. Okay. Okay. Brb.

02:47:12

Stop of what i'm stafford doing. It's a really good staff, right? And we're going to use it. How i'm going to return it.

02:48:07

I have some news. Y'all. Oh my gosh. Why is this guy damning me? When he knows? I have a boyfriend, i should reply and figure it out.

02:48:32

Why is so small? Why is a small? Why is so tiny? He's so little quick and easy way to make a feather stick which makes great tender for starting fires.

02:49:05

Guess the correct. Christian rock song titles.

02:49:50

Oh,

02:50:06

Infidite.

02:50:12

Oh people. Come on. Dude, this is rock wall. Oh my god. You're gonna die. Dude, what the fuck. Drop it like. Oh, drop it. Like it's hot here today.

02:50:43

You want me to get a green eye and green screen. It that houses are broken home.

02:51:03

The slope tone wood is irrelevant is just not true? Says poorly fucking Smith. Of course he's going to say that. He owns a fucking guitar, just one of those days where you don't want to wait.

02:53:27

I absolutely love kettlebell swing. So here's a quick tutorial on how to perform them. You're going to start by learning the mechanics of the hip hinge. With the bell between you by, i'm not by oh i think i'm not buying all right. Hey why? Why? Why you're drunk by drop by.

02:53:45

Okay, but let me ask you something, right? Let me ask you is bisexual this okay? If in high score, when i was younger, i did suck a couple pps right while i was drunk, right? Yeah. But i didn't want to be doing it. I would rather have vagina. Yeah.

02:54:00

Right. But they weren't available, they didn't like me. Right. Right. So i went to the second best source. Yeah. It's a little bit of like a well, McDonald's is closed. Let's kill a homeless guy, guys. You're by, i'm not by 30 seconds.

02:54:35

You're weird. You're weird as fuck. My master's biggest.

02:54:47

If light travels slower than c in a medium, would it be possible to outpace? All right, we have stealing made this desk way too big and it didn't fit in the room, which was a disaster that started with installing the bottom cabinets than the desktop, which was tight, but we made it work.

02:55:03

But before that, i had spent days pre-assembling, a lot of the smaller pieces so we can install everything sections at a time. And i thought i'd measured everything correctly to fit in between the two walls and under the ceiling. And all we'd have to do is attach all the sections to the walls.

02:55:17

And at first it was all working until it was time to install the overhead shelves. But it would be too late before i found out because the reason we didn't install everything piece by piece was because i designed this desk so that not a single screw would be visible when anyone used this office space.

02:55:31

But when it was time to lift the big overhead shelf into place, we realize the shelves on the sides were too tall to fit everything, underneath the ceiling. So we had to take everything off and cut the sides shorter and much to Gabby's disappointment. In my measuring efforts, this made a huge mess that we were later.

02:55:46

Have to clean up the ceiling, but we still had to spend probably an hour pounding these thing into place and it shook the whole house but we eventually got it where it needed to be but not without scratching up our walls like crazy. But at least now we have a built-in desk as soon.

02:56:03

Ready to be used. We accidentally made this desk way too big and it didn't fit in the room, which was a disaster that started with installing the bottom cabinets within the desktop, which was tight, but we made it work. But before that, i had spent days pre-assembling, a lot of the smaller pieces so we can install everything sections at a time.

02:56:20

And i thought i'd measured everything correctly to fit between.

02:56:30

You're trying ends, you take dimensional agility, so that either, if you're going down the root of the abundance, that monk or the flickering, step fighter with conduit feeds or your, a conjuration wizard to specifically took teleportation to mental shift, even then you need to ask your GM. If it counts, in order to be able to do extra shenanigans off the back of that whether you're going to dimensional dovish for full attacks while teleporting, or just being able to do more things, by virtue of, you know, not immediately ending your turn.

02:57:02

Honestly, i would say no. Uh, specifically, because dimensional derivatives calls out, a class feature such as abundant steps specifically or cast abundant step. So, yeah, or testament is a mandatory requirement to picking up the irish. So you have to take it anyway because i was talking about the the conjuration.

02:57:30

Oh yeah, i know you. No, no, that's no. You. Now, when we can't do that, we already have conduit feeds that can do that. She says, sarcastic. Okay, which now allow you to take the dimensional things as combat feet, which obviously, i think was a nice kind of mid-ground fix.

02:57:48

So that's fair. Yeah. So, i don't know what you're getting at, right? Like, it's not an action, it's not. No, it's fine.

02:58:05

Okay, and there was something about the staff of journeys. But we already we've already figured that one out. Just to fill you in. How would you charge it or dance up? Is you do if you see, i wanted to forever reason, you could charge it through the ginger elements spell because it is on the outline spell list.

02:58:30

But you don't have full slot casting yet. So you can't actually recharge it because it has freedom of movement as an option. So you would need somebody who has full public housing for you know. Well and at least one of the spells on there to which personally i'm just like oh look at stuff of journey is, why don't you just throw that ahead?

02:58:49

But travel clerk. Yeah, coya has what every spell on there except the tech snarling bits? I think which is interesting because that's like a writer. I don't think you guys really good at both. I mean, it's on the druid less of wood. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense.

02:59:14

I can rest that draw the droid spell list is like volume spell list but i don't intimately now, i don't play them enough.

02:59:30

Sorry, i'm i'mma shut up for the rest of the damn enough, but you're you guys don't have to leave immediately. You are still welcome to stay the night. They will sell to you. Now i am returned and try to do some buying welcome back gochi.

02:59:54

Portion, apply vanishes mysteriously up here, nicely neatly stacked, where it was uh you mean 750 gold sometimes? Actually, whatever it is. Sure, i'm not. Now here's a question because i had something that i maybe wanted grace into build. Can we sell anything to them? And also base value is 450 gold and they're purchase limit is 2500.

03:00:27

You know, i'm just gonna post the whole thing like to keep scrolling around looking for these stats.

03:00:41

So they probably can't buy us out of our party loot cell total. Oh, not by a long shot on the 750 from top. Yeah, this is not. Done a dangerous plus. 20, can't imagine why?

03:01:11

Yeah, i don't really have anything that i want to buy. Then it is disability. Yeah, i understand that. I was just oh, by the way you can now act off the shaman part he did. That's that's fair. I'm highly amused by chaotic ebook. I'm waiting for quite but so if what did you do while everyone else's neutral?

03:01:42

Sorry, sorry. So if no way kills the shaman does it mean she's the new shaman? No is a princess. We'll take over, she just died too. Where's that some random girl? Yep. That wasn't that wasn't his apprentice. All right, no way. Go kill these princess.

03:02:05

That would definitely go to kicked out. No, no i want to hear this one out. Why?

03:02:18

Wasn't wasn't well part now. Gotta be careful with those statements on more than happy to murder someone for you. Save my life and plenty more occasions. I'm decided to ultimately help me out. Gets grabbed.

03:02:42

But what's going on? What? What is no way done? I think koi is scolding her. Taking this line of conversation. I didn't hear the first part of the wall, i'd conversation. Oh, did you guys think that was actually Grayson saying that in person?

03:03:06

As i wasn't doing his voice at all. Sorry we're fun. This is more gooping around. I'm i'm i'm playing with it because it's funny. Koi is perfectly. Happy to grab an ear. Why? Why is it that we've met with the the hearth mistress. But not the actual chief, uh, because i only made one of them.

03:03:34

Actual change is probably busy. Making sure that the the small village doesn't lose its collective shit over being attacked. By a, he also goes with the hunting parties to help protect them. Now, something like that. I imagine job. Uh so from our from our loot list the um uh the ring of mine shielding scene is of interest to shoko.

03:04:01

Uh i will be very useful in certain social situations once i have that and cunning caster which i plan on taking soon what it do. Uh, the ring of mine shielding. Oh, it just mess your you from any detect, alignment detect, thoughts?

03:04:30

Will be easier to be a good liar with it.

03:04:35

Neat.

03:04:51

Yeah, whenever you guys are really

03:05:00

Has anyone conveniently got a book just called how to slay dino dragons?

03:05:12

Um, not in this area.

03:05:19

I can pray for one.

03:05:28

We should all make sure. We have some kind of range weapon for this. If we do encounter a dragon and i'm not necessarily looking, let me try OG voice it more. I'm not necessarily looking to fight a dragon but um if it happens oh definitely we're not equipped to fight something the last conversation or something.

03:05:52

Ah, we're fighting the dragon. Yeah absolutely. Um, is there any sort of maybe? Uh so anything we can buy to make fighting a dragon easier.

03:06:09

Stare at the plus three white dragon hide breath plate.

03:06:16

Well, that would be incredibly expensive, wouldn't it?

03:06:22

Yeah, it breaks. You asked what you could buy, it's there. You could get it i think uh unless we want to split up loot and like decide how much gold everyone has right now, shuttle has 1000 gold on him so i'm looking for yeah, options to deal with. We've all had a partial bit of this conversation.

03:06:45

I understand that they have asked us to kill this dragon and i think, oh, gee would want to help them, but i also don't think that ochi necessarily wants to fight a dragon. I think that's scares him a little bit and then we, they can't buy enough stuff for us to sell all of our gold in order to have enough money to buy something like that.

03:07:04

So we're right back to me saying i, we all need to make sure that we have at least ranged weapons in case we encounter the dragon. Oh, i have, i have a range weapon at this point me. I'm really trade trade items. It is an aristocy village in the crown of the world.

03:07:24

They are open to the barter system.

03:07:34

All right, all right. Um, also kind of letting, you know, this is a great time to do this logistics stuff since we only have half an hour left and our session and we're not starting a dragon fight this session. Okay. Okay, so the dragon fight, how does it work out if we're trying to barter stuff?

03:07:54

Is it still same rules? Like we could just essentially trade items straight across and like convert it into gold for keeping track. How does their special rules for that? I would say that if you are open about going to go and deal with the dragons, they will trade, you do item trains on a one-for-one basis.

03:08:16

So one golden worth to one golden worth instead of half.

03:08:35

All right, then we're level seven.

03:08:47

I don't know what we would buy to fight a dragon. Um, potions of fly perhaps potions of fly would probably be good. I don't know that much about the flying rules either, how fast are dragons versus what a potion of why very much faster than us.

03:09:10

But at the same time, is anyone forgetting the little token? You got oh yeah, we got that token. The musical music box? Yes. I i still have that on me. Huh? Can someone enlighten me on what the music box is? Oh, we got that uh, from a silver dragon who was hunting the white dragon and he said that if we play the music box, the the silver dragon will come to our a once.

03:09:41

Okay. I mean, unless the dragon has a way of doing a handy, fandangled ways of not bleeding to death.

03:09:57

I mean that's fair. I'm that's just the same certain questions. Yeah, that's fair. Um, i mean, let's you've got lots of ways to fight a white dragon. You also have fireball on your arcane gas there, so,

03:10:16

Admittedly did get to do that for this fight. When that would have been very useful. So it's more useful for the white dragon. Yes, but over reliance on the single thing is failure. So it's true. I just think you guys shouldn't be quite so nervous about this dragon fight.

03:10:34

Oh, i want to go met with the dragon. Please let me know the dragon about absolutely eviscerating. It, it is still a dragon so it's gonna be a dangerous fight. No, now, do i have fireball but i can throw at it. I also have scorching gray.

03:11:03

We don't delay for me to make it a great worm.

03:11:08

But then what i have to worry about it was, if it has spell resistance, which will be empty and a half, which you will be able to judge when you finally get close enough to know what age category, it is you know an issues have is do we have any downtime before we fight this thing or it's going to be on media thing?

03:11:31

You have a day of rest or more. If you'd like to find downtime is what i would probably ask. What do you want to do? Yeah. Not downtime, downtime. But you have a day of rest, okay? Dear rest. I gotta find somebody with a fever need that. I want to retrain and good.

03:12:00

Look with that. Yeah, that takes five days. You don't have enough time for that. Okay by time. Are there like any magical ways we could keep the dragon glue to the ground? Maybe, you know, when you spell scrolls we could buy, you have

03:12:23

Oh, that's all we can buy not. Not like the, it's a village. Do you see the population 134 guys? Come on. Well, yes, yes. But i okay. Okay, i just i get this this pushback every time any of my groups, go to a village, like i want to sell all the super expensive stuff, they're offering to trade with you, those through the items they have, it's a small village, it's a regular village, not even a small village these, these places don't have the economies to support adventures sometimes.

03:13:03

No. And that's where i was at. I was just like, let's just make sure we can all pass around some range weapons. Make sure we have some range weapons because we can't really get anything from these guys that's going to be. I do have a ring button. That's no i was just reinforcing his point is like i yeah there's not really much we can buy and sell here.

03:13:20

It's the tiny. I got the feel from the map of the 10 buildings. Yeah, then it's a small village and i can't offer you away to get the white dragon hide if you wanted to trade for it, i know you guys have some magic items that you need to sell.

03:13:36

So if you have stuff equal little in value because they'll give you the full value and trade, you can get it. All right. Well, let's let me look at this, huh? I mean, do i have anybody who would even wear that medium armor? I mean stand true but he's not usually part of the party.

03:13:57

He's going to wait for caravan, um,

03:14:06

I think we play it can wear that armor.

03:14:12

Here's a question. Couldn't eco where they are. No, amigo news, three light. No, or no armor, okay?

03:14:24

Well, i contain the price of that. Plus three. Dragon height. I don't think it's going to be useful to us. Well based on the fact that this is a relatively small village and quite frankly, the logistic things is something you guys have pretty much enhanced. I mean, no admitted one thing and she saw like that.

03:14:46

So um can i i know it's a small place but based on the fact that they are currently being harassed by this dragon um would it be possible for me to do? Like i got a gather information to try and find out how this thing attacks because i have two must have known tactics.

03:15:06

So no ed being, how do i find something and kill it is going to go, how does it fight? And go into ask the people that would probably know information out of that. Can they are more than happy to provide all of that information with very little effort on your part as scripted in the ap?

03:15:27

Cool. Oh, you had to do was ask yeah. Like no, i just goes up and like brazenly in their native. Language is just like, all right? So here's the deal. Good job. We're gonna go and kill your dragon. So or fucking real white dragons are actually one of the most harassy of the dragons.

03:15:58

Uh which is delightful because like you say how 3.5 treated them like dogs, uh, so they not only have a great fly speed but they also have a decent burrow speed and a decent swim speed so they can come at you from almost any warm train Right? They also instill a deep fear in people when they attack, one of the air utaki almost equally describes, his friends being yanked up into the sky before another was pulled beneath the earth and the the frigid cold that took his, his brother's leg and he died in the field on their way back, like the dragon is vicious.

03:16:57

But not a powerful spoke after like other dragons, but that can be confirmed with your arcanistan barred.

03:17:06

Oh no. You'll be level eight after this. Yeah. Um, okay. So is there, how does one? Was it been then this fuck? Then to stock. I forget what the next one. Oh thanks, vexent vag, then veggies and bag. Thank you, i will write this down. Phonetically in my name.

03:17:39

It's a hell of a name. Oh, very very intuit. Um, vixenbach. Okay. Now that i can someone. Yeah, thanks Bob. So how are people like typically attacked? But if it's bug, duh, there's do they have a preference for like, if they have all of these options. Do they have a preference of attacking from the ex when we saw them?

03:18:11

It was like from the air saying she descends from the air first and then burrows into the ground to hunt down runners. Okay. Um, what methods of attack have you tried? Um i i know you will be perfectly skilled and violence but yeah they say the most of their weapons, bounced off of her hide.

03:18:45

You do home. And looking at that full round action, none of their hunters ever stood more than a few seconds in her path. They were ripped to shreds because god damn, dude, dragons get? Uh, as as i've said, many a time from my 3.5 days, the only thing scarier than a dragon's fall attack is hearing the words.

03:19:15

So, the dragon flurry of blows and then crushes, that is the only thing that i have ever been truly scared table. It's pretty delightful. Actually dragon honestly, like people like, oh, like dragon sorcerers are terrifying and such. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they don't scare me.

03:19:36

Dragon monks. Hey.

03:19:44

Talking about varian is just more strength. Dragon. Monk gets a hell a lot more i prefer. Dragon paladin pass. My my attachment to paladins at the moment is that they they talk shit and get crit. So, um, when they'll forgive me, let's let's not forget that you've killed me yesterday.

03:20:08

I didn't kill you fair. Yeah, i was way funny building the door of my unconscious body with the boss fight killed me. Wait, what? I haven't been sacrificed my character. I don't know. I loved it. Yeah, that's almost like she's out. Nope. We're playing in a bloodlords game. So it's an evil game and i completely respected.

03:20:29

Abby's decision. It's exactly what among would have done it, but they're positions have been thought. Oh, dear god, i would and i would have respected that and been like, yep, that's fine. The thing you need to understand, okay? Is that this is a fairy that clocked out, two basically frontline like fighter types in a round in three options, it managed to basically go pop up and i just went.

03:20:54

Nope, i'm good. It makes you feel better. I'm going to have taken your body and mum. If i do honestly in the day, would have appreciated that. Excuse me for just um anyway, sorry to sorry, to distract. Um, i know some of you have have things to do with your days and such so well, i'll keep on topic.

03:21:17

Um so altern. So this dragon is an altern vehicle that typically that's a good way to describe my dragons. Yeah, yeah. So it's a, it's an ATV the attacks predominantly from the air and then burst the ground to follow a retreaters. If it needs to get that far. Um, from those engines yeah, you're able to get.

03:21:47

You can also determine that it's large size category which will let you folks with knowledge, our kind of figure out, it's age, category delightful awesome. So already working together? No. I actually using like actual knowledge gathering skills appropriately. You know that thing she's supposed to do it is an adult steel, okay?

03:22:18

Which means it does have its aura of ice and it's freezing fog. All right, i'm surprisingly, i need a top preparing the response and then but it's just not yet. Have its blizzard or ice to mobility. So based on what you've you've mentioned. I'm going to talk a little bit of meta because i understood some of it.

03:22:52

So good movement stuff. Uh we'll do birds and some like that we'll just full attack a bitch because it's a dragon. Of course it will as well. It's a white dragon, it's a white dragon. I heard a description that sounded suspiciously like fish and presents and i thinking, right?

03:23:11

Uh, fuck. You do not need to answer your presence, is it is it that's rightful presence. Okay. You know what? I was talking something. Okay cool. Yeah. Um, but no. Okay, that's a problem. No. I doesn't know that i do. I'm gonna fail a lot. Wish. Well, we had time to prepare for this encounter.

03:23:45

I can blow my third levels or yeah. You you don't have enough slots. Arcanist of magic. Do you have enough slots? The answer is no of course you don't just prepare, whatever you think is most appropriate. Um, Yeah because i don't know anything about frightful presence. But uh, by which i mean no it doesn't, but i you don't, it's a sec.

03:24:17

Okay. It's a stacking fearfish grounds. Yeah, yeah. Um, i'm not gonna apply. I heard that and i went so i'm gonna be out of this combat. Yeah, i will i get rerolls but i'll still have a pretty hard time with that grace and should be fine. I don't know how zeo will fare against that.

03:24:41

But like i said, i will say right. Oh, she's a little scared of fighting and dragon. I coaches not dressling. I understand we're gonna go fight the dragon. I'm just saying like oh yes appropriately no way you've noticed this just gone full suicide in this day. Like you're pretty sure this is just her going.

03:25:01

I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. This is i want everyone to be respectful and prepared for the battle. You are going into with all of your guides of work between gathering information, finding how it's attacks? Crop crossroad thing with your arcana knowers, uh, shoko. And yeah, she'll go. And i almost called you Rio.

03:25:25

Uh, zero, i want you to understand what this dragon will have. If he gets, if she gets the full attack, you minus the breath weapon.

03:25:45

This is going to be a dangerous fight. Makes that's pretty good coat. Oh, 12d4. Yeah, do we have a caster? Who can do resist energy. I'm sadly. Don't have it. I don't, i forget even realize there. I was in felt going to need flarrett where this is why you're doing the important thing and not just rushing off to the white dragon's layer.

03:26:18

And i probably would have murdered half your group if you would just rush straight to the dragon's layer.

03:26:27

Okay, i know with the dragon it has dragon senses so i'm i'm gonna just don't half of my usual strategies out of a window. Just stab is a dragon but since does it have, it's dragon. It's a dragon. I they tell stories about dragons or if they used to among the frozen shadows the general consensus was don't.

03:26:51

Um, dragon, see-through lies, which is problematic for obvious reasons here, i do have a question.

03:27:05

Do they have a i guess a withered in the town. Uh no. They had an oracle overhead on. Okay, their third level casting is no longer there. Okay, the neck throws that idea out the window.

03:27:28

Uh, do you think we could maybe try and use our words to get an advantage with this dragon? Considering we know what it's motivations. Are Minneapolis. We could leer it down to us with promises. That we know where it's child is, we could bring pieces of the shattered, eggs shelter, back up our claim, and maybe lured into a trap of some kind or throw it into a violent rampaging ridge.

03:27:58

I'm thinking that we would know exactly what happened to its child and it would proceed to more of those. Well it's going to do that part anyways. Regardless of whether we try to reason with it, it could be a good strategy to at least, get it on the ground in front of us so that we all have opportunity to fight it before it can fly or burrow.

03:28:18

No, it's still pretty convinced. The dragons can see through lies in there for like, nah. I mean it's it's not a bad urban legends shoko. Here's that. And let's see, let's see if let's see what i know about dragons. Let's see what our two knowledge it has has zero rolled on dragons.

03:28:40

He did we just had a a small class on dragons. So it is an adult dragon you've garnered from the description's noise collected from a couple of survivors. Uh, it has an aura of cold ability. So anyone that's within 10 feet of, it will take damage. Uh, it does not have freezing fog it has, it can shape ice and snow at will

03:29:12

Uh, and constantly has spider clam effects. Basically, for any icy surfaces and see perfectly well, in any snowy condition? And i dropped. It's basic combat abilities in the discord because i really want you guys to understand the danger. You're going into because the dragon fight should be a dragon fight.

03:29:39

Okay yeah. Plus 20 to hit plus 19 to okay. Okay. Um, but since he is only a, an adult white dragon, you don't have to fear too much of his spell casting abilities. He's only got first level sorcerer cells because he's a white dragon. You know the question then becomes.

03:30:03

What are they? Oh there's following me putting up. My bone is there because all these do bludgeoning damage,

03:30:14

But don't not don't bites and claws. Do all three kinds of damage bite. Yes, uh, wings are bludgeoning, tail. Slap is also legendary and claws. Are slashing bites bts, correct.

03:30:40

Oh, gee writes as well. And then writes a letter to his parents. And who do you think is going to deliver that the wind? I think we killed kids representative. I'm gonna leave it here in unaimo and then the next person that comes through, that's going back to the intercity.

03:30:58

Um, i'm gonna have them try and send it back the way i came to get to minkai. No problemable.

03:31:11

So here's the fight part. There is no point in me, trying to blind it. No, that you you mistake yourself. That's not the funny part. That's not funny at all. I don't make it to save it. It's not even the don't make the saved. It's fucking dragon.

03:31:35

Us and yeah the full attack is. It gets all of these not just too too claws in the body. It's all of them. It, it do be like that. It dragon do gonna dragon malability dragon gonna dragon. The the only way to get around, this really is to do scummish tactics.

03:31:59

Don't think i'm gonna succeed in making the dragon. Make any saves huh? The dragon's probably have very good saves. Yes. I mean, do you like targeting reflex as a rule of thumb because large things? Nope, literally no reflex face. Not really standard. Barred thing. The reflex saves. I mean, i've got burning hands.

03:32:28

I've got i've got fireball, i'm not gonna throw it at thread. Any of my, uh,

03:32:39

Um, so circle says that he thinks he's the only person in the group who might last more than a turn in combat with this thing. If i throw up a mirror image and that's about it,

03:32:54

I was about to say something, but that's really mean. And i'm not going to tell sons that until after the combat because that's real me. Oh god, the dragon can see through mirror image. Can't hit if it does a specific thing by raw? Yes. Um, i don't know how to play dragons.

03:33:21

I mean, i can be, i can be nice and just tell you if you really want to know, it's it's the old like this sounds incredibly stupid. And then you remember. Oh wait, no, no, that makes sense. Because you remember how mirror image works because it overtly relies on a particular sense being the one you're using?

03:33:44

Oh it's the dragon closes the ties. It won't be seated. Well. Okay, exactly. It's the same thing. That means that no matter what i do, like any kind of stealth is just not going to look because dragons are smart enough to do tactics like that, even white dragons who have intelligences above 10 in Pathfinder.

03:34:08

If it was like, i don't know. Like a, okay, what's uh, what's the, what's the, not a worms? But the other one that juvenile is it like like young juvenile thing? Oh sure. No, i a young one. I didn't. I didn't mean like now they're, they're dumb but an adult one.

03:34:28

Like an actual. Oh no. Now, very let's let's not even forget that. I can pinpoint with its scent. Like there's a lot of stuff. Dragons, dragons are fucking hard. They're supposed to be, i got lying for a dragon is impossible so i don't know why we're trying.

03:34:51

Just a new copious amounts of violence and apply grace into it.

03:35:00

For once. I am not joking. Racing will be helpful and possibly game changing at all. Depends because this thing also has the highest ac of anything you fought yet. So we we play uh we play put everyone single one of us as a meat shield in front of grace and

03:35:26

We are, if i can somehow somehow managed to get like one full of time, attack of like sneak off, that thing will have no way. See.

03:35:46

I mean, how much of it is natural 17? Every time i hit, i reduced it by full. Yeah, which is why it's impossibly. He's got a hip, i would i would die in the next one. Of course, like the second. You started fencing that dragon. You were that dragon's now.

03:36:07

So focus. Yeah, i know i've been sitting here listening to this the second that Grayson gets off a full round of arrows on the dragon. He's gonna be the full book. Yes, so yeah but Grayson also has the highest Asian i believe. So i'm not concerned. I mean he's like seeing that high friends like 29, it's it's pretty high.

03:36:35

It does mean the dragon we'll have to roll them. Yeah, exactly higher than 50.50. It's like, well. All right. You guys have a week to plan and discuss options for the white dragon battle, feel free to communicate in channel. I will get something posted in the rp channel and we'll say that happens previously.

03:36:57

I mean, we come across the dragon immediately use the box. Yes, i'll be getting used and the box will probably invalidate a lot of everything. Except i mean probably can we barry Abby in the snow can the dragon see through? Solid snow can have he breathe through solid snow.

03:37:23

That's also a very fair point. I mean, if it can burrow it probably has tremor sense. That's true.

03:37:34

Uh, so traversense i doubt. But i would go on record to say that white dragons have an affinity for i quote, what was the present used earlier and see through snow and other associated things like no problem. Um, i'm just gonna say that, right? I thought i was just like, they don't like blizzard and some shit.

03:38:00

I didn't realize. I imagine it is potentially blizzards but unfortunately the wording on it says a white dragon designs ever. Any penalties to perception checks while in snow which implies. But you can see through snow. What a bitch also like again dragon senses dragon senses don't give a fuck.

03:38:30

In part time when it's only dragons don't give up. Anyway, is it too late to roll up the? Is it too late to roll up the bear guy from the fortress? I mean he's he's already rolled up, you know what i'm saying to what's right him in because i don't like i'm sitting here.

03:38:51

Like what is OG do against a dragon? What is until you're right now? If no guys from likes being mode by a fucking dragon, she'd be like that is such a cool way to go and then i being these vindictive asshole, i'm about to give her a level and that one medium class that allows you to come back from the dead by possessing your own body.

03:39:14

She's just gonna be like, yeah because he has to roll a natural one to miss me with the bite. And then it doesn't get a whole lot better from there, so i can't stand next to him. And if he's not an ownie that i'm sneak attacking i'm gonna do like 26 plus like two plus like one.

03:39:40

So i'm going to do like six damage. So my what's what's your ac currently? Like you're bases that you would have in the situation? 22. Okay. So you you have more than three ranks in um acromatics right. Yes. Okay, so if you total defense, it was 28. Um, if we find some way of further, increasing your ac and he wearing any armor, oh, she is not, he gets his charisma to armor.

03:40:18

Well, then guess what? You're getting major, you get charisma directly to honor. It's not dodge, right? Yes, it's untainted it's untyped so it but sometimes oh my godrama will help you. Then so by doing a total defense auction, yes you don't get to attack but you do withstand the envelope.

03:40:40

Should you choose to do? So, um, doing that, then i know you have bar umbrella. So barren brawler to come shattered results so that you can gain 10 heritage pay. Yeah, then, um, here was here, was my temporary plan to spoil it. I'm gonna drop this in here for you, too.

03:41:03

Just so that you have those tactics or you're just gonna give us that. Like that's i pretty much did give you that. I'm just copying and pasting it now. Yeah, that was basically explained. I mean, approaches the hog clouds is a sentence.

03:41:24

And this is my earlier question of least, so we're not going to be able to see. It's going to be fly by attacks and then if we get it on the ground, it's going to burrow. And then Grayson's gonna get one full attack on it at some point. And then it's going to roll up on grace into trying full attack Grayson.

03:41:46

But i was gonna borrow umbrella into spring attack for this fight and just do one attack per round burning, a key point to get as many feet as possible to just try and stay away from the dragon. No, that isn't exceptionally good tactic. It is a really sound tactic.

03:42:05

What is the one? I would be doing if i had about umbrella. Yeah, well because i get there is there's one blog with the the gorilla tactics and that will is probably going to be on me to get around if you're moving in and out of these ranges of each other all the time, you're not going to be grouped up for koya.

03:42:25

Yeah, so she's gonna have to be bouncing around two for healing but she can do it. She's got the travel domain. It's all going to be on grace and i'm gonna try to say out of it break. Oh, you'll. It'll turn you into pudding. Yeah, it'll turn me the fucking funny.

03:42:44

Okay. You're gonna have to do the um, what i'm gonna professionally refer to as the plaster method, which is you look at what your range is on average and you go to the end of it and you live there. Now, you make a house you erect an entire mage tower.

03:43:01

You put in a change of address form with the postal service because that is that's where you live now. That's why you live now. That's a good book. Also, you might have a better chance of fighting her in her layers, so that she cannot make fly by attacks over you.

03:43:20

Yeah. Burrow attacks only, which is it great. But at almost argue would be worse. It was Grayson can attack something. I mean not so strong. Did anybody give us any sort of radius on where might be making its home? Because of like you know where it's clear is they do.

03:43:42

Yeah, you're sending a scout to give you directions. They really making that guy do that. Hey, he volunteers to do that. If it's gonna save his the rest of his village

03:43:57

Uh yeah, every talking man aritake protection plan. Uh, ochi. Yeah. Now, it's on the list of to have two people that have made armor other box. I mean, that's the thing though. Um, as long as he's not full attacking me, if he hits me with a bite, he's gonna hit me with the bite, but that's i won't lose, you know?

03:44:27

I can take like three turns of him running up on the inviting me before i start to be really, really worried. That's what i was talking about with spring having to chase you and only getting one by the tag. Is the optimals situation? Exactly. And that's why i'm probably like the problem.

03:44:45

I'm gonna be springing attacking so that he has to move. Every time i can get in him once as hard as i can and get out. Goodness, the shade. Yes.

03:45:02

I mean that's basically just so i can contribute, everybody else has better options for this except for maybe no way. It's going to have to do the same dance that i'm going to do. I i am gonna not be able to do your dance. That's the problem. I have, yeah, nothing that i typically do is go into work in this fight.

03:45:20

No. You know, who's going to collect the eggshell fragments in a separate bag.

03:45:29

Uh, because that might be a way to draw her attention in the middle of the fight. Like once, yeah, you can disrespect her and maybe get her focused somewhere, uh, for a turn. That's not a terrible idea. Well, that's fantastic idea. And i will totally let that work. Oh dude, i did not take the tunic from the loot list.

03:45:48

That is excellent point. Is anybody have a problem with me? Taking the tunica? Deadly mite. No, it was for you, the summarize specifically taking the thing for the sunrise in order to be a better samurai, why would be like? It's my shows of code of the night wind. I mean that session?

03:46:06

I got told like, fuck off, you've taken like everything on this fan. I was like, okay cool. Because you did but it sounds everything now. So that we don't have this conversation. There we go.

03:46:22

He is but we all have access to big problem but we're not nobody's talking about uh how do we deal with the breath weapon? Yeah, it's gonna eat up her against spelled slots though. So we actually want to stay group up to try and bait it into using it for reflection.

03:46:47

You will never run out her bubble button. Well, yeah, but it's better that she uses that instead of the bullet arc. Technically correct. I hate first un, unless she is one of those quick retarded dragon. What you're gonna be? I thought dragons. Oh that's fair. Yeah i've done that too.

03:47:15

Yeah i hope dragons could have been left. All right, so resist energy communal is oh it's third little spell fantastic. I assume she's seventh level so it would be cold. Resist 20.

03:47:32

It was correct. Whichever did not set with any of the resistance that you might have also correct. Yep. 20 20s better than the five that i have. Wow, imagine having resistances. So i mean since it's also above the damage more panicking about this and either, this is going to go really well.

03:47:56

It's going to go absolutely terrible. I know i can't imagine it could go. That badly thing store. Silver. Dragon friend, it really depends on how many turns it takes them to turn. I'm just gonna point over at the fact that mythic paladin got one rounded by a mook with a fucking orcax.

03:48:16

I don't trust this game anymore. I went also like should point out that in the air. Silver dragons are the superior combatants on the ground. The white dragons can take them. It's silver dragons. Don't have.

03:48:41

There's a reason they have an epic conflict in the crown of the world.

03:48:53

Not what's our strategy for when the dragon doesn't get around? Jump like when an elevator falls and hits the bottom of the shaft. We jump at the last minute. Yeah, yeah.

03:49:09

Um, how many portions of fly? Do we have? Ah, i think We don't have any access to we have access to. I have one, but the pushing the flag from in Caliat, i mean, i do have the five spell but i didn't i wouldn't know. Outpoint because i didn't i have got two people cast that lie on grayson racing.

03:49:49

Does a full attack the dragon immediately identifies grayson as the greatest threats grace and stays in the air, we call the silver dragon in the silver dragon. Get to fight the white dragon in the air.

03:50:02

And act like fireballs at it.

03:50:09

Kind of hate that. I give you that idea. Yeah, so now it's brilliant idea how my mindset has gone from. Like i'm slightly concerned about this encountered to being like, i could just not be here next session, and you'd be fine. So and never mind thumbs up.

03:50:32

Like this idea. I like this plan. All right, we may be going directly to the mid boss next week then and just kind of gloss over the white jacket. If this words,

03:50:50

Encounter it outside of its layer.

03:51:00

Who asked if i had haste?

03:51:06

Because it's only way in talking in and find Richard. I assume that that would be uh that would be Grayson right throughout line. Okay. Yes. I do have pace that i could get anything like that as well. Again. Well no you guys are very welcome to fight the dragon and if things go south summon, the silver dragon, i think you guys can do it.

03:51:36

I was under the impression that forever house that box probably isn't going to be using the word. If in that sentence just i, you get you gave us like a Joker. Will pass the box off to no way. Nowhere will throw it back to you. Well, like, look the first round of combat.

03:51:59

We all have something we're doing shoku. Will throw on bardic performance grace and will be unleashing. Hell akoya will be buffing the party. Oh, she will be taking the total defense action. And so what's knowing chugging potions and probably activating the mark that keeps trying to kill me. But thanks for asking.

03:52:21

Okay. Then, i guess if you guys are okay, but delaying barter performance by going around, i guess, shut up. It could take blocks. You can give it to me. Hold up her hand. Oh, princess is right over there.

03:52:36

She's the one who's actually most equipped to actually lack the phone. You should have actually come into physical altercations of us. I may be better off using a bow. If there is a way that i could get my hands on a bow that would do damage to the dragon, it all like, i don't think a mundane one like master worker plus one at least would probably be required, but that's going to be better than.

03:52:59

I mean, if you really want me to before we leave, i spent in arcane point. I cashed greater magic weapon on my crossbow, and island. You might crossbow. What's the reload at a crossbow? I was hoping to do something. Maybe just cast it on his bow instead of your crossbow.

03:53:18
