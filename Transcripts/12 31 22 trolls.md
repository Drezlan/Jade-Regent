00:03

Or whatever. I'll start there. Anyways. Um, we inspected his layer with the help of the, the one, the lady, the second in command of the village, i forgot her name. Oh, and we found a few things. We found, uh, we found the shattered, egg shells of the white dragon.

00:26

Yes. Yes, my entirely. Yes, yes, dergen Durgin happened. We found the shattered. Egg shells and we think he did that to piss the dragon off to make it attack the village for some. We don't know why we think that he was under command of some lady who was like, painted on the walls, he seemed to be obsessed with.

00:55

Um, we gathered that she is living in a tower like is is, it's it's it's bad. Juju, like it's people, don't go there, it's a bunch, it's part, it's one of a bunch of towers. Uh, what was it called? The forgotten spiers, the isolated spiers, the nameless fires, the name was okay.

01:26

That's just slightly ironic. That is, yeah, that is actually, yeah, that's pretty good. Um, what else did we find on the walls? I don't think we found anything else on the walls all the time. I think we found illustrations of the obelis that are popping up all over the place.

01:51

Yeah, we just. Okay, so we did find that. Uh, and so we told her what had happened. Uh, and we took off for the dragon's layer. We got to the dragon's layer, we parked up outside of an obelisk next to a novelist, uh, killed, someone dead, uh, lured her down to us with an illusion.

02:16

And then um, uh, that that was certainly a fight that happened. That was certainly one of the fights of all time.

02:31

We called the silver dragon to help us and he failed us out of that bullshit fog and we managed to kill the dragon. All right. Uh then in a wonderful sequel to how we handled the incubus and wrath we just left him there next to the necromantic obelisk and went on to his lord for her horn, brother.

03:00

Um yep. And then shoko went to get a like people to help get the hord out of the dragon flare, which was like in a hole in the wall. So like he's gonna go get like people to like set up ropes and pollies and shit. Uh, and while he was doing that the dragon skeleton attacked the rest of you guys.

03:23

And i don't know how that part one because i was gone.

03:30

Honestly, it went, it went on. Um,

03:38

By, uh, the zero's got like just did the have the misfortune of being the mage without grow. Um, some very fun and uh, events involving dimensional side. But other than that, i believe i got two rounded. I,

04:06

It made the mistake of being too big and people having too many attack actions.

04:17

That's about all. I remember.

04:29

I mean, it sounds pretty good. Unless anyone else has anything, they think they miss.

04:38

And looking at ochi who i haven't heard a word from hello, good afternoon. Um, i'm a bird. I dragons. There was two dergens. We did a fight against some dergens. We fought one twice. That's, we did all that. That's all true. You're usually the one that remembers something wacky.

05:02

I usually am but it's been a little bit and i haven't been notetaking. Like i was um the entirely sure. Let me, i'm trying to think if there's anything. Extra spicy that happened.

05:18

Found some stuff. We got the stuff. Yeah, i have nothing.

05:29

He didn't, she didn't have quite the horde. Yeah, we got some pretty. I don't remember what it was all to. Look at chat. What did we get?

05:42

All right, then we resume, we shoko. Arriving at the dragon's lair. Few character things before we move on, if that's all right. Um,

05:57

Oh, that's the wrong place. Um,

06:04

Oh yeah. Um, i'm taking a signature performance. Is there a way that i can like tell the cell table that i'm taking that instead of one of the spells i get for this level? Remove it and then add the spell. I don't know. I don't know how casters work so well, i mean it's not it's not the end of the world.

06:29

It's just, it's just that my third little, small slots are going to say you can learn one more spell forever.

06:42

I'm pretty sure if you just start a, um,

06:49

I there's an option that's something on the lines of like, spell spots or something. You just turn that off and then you just add like, give one for the right.

07:02

Other way to do that, i know there is do it tomorrow. I also need to actually spend a few minutes selecting my third level so that i get because i selected one last time, but i just learned that it isn't by day. Fourth level focus, I selected. So i need to be choose if you want to recommendation.

07:24

Yeah sure. Good help.

07:33

Good.

07:37

There's a classic third level style that is not east that is very good for us but it's also good for this particular kind of party. I am being incredibly biased. I suggested no, this is really good. Yeah, i'm taking that i'm absolutely taking that that's crazy. Um,

07:57

I'm going to enter in theme with your your, you know, drum ally boosting thing. So i'm also taking blazing Rondo. So,

08:11

I'm going to be a party buffing machine.

08:34

Also got an extra. First of all, i apologize to read pretty late anyway. Yeah, we're actually just getting started. Oh,

10:16

So while we're waiting on showcode to finish that up, let's pick up where we left off.

10:28

Oh yeah. Yeah, i'm i'm finished. Sorry. I didn't you're making noises. So, it sounded like you were doing something. Oh, i i am. I thought you guys would actually like, you know, she'll go just arrives. The dragon skeleton is dead. Anyone gonna mention the dragon skeleton attacked her, choco i would like to be refreshed on.

10:55

Why Shoko went back to the caravan to pick up weigh-in and the others to just? Yeah. Wayne has our bag and also, oh, for the little. Yeah, i was and i was also gonna get like, everyone's help to like set up a system to get stuff out of this hole in the wall.

11:15

That's true because we got to like, carry it up.

11:22

That is just going to start really dismembering what's left of this skeleton. Until there is no way, no how that it can come back as an actual complete, just start kicking the bones to opposite ends of the cave. Um, i think seems Yeah, i guess i guess. She'll go walking on this and, uh, takes a look at the skeleton and his eyebrows.

11:51

Enter his hairline. Um, okay. Uh, you guys uh you guys have fun without me. There he wanted a rematch and then you got apparently, he liked, he wanted my face. Sorry, she wanted to be match. You did blast them with fire. Go go. Grimace this is this. I am.

12:22

Oh shit. My bad. The others are outside. Um, Let's see. Pops over to the rest of you. So, oh god. How did this struggle locks up the bones and things? And, Oh god damage because we left it. Nice to the office, isn't it? Leaving on that things, on that things, dead things.

12:57

Next to the next eye of terrible. Necromantic power or could possibly go wrong, pre undead. Okay, just puts his head runs his hands through his hair. Uh, we we need to not let down our guard like that.

13:24

Happen. But i'm not the magic person.

13:35

We're all magical in our own way, okay?

13:45

You get a bone? Loved it here. Was that a was that way in as he shows up. Oh, okay. Yeah, yes.

13:56

I said. All right. Kid. Just because your mom said that you're special doesn't mean we all are. Oh, cheap. How'd you know that my mom said, oh, let the kid believe what he wants.

14:13

What have we got and chuckle, those stuff forward to examine the room, the dragon and the tractor. It's a recently. Risen white dragons. Very recently, you can practically taste the necromatic energy off of it as the dirtiest thing that you are familiar with these things.

14:42

And yes, like you already concluded likely caused by the model. If?

14:51

We're gonna, we're gonna need a way to stop that from happening. We don't know how much of a range. Those weird obelisks have, and who knows how long, how far we would have had to haul? This things corpse to keep it away from it. It seems like so far the laws of this world, only let these things rise.

15:15

Uh, one time after being originally killed because the skeletons or the undead that we fought earlier diet fairly easily. And then this, whether it's out of range or not, i think obeyed the same sort of procedure. Oh yeah, absolutely most undead oh you don't, you don't really see them becoming undead.

15:39

They don't get too chance of this free undead for the most part. I don't know how this works. Both of the other dead. The other dead dragon time of home image and it apparently i might be out of the range later and personally, aren't we at the bottom of the hold right now?

16:02

No, that was something we could actually go check out and i think grace and mentioned last time wanting to go down and scope that out. Also.

16:12

Or no way on the wall. Well, i brought men and i brought rope and pitons and all that good stuff. So we could get us down there. Shall we go investigate? I think there's a story to be told here.

16:37

Uh, looking at the button and just kind of once it's on. There's like i heard climbing down stuff. Fine. Am i able to convince like some of the boys, to some of the strapping young lads traveling with us, to come down with me into this dragon layer? Or are they all like, no.

16:57

No, it's just a little clown. I with claimer's kids. Yes, they will go down.

17:15

Um, you know, it's safer to do this stuff with the with people, with like as many people. So to like you know have hold onto the ropes and all that. Yes but essentially are we going to go down and check out the other dragon? Skeleton lower down the chasm.

17:33

Back out of this cave to the original giant thingy. You and i are the only one saying anything about it. So, i just wanted to make sure that everybody else was down to spend time doing. That also did you. I remember someone actually going down there. Yeah, i don't remember what we needing.

17:52

What was down there?

18:00

Well, i was another dragon. Yeah, the only thing i remember you mentioning is the skeleton hands of what you need to be aim of a dragon. Yeah. And the only thing that was found down there was that the wounds on the dead dragon were made by another dragon. Oh yeah, i'm sort of domestic.

18:24

A domestic dispute then uh, could be. It's always the husband, 100% of the time, you got her hoard, you found the nest where the eggs used to be.

18:48

So, or just gonna say a prayer over this double dead dragon, and then also walk over and say, some nice poetry, like stuff for the smashed up eggs. Show. Go takes those three big shells and puts it back in the nest.

19:21

Well, let's load up our sick. Loop the way Ann come down here. He's got group bag group storage, okay? You carry the stuff and i'll carry you.

19:35

Uh, so can we get more like the the cavern thoroughly? We discussed that a little bit last time. I don't think there was anything else to find over in the top. Yeah, you you found you found everything? That's the eggs. This is the bath slash lazy river. This is the storage unit.

20:02

This is the event storage unit. This is the foyer. Yeah, we scoped it all. We got our sick glue. I think we can just go somewhere, less, murdery with less on dead stuff.

20:22

We can go back and tell people they're uh their homes are safe now.

20:31

That is for sure. You can. Yeah. And that was the other thing. I was trying to get people for us to help us all this dragon course.

20:54

Casually tie it to the root of the camera, like a deer.

21:07

Already. Yeah, i was heading down the i-10 just jumped right out in front of my truck but i couldn't couldn't swap him down.

21:21

You return to a kalya and triumph the uritaki hail you with mighty heroes, and hold a great feast of caribou goat and fish taken from the riverlands, during the beast chief nowanock. And so on some of the boot take you aside, we've studied the pictograms in tenure explore and we believe we figured out more of what he was planning.

21:51

Ancient tales say that the moroseco's were the growing scourge wielded by the demon lord's scissod. Who ate the flesh of the dead and bound their bones to serve him in ages past the three finger skull will cause his mark and the pictogram that suggests that the dark winged woman.

22:14

May have found some way to reclaim the demon lord's ancient the power. Perhaps using this change black monoliths or other ancient magics discovered and inspires, we believe that the third pictogram shows a place that we call the storm tower names because of the strange swirls and storm that is constantly about it.

22:46

You may stay here and rest as long as you wish, but if this woman continue causing trouble, all of the north could be in danger, she seems to be in your path that she does. You believe the woman is at this storm tower and that is that one of the things that we heard of before there was like the three tower thingies, we believe it was made by the same people who made the nameless spires but it is far away from the crown.

23:20

It is next to the alabasterine peaks. Can we get a look at the map? Or can i get a direction? That that is here. Okay. So the nameless fires are all like literally right here where all the act, the complete north of the world. The storms fire is overhero, right?

23:50

Actually, i think we were told about that one, previously. Weren't we? Yes. Okay. Uh, i may have given you that information a little early. Oh, yeah, that's right. You had son of root down there with you. Yeah, so she was able to see them then. So the name was so the name was spiers aren't connected to this then if she's not at them, do not know.

24:19

But the storms fire is, none of the crown.

24:36

Wow, it's certainly on our way and most likely blocking our way.

24:45

Especially, i mean we knew we were gonna have to deal with the storm eventually man. More than a feeling that this is connected to that. What can you tell us about the storm's fire other than where it is?

25:09

Not much it is constantly surrounded by a storm. My people do not go. There we prepared ourselves for the, the journey across the crown much, um, equipment for the terrain and the weather. Are there any other obstacles or things that we might face that we might be unprepared for that?

25:33

We could possibly better equip ourselves to deal with.

25:41

Just to continue along the path. Hmm. Yes, we will make sure although your wagons are are well outfitted before you leave and please take these and she gives you a sashimuno of comfort and two fully charged ones of a door elements rad.

26:12

I thought she want to go comfort.

26:22

Just put that on though, she

26:34

If i'm thinking of the right sachin monitor, those are the press my legs, right?

26:45

There. We can stick it on the caravan, there's a number of ways you can carry it, but it gets. Um and it keeps people comfortable and extreme weather conditions. We have our banner indoor elements.

27:03

So with those nothing just, you know, so you can equip it to a caravan and that entire train will get the benefits of the i know. But no is being facetious.

27:23

Look. Dude, everybody knows that if you put a tapestry up, everything gets more chill.

27:35

This i'm gonna i'm trying to roll back on the jokes in this manner but i am gonna say this is like for sure. Like a Bob Marley tapestry or like a sublime tapestry and like, a frat house.

27:51

All right. That was my one for for the next 20 minutes. Uh, that's rad, though, we get that. So all of our i got like a whole crew. Now, everybody's gonna be warm enough. So oh you'll also be going out into the boreal expense. Yeah, i was about to ask.

28:14

So, from unaimo all the way and, like, along our path, choco traces, it with a finger. When do we next hit civilization?

28:30

Month of the wall of heaven.

28:37

You might find some more villages in the mountains and the ridges, but true civilization not till you get to Tian.

28:54

Is it all right? If we rest here before we head out, we've been through a lot today.

29:02

Oh uh, small settlements. All and corn and jogging we might stay for a few days just to give them. You might know the caravana break after and before we make them, check out all such a fucking on such a bleak journey devil rests as long as we need to to get prepped for this.

29:32

But i think we should just try and get across around the storm and going nowhere. Yeah. Well, let's uh, ain't going nowhere. But so here's the thing about going into the boreal expanse. Oh my deep, 100 rolls. Now get plus 50 to them. Dangerous dangerous. He sounds so excited.

30:10

It's been it's when the dm somebody dm's really? I mean taizo um take one look and go fuck it. Encounters. You're going to have them, you're going to have them. I don't know where my accent went halfway through that. I'm so sorry. Um, but yeah. Uh, i also should very quickly just while i well, i want to apologize anyone to stop hearing explosions.

30:39

Um, it isn't working that i will. Yeah, so my neighbors might not. I don't know why it's fucking raining, but you guys do that in Britain too, huh?

30:55

It is very much, a global thing i thought. I thought it was. Uh yeah, it feels a very american thing to celebrate with explosions. Yeah you need to look up on fire night so before you get, i know you're probably looking at tables this up but before you get super carried away with how you're going to kill us, can we mark some rests on our character sheet at least one night of rest?

31:25

Please continue your logistics though. Now we we go, no rush, no sleep, no sleep. So tension which i think would actually kill us. So don't listen to me. It, it would, it would actually very likely kill you. Okay, i apologize. I'm back. My dog. Who's giving me that look like him.

31:52

I need out. It happens. So we got a um like a call of duty clan logo flag. What does it say on here? I think it's like, um, Decorated with three stylized orchid flowers. Actually, so that gives us a der elements on the whole caravan if we plant it on the caravan and then some wands and we rested one night and i think we're gonna head out onto the boreal expanse, on our path to get to the other side, to go to the wall of heaven.

32:29

And we're going to stop by the storm spire and just do a quick, you know, solve everybody's problems. And you think quick stop, everybody solve in the problem. Problem solve and the problem be solved with murder. No one else can solid prom. So we have to with murder with with murder looks the crown concerningly.

33:08

Don't try and solve book one with.

33:21

I'm sure the random jerk that the monk just punched in the face, isn't actually. Okay, transfigured. Ancient dragon.

33:34

Bait. Light just uh, Justin, nothing. Okay.

34:07

Continue on, while the fence moves in my sleep, i'm not murdering anyone. I was asked to give you a few. Yeah. Yeah, i'm just over here killing like doing artwork stuff. Like, i'm gonna make this look so cool for them. Like this time to kill us. No no no no i don't forget about the car with that.

34:35

I think it was something had made up, but if you're dragon, oh yes, good night. What did you say? I missed most of that and then i got pulled back in a weird time. Abby was abby and me were joking about a solving all of your problems of violence and how bad of an idea that is.

34:58

And um, i i said something the effect of that's when the dm makes the random jerk that the monk just punched in the face for no reason. Actually transfigured. Ancient dragon. Yes.

35:14

10 out of 10 would do this negative 5 out of seven. Please don't.

35:26

Sometimes you just get those players that just need to be taught a lessons. Yeah, but that's what strength of thousands is full. Thank you. I'm here.

35:46

And i'll have, you know, your first encounter and the boreal expanse is, snowcaster elves. I genuinely thought you were going to say, yes, more dead, every time.

36:16

And they are not a bad encounter.

36:26

They go. Um, well before we move on, we should probably do shopping because we just got the dragon sword. And this is going to be the last bit of civilization for many sessions. You know what? That is. Totally fair. Let's just pop you back over to hell. Yeah, they have like ten dollars.

36:46

We've done this like three times. I thought you said that the last time, the reason they didn't have anything was specifically because they're civilization level was like four lower because of the dragon. Yeah, it does jump back up. Once you guys have dealt with the dragon and if you rest there for a few days, we'll say the trade has made its way to the town once more.

37:29

Well crap. Let me go get the colors. That's tell me what removing hunted does now. Okay, i will go to the website and find out what we're moving. I did those.

38:36

Okay, to do.

38:44

Economy, law and society, minus four, danger, plus 20 reduced space value by 20 percent. Okay, so it does a lot actually.

39:19

I'll be right back. Hold on. Do we have placed some communication with?

39:37

When you're gonna go.

39:42

Okay, when i get in situated and i get my clothes on.

39:54

I didn't see your message until just now, i'm sorry, i'm just seeing if you were even still here,

40:20

Out.

40:32

Hey, new stats for culia.

40:39

So, let me redo. Let me read you those items.

40:48

How much is exactly?

40:56

We come back and they just happen in the same chair. Just like, i don't know, no idea for life. I had put point in the, an annual background spills yet.

41:18

I think if i can figure out what language to pick up,

42:04

Okay. Weird. Why doesn't Leo have a character sheet under characters?

42:14

He does. It's there. It's just not set to be visible through the characters would be my guess.

42:32

There it is. So just to confirm looking at this, it just means they only have enough gold to buy five thousand gold worth of our loot. So, and is correct and a one week period, i believe.

43:15

So off by like uh five thousand gold worth of stuff. So everybody gets 1000 correctly with our goal to distribute. Everybody would get 2000 gold each to put on your sheet.

43:38

Oh yeah.

44:07

Can you put that a number in chat? Grayson.

44:29

The increase that by another thousand each uh dividing up some of the platinum as well. Could you put that number in chat? The total it was in the foundry chat. Not the discord chat. Oh, the discount. Okay, no, it's supposed to count. I can't understand no word. That's because pin dwarven.

44:57

You're gonna the language. They're gonna say was the number including the platinum. I'm sorry. I know we've talked about this three times now. It was another five thousand tall. It's not though because the language dwarvenge, they can't read it unless they speak to organ. No, i can't. It's three thousand gold pieces.

45:20

Each three thousand gold pieces each. That's a common.

45:28

There, it's in discord. That's so red. I can read that.

45:39

And is weird. Do i have dwarven? I had warm in the 25 minute. I still can't understand it. No string as speaking in a different language. For me. It's not uh, dwarven because i don't have dwarven. Holy go out. Might be glitching. The language thing is set to common.

46:09

Strange.

46:17

Regardless, i put it in the discord chat. It's 3k gold each.

47:06

Thank you.

47:34

Your newest items.

48:12

Wand of call lightning. That could be useful out in them crown, since i imagine most of our combat will be outside and we'll be in probably a in storms a lot.

48:36

You have 11 thousand spend on that.

48:44

Uh, it's a casual level five bond. What's the check to activate that? If it's not on the list, it doesn't matter. It's 20. Oh it's always 20. Okay. Yeah, ones have variableness but they're castle levels. Also typically varies, um, a lot more than normative.

49:08

Man, plus 20 the magic device. So i could use that anyone want to pull their money for a with level call. Lightning on.

49:21

What's the same on it?

49:27

Uh,

49:31

Can be a d315, oh, just 15. That's probably one.

50:14

Obviously, a single stroll.

50:21

One time list.

50:26

What is the scroll action, path?

50:37

Let's talk about, what about That's for how to suggestion even if it's not available. Um, take a look at the equal import spell creation rules. The differences, you're not making a custom spell. You're just going to go and ask our wonderful clinic uh how the fuck that works?

51:10

And do some studying. It's not like you don't have time seriously, 75% chance that you can find an arcane copy of it in the village.

51:26

You do in fact, find a copy of it in the village. Wait, i don't buy it.

51:36

Take your entire stock with 75. Remember number eight.

51:55

There is no reason.

51:59

I'm sure you guys will do what you need.

52:19

It's 150 my bad. The second battle scroll.

53:08

What's the maximum gold that we can look for go value?

53:14

Five thousand.

53:21

I found a drum that makes skeletons dance in place.

53:38

Yeah, by the way, we should probably be preparing specifically for um, like undead bench bang items here, not specifically, banging lately things to deal with. I'm dead because this if this lady is tied to these arrivals, for me can imagine that she probably has some amount of necromancy at her disposal.

54:10

That boobies and reasonable.

55:23

No, anyone else looking for things? For me to rule, are we all just shopping now? Um, it's not a bad idea clearly You have you have strong, empirical evidence that there will be undead in your path. I free. Did anyone have?

55:54

I don't think i'm gonna be picking anything up. Do it. Slowly weapon bomb. I was not another, i believed. No way was the one making the weapon bombs or buying them.

56:22

Um, i think i had one more dose made and we don't sweat of them all of this.

56:37

Why you won't take election of it? Commissioner, um yeah, i think specifically so it's best with them with arrows, right? So eventual price them. Yeah, it's what you can use it to go 10 pieces of animal at a time.

57:04

Yeah, how much 30 per so choker will just hand you the like, um, we'll say 150 gold for you to make five doses. She looks at the 150 gold and goes so you want 15 doses. All right. Yeah, if that wouldn't be too much time investment,

57:47

And gets what you mean for that. But um, would that take too much time, right? I don't know. Rules. Okay. Crafting all chemical weapons. Honestly don't wise i slept since then um it's not that bad.

58:33

Yeah.

58:41

Um, skeletons are taking much damage from year your sword. So maybe we should invest in like a handful of like, plus one masses.

59:03

I mean, i was just with punching. What about you? Yeah, i got this.

59:15

I was still just gonna stab him. All right, i'll buy a blanch if we need to buy it. This isn't that what you're working on? The only waterfall? Yeah. That's what we were just working on, huh? Okay. You guys think of anything off the top of your heads? Other than that, it would be useful here.

59:42

I have no big ideas.

59:49

Um, oh the fucking the thing that the ap keeps obviously expected us to have the uh wait no. The goggles are fog cutting. How much were those?

01:00:27

That um, i'm a prison to your answer, your question about how long it will take one dose, takes three and a half days

01:00:42

Uh, okay. Then we probably only have time for one dose or we could just buy them, can't we? 30 gold each. So yeah. What is it called? Took her around.

01:01:05

No reason not please.

01:01:13

The entire time she was using America for this punches.

01:01:28

Yeah, i i hate to be like like, um, you're worried mom sending you off to school here. Going like are you sure you remembered anything or you sure you didn't. You didn't forget anything in your room, honey. But like this is going to be the last bit of civilization.

01:01:42

We see for months, this is our last chance.

01:01:58

Yeah. What is the thing that you're buying to help with your weapon attacks against undead because i'll buy some also,

01:02:45

How much is often wood water.

01:02:55

Every five gold i want to say because that's how much we get the flexible. Yeah, and most priests that will uh still water at cost. I'll buy some weapon bombs, then you mark up 10%.

01:03:20

Leave stuff.

01:03:27

That's 25, gold.

01:03:47

I think i'll buy some if they have time, it still just a village. So,

01:04:03

Three or four is probably more make sensei. All right, and on their iron stomach choice considering no one here is a pathfinder. I don't think anyone has a weight binder. Oh, that's not something that's just available. Oh, i didn't. I didn't know. It was a 5.0. Exclusive thing before finder is uh basically the congratulations you made it through your induction.

01:05:15

Here is your refinder which is problems and technology that originally is based on what evidence is plenty technology. Yes. Yeah, please don't give us out to anybody. Also, you might get killed in certain cities for having it non-path. Finders use the ion gutland.

01:05:41

Incidentally, also, based off of the same technology from the ion imperative, but no one talks about that.

01:05:54

Prepared, literally all ion. Technology comes from the volunte Empire. Just want to learn the midst of them you're on on that subject. Um, because even like, even having played society videos, i'm still not entirely 100% on this but rules for resonance are but not every stone hazard. Residence. Right.

01:06:16

Hi, thank you. Everyone has a residence based off of its shape and the item. It's in. What am i thinking about? Because um i'm sure but there's a ways is is it like a the mechanical way of thumbs up your eyes going or something like it? It does learn some of them actually they have like one use shit and then they turn into a dull.

01:06:46

Great spear after it's used. Yeah, i seem to remember someone using um, like a resonance and basically like supercharged it and then yeah. And an important it. Yeah, yeah. There's some of the residences will do that. Some of them will not and not particularly well versed in the island.

01:07:09

So i think i've got it. Heard of them ever gonna be I'm gonna start so much. I want to somehow enhanced. My like means that don't anyone has the ability to do that.

01:07:44

Probably been watching the times there.

01:07:55

I remember of all of my caravan they have available. Okay, this is a i i think i can think and then you're going to pick up an iron gauntlet and a practice, pink. Longboard items. Give me plus four competence on one covers and burned check and plus 100 reflexes.

01:08:23

All right, so i am stone.

01:08:33

Yep, it's you found it just there. I am going.

01:08:46

Apparently, this village, it can just get fucking access to everything. Now.

01:08:55

Uh, you see a door to the, the end of the wandering fox and you're like, how they've got a portal dance along. Yeah, those are not seriously.

01:09:11

Saying, none of you could use it. Well, you carry the seal though?

01:09:25

From my evil, we have a bunch of bonuses against cold water right now, don't we?

01:09:42

I mean so long as you return, the vicinity of the sacriman Mercedes nest improvement,

01:09:59

Um,

01:10:21

It is 700 miles. That's the one. I was waiting for like because someone needs to ask you guys are like, oh we're going to immediately, we're gonna go to that. I'm like, it's not the time. I think i could make a bunch. Like, i can probably make enough bomb to make any living, then your voice about it.

01:10:53

Like,

01:10:58

Like a wax figure? Yeah, and a lot said that, i'm just

01:11:13

Needs, are you from your shopping?

01:11:41

How are we for food as a sandwich? Caravan for 700 miles for 20 people in a couple animals. Um, well, since you've managed to not really lose any of the caravan and i'm kind of handraving the tanger is doing. Awesome job. You're good. You also picked up excellent supplies, then they gave you some after you killed dragon.

01:12:12

You may have ransacked the houses and everybody encampments of their food but we're destroyed by the dragons because there's no reason to waste good food.

01:12:29

Yeah, it's very awful, very helpful as they died, but that salmon over there didn't do the murdering. So, we're gonna

01:12:50

I lied about my shopping. I almost forgot one of the single most important purchases in OG's career.

01:13:01

I need to buy a tango drinking jug so i can have unlimited on demand tea. Yeah, that one's gonna be a little harder. It's a magic, it's a magic tea jug man. It's a thousand gold but it's a tangus specific one. All right. All right. I'll roll for it.

01:13:25

That's fine. And by harder, i mean it's going to be a 60 percent chance to find one instead of a 75.

01:13:35

I'll let you roll you. Let me roll a d100, right? Endo is that these two on the right? That doesn't look like it is, how do i do this? One d100 just type it. Yeah, backslash roll. Wendy 100. That is a self role and a 37. How do i reveal it?

01:13:58

Like click on it, in the chat. Remember how to edit specific saves because i now have the phosphorus specific kind of report safe. And you do that in effect notes. I know that we've been playing by the rules and all the things that i want are done, but i feel that i've been bird racist did against several times.

01:14:23

When i wanted a mini me raven, nobody would let me get a raise in the orphan place and now i'm like, all right i'll settle for a tea jug. They're like we don't take two kindly to your kind around here. We don't have that kind of crap wanted to generate them in the place where Ravens are exclusively means and the plan of ninja that are trying to kill you.

01:14:51

Yeah. And then i lowered my expectations to the tea jug and they're like we don't do that here. I think you lowered your explicit. Expectations is the wrong direction. That's a racial specific magic item from a village of humans.

01:15:12

There, there's my appropriate gif.

01:15:21

All right. I'll just put that thousand gold back on my sheet but no you found it. You rolled under 60. Oh, it's reversed. Okay, i see what you're saying. Okay cool. I'm super, super stoked. Suddenly just reverse fat quickly. Yeah, that's that's why the reduction from 75% chance of finding it to 60.

01:15:53

Appointment. I have a way of making my weapon. Magical magic. Weapon greater magic weapon, magic weapon.

01:16:13

Yet again, it was really spring that. Narrative devices. It will not be stopped. There was only spelled yeah and time. Oh, i got this.

01:16:37

All right, oh, she's ready. He's got unlimited tea and some juice for stabbing skeletons.

01:16:49

And i have a very, very, very you're not even salty years again and like that phrasing. His own shatter.

01:17:08

So not not the other kind of naughty the neck revealing, that's the place to take up. I know i asked the question earlier, but we went back to ocean immediately afterwards. Where do i, where do i make these edits do? I says oh yeah. Uh, what is the ability?

01:17:32

Um it's a plus four to uh fort saves against specifically non-lethal damage and cold weather and then a plus one to reflex saves flat. So go to your pink, rom boy. I am, sorry, whatever it is. And once you've opened that up, go to train news. Okay, under changes, you'll see, you know, the flags lose dexter.

01:18:04

Is you have a book, then you'll see changes and then the app. Plus that's over on the right hand side. Give it a quick and hopefully you'll get a new road that says formula operator. Target modifier on typed. Okay. So, just put officially, how many days are we staying here before we depart so far?

01:18:27

I believe you're at a week. Currently cool in that week. Can i if noise feeling really nice or grayson? I believe, could you teach me how to punch stuff? Instead of this other thing that i used to do, ie improved unarmed strike.

01:18:52

I'm gonna hurt anything from graces. You're my top bud. No, that's here. Okay.

01:19:02

Well, i i won't teach you to punch things. I only teach to kick that. That's fine. I'll go to no way to learn how to punch the, we got hitmonlee and hit my channel over here.

01:19:19

Yeah, cool. So, and if i have a guy, if i know a guy who knows the thing, five days, 800 gold going to teach you how to punch and then just looks over your tea set telling limited tea. I actually have a ceremonial tea set and unlimited delicious tea.

01:19:40

We could do punching lessons offering is acceptable and tea every single day for a week straight. Is it good? See though? This is an important question, i think it is, but it might be like, you know, a tengo sort of strain. You'll have to try it. I mean, it's likely a youngsy and spicy of some kind.

01:20:04

Yeah, it's probably delicious. Yeah, so yeah. Okay. So the first thing you need to know punch, always be aware constant vigilance. If you can dodge a ranch, you can dodge a punch.

01:20:27

That's okay.

01:20:37

Um, and with that, i am ready.

01:20:44

Yay. Okay, i am also ready.

01:20:52

Okay. All right. Map of the crown, right? We already did your first encounter.

01:21:09

Was the first encounter now that i think about it. It's not faster rolls. No caster elves. You're very cool. Sleep. Actually unusual. I'm sure i'm not supposed to see them.

01:21:31

And you really don't and until they appear out of the snow approaching you

01:21:38

General to see what i know about snowcaster house. You can no locals for those that have it.

01:21:52

Why would i know anything about?

01:21:58

What they use fucking ninja tactics. That's why, of course.

01:22:24

That everyone. Oh, that is a lot of everyone. Uh oh g. You know, that snowcaster elves are elves that live in the north. They have a proclivity force then when ice. Uh, and they are very mysterious.

01:22:46

Makes sense to me. He'll go video and no way Jesus you all got over a 25. All right. Um i guess just open the snowcaster l like quickie page, you know, that they are called the illiberani. Uh amongst their tribes only a few people outside of the tribes know that, but since you are all apparently thesis written experts,

01:23:22

They are descended from elves that stayed uh on valerion. They did not flee, they are generally good-hearted, but cold and unyielding and do not like intruders peaceful travelers. Can usually pass through their territories unharmed. But often have to pay a toll when doing so. Some have claimed that they are nomadic demon worshiping cannibals, who can freeze the man's glove with the glance.

01:23:53

Oh no. We've met them already. Uh, they live in close knit, isolated tribal villages, often near ancient ruins or holy sites. They revere both home and family, and most developed among them worship in them. I've never known how to pronounce her name. Spin the lad blood Laura, in the bendela de la.

01:24:17

So, in ways that sharply averaged from the rest of all the society,

01:24:31

Uh they respect shows the force however and generally do not resort to violence unless provoked. Their centuries are talented survivalists and guardian skilled in using their environment to scare or kill the targets and carry messages. No, no reason. No, that

01:25:09

About it. With the, in my

01:25:33

In my entire audit of my own character sheet. Like last week any questions uh do they look friendly.

01:25:46

They have their weapons drawn but they're not ready. Uh, with mine. No let's check. Do i know what language? They're likely to speak. Choco does not speak Elvis. She looks to our bird polygon.

01:26:11

I don't speak Elvin, i don't think. Now it goes like leans up looks room going back to sleeping on top of the camera.

01:26:25

Oh, g elbows, choco like, you do the talking?

01:26:42

Looks actually um, yeah. Uh, uh, just tell them that uh, we're just passing through on our way to the wall of heaven. We need no trouble or disrespect. No, you speak Elvin. It is fine. I think he's just looks straight at Juzio. You are in the path of a red paging, ice troll herd.

01:27:19

You must prepare for battle. Oh, she's like watching this and he doesn't speak the language. He just nodding. This is going well. Tell him we need to prep his mouth. I don't know. Let me get some sort of.

01:27:38

Uh, you know, if you believe them or, you know, him just trying to get the general just as he telling the truth, or if you just fucking with

01:27:56

I don't know. I,

01:28:08

Sure. I mean you can roll but you see and hear the trolls coming after he says that. Oh, well. That's not good. Yep. Those trolls. All right, everyone, this truck. Oh, razor's voice. Battle stations. Got trolls on the way.

01:28:36

Can make a role specifically on. You said ice trolls didn't listen pelt. One last time, just sick the door for me.

01:28:56

Oh yeah, no warden. Not green warden.

01:29:08

Maybe they're new with adult.

01:29:15

Oh, grace and buddy. We are not. We are not bringing our best today.

01:29:43

Is initiative is rolling off the top of the caravan time where i'm going. Oh, swearing very loudly in our attacking like for mice and it's

01:30:07

Actually, where you at? I rolled uh, hope she's on there.

01:30:18

Oh, okay.

01:30:23

Video. Excuse me. Oh, does that are wolf? Yeah. Oh crap. Of course. No, i would be able. I'll be on the other side. That's where she likes to see. And this junction has basically like rolled off the thing. Landed on only the cavity and it just looked and got wild explicitous.

01:30:53

Oh you have a full vision of the trolls coming. Yeah, i can see that one there. Oh no.

01:31:09

But i'm going to pop well no, i'll just go ahead and hit it with a nice. Uh,

01:31:18

On the magical perfectly and it realized cagney was over there. Exactly going to be sleeping here.

01:31:46

This one correct. Yep.

01:31:51

The animation go out for anyone else. Yeah, yeah. Okay.

01:32:01

And i'm not like, you know, fastest step back and then my turn

01:32:34

Here.

01:32:55

Made them a stand for looking at coming back and

01:33:03

I couldn't be oh dear. This is when i tell you my platform is 12. Out.

01:33:18

Sorry. That's no warden's. Doing good damage though, one, two, three, four, five.

01:33:39

It's gonna recline my chair and I mean i was going to give you the benefit of the doubt. If you were close to a close enough, i was going to go hit through the greater than disability clouds. Nice to hear about woods Suncoasts. But this is the situation, we focus.

01:34:11

We have four diet graysons on our team.

01:34:30

Compare lid on us, how badly this is gonna hurt.

01:34:36

Well, i'm about to swing it. Abby with an ax. So potentially awful, haha.

01:34:49

Actually, how i can only imagine that. No, i still trying to do a head count, and then just turns around and hasn't even gotten up yet and her, there's just this ax

01:35:03

Don't worry, he'll hit you with an expert at some point. Well, i mean he's got friends for

01:35:23

Oh, gee

01:35:28

I see one over there, so Oh cheese gonna run up on him question, mark.

01:35:58

Yeah, something about like that. I don't like get him to do it now. What am i press enter?

01:36:10

Yes, we're doing that drawing or stabbers as we go. And and i'm gonna try and faint. It probably won't be there. Yeah, can you hear me? Knock knock. I see you moving but i don't hear you.

01:36:29

Yeah, on your own. Your icon isn't lighting up.

01:36:37

Holding.

01:36:53

This encounter actually would have been much scarier. It's a very beginning of this book. Oh, discord, two levels ago. Can you hear me now? Yes, no crazy. Uh, so he moves there, i think that's well within my movement i'm going to try and faint the troll if he could swing on me before i get there.

01:37:10

I'm just gonna have to take it because i want to get that far. Listening on you before you get there. That's fine. A little bit faint. He's like animal intelligence, right? How smart are trolls, as i miss, you have a nine intelligence so he's smart enough to be fainted is very much smarter than a fever did.

01:37:32

So, and it's so trolls a humanoid. That's there's like the minus four, the minus eight or whatever they are large humanoids. Yes, with the giant and cold subtype. Wow. That was terrible. I'm gonna assume that doesn't beat his. What is it bmd? Yeah, don't do it. That's okay. We're still gonna stab him.

01:37:54

It's okay. He missed you with his ex. Well, that was to faint him. So i wasn't acrobatic thing too. Yeah, no, he rolled the 20 on his battle. Like stack he missed? Yeah.

01:38:13

We're going to swing one at him and just regular i guess bruh. That's a miss. And that's my turn. That's much. I'm going to take him to drop them off the cars. All right? To the movies. That brings us to this ice troll. Where are you gonna take him now?

01:38:39

Then what's going on the store? Okay, so if you do, okay, i'm not going to the movies. I'll be back after this. We're going to charge.

01:38:57

I'm it's fair. He has reach.

01:39:10

Not that this has beneficial to me in any way. Just just gonna put that right there.

01:39:21

All right.

01:39:38

Wait, what?

01:40:06

Like cool.

01:40:22

Very worried.

01:40:37

About her. Oh, g.

01:40:50

And if a lot of damage. Oh okay. Yeah, okay. I see why that's a lot of damage.

01:41:03

Oh no way. Why do you have damage? Who damaged? You, you did my AC flat foot is 12. Oh, i didn't consume the 13 minutes. No.

01:41:24

Um, surprising. Absolutely fucking nobody. Nobody's fucking right off. Let's, let's just not.

01:41:41

Um, and is going to move however,

01:41:55

And then i was another standard action. I'm, i'm not going to do it. Nope, we're not doing that young. Don't see numbers thumbs.

01:42:15

That's my turn. Two. Thumbs way out that we cannot see comes up from me a player. But i fully expects all of these to be dead before my time comes up. Anyway, but underground, you got it, guys.

01:42:39

Federal code. Yeah, that's insurance. Out of range. Great thing.

01:42:54

Crystal just unleash on this troll. That just popped up to the supplement folks. Is that around the corner? Could i borrow a bunch of girls the face? Yeah, they just wanted to ask for some flower.

01:43:14

Well, there's a flap of one arrow.

01:43:23

Okay, so is 17 the botch. Misses 12, misses the arrow hits.

01:43:35

And he drops to the ground and we'll take a five foot.

01:43:53

Bum bum. So all four of the elves are just staring at Grayson incredulously.

01:44:07

Just like what the actual fuck just happened. I like to imagine that he uses one of the like japanese style bows. It's like seven feet tall and he's like four feet tall. Just i don't know how he does it, but he does it. He will look over his shoulder at them and in common because he doesn't speak Elvis.

01:44:27

Should just say i it's trained by an elf, she's a around here somewhere.

01:44:39

Shall we looence Andrew were playing chess somewhere in one of the caravans uh, she losing, you are doing the caravan stuff, they're the ones keeping the caravan safe. Well, you guys do all these encounters.

01:45:03

Oh, shoko.

01:45:11

Uh, It's to use his new feature events tomorrow. What takes out in his drums and begins. Playing is masterpiece and whereas other uh whatever he played before it's always just been looking as simple like backing rhythm to like just sort of hype you guys up. But this is the drums are clearly.

01:45:43

Infused with crazy magic right now. They are way louder than they should be and making noises that they shouldn't be able to.

01:45:55

If you want to go to musical reference, i would recommend the, uh, the pokemon track magic card festival for this. I think that's, i think that's about what the kind of the kind of trip song, kind of back. I'm gonna i'm gonna provide that because that is a joy that everyone should have another profitable is one of the better track sticking out of Pokemon.

01:46:30

So yeah, you won't get haste.

01:46:36

Up to one allied per barbell. I only got seven barred levels so i guess that's

01:46:46

I get the zero on a grayson.

01:46:53

Uh, oh chi. One, two, three, four, five. Uh, no way would be six wherever she is and i guess the uh,

01:47:13

Of the nearest elk man will also get the buff. I would give it to our our wolf but just take me but i can't find him anywhere. Are equal to 15% of your level right now. Hit one.

01:47:40

Yes, but you didn't have to use a cell on it which makes it amazing. Yep.

01:48:01

Doesn't required the mp3 for that. I'm gonna set it up so that that plays later later, not right now. All right, but i i have the mp3 so we'll play that 14 now. Well, we're in combat. Happy new year from britain by the way. Hey, yo, yay, house 2023.

01:48:23

Yeah, is a suck as bad as we thought it would.

01:48:29

Honestly, i'm not feeling much better than i did approximately 60 seconds. All is so yeah, honestly not impressed. Yeah that's fair. It's not nothing's been the same since 2012? No, that was when we hopped into the wrong time. Yeah, i will end my turn there because i don't believe.

01:48:49

Yeah, it says it requires. One standard action. So like, even though my my art performances cost a bonus action, a move action. Now of that doesn't apply to masterpieces. I don't think. Yeah, masterpieces are definitely their own thing. What level do i plug in for the buff for haste?

01:49:10

But noticed, it tastes it is later on. You might want to make a second bath for haste, and then 150 and it bar blood. So this real fun thing is happening. Where you see the wounds on the trolls closing that don't sound fun. Except for the one that greeting is like slaughtered to death.

01:49:36

I was about it. Sounds like Grace. Needs to shoot one things. Uh, what makes you think the one that grace and just hung full arrows? Isn't also going to heal good point because his unarmed strikes deal acid. Damage the video lesson damage. Well, they give you last damage. Oh yeah, bet you that dude's gone again.

01:50:00

I'm just gonna grayson's. Legs are so powerful. He's always 10 steps ahead also. I looked, i looked over the numbers again. One of the elves doesn't get. I forgot to count myself, i have just enough. I i have just enough to get the party but none of our friends here that was a good legs joke.

01:50:20

I gotta get one every episode. I don't know how to dance for that rhythm. That's their problem. That's the one guy who doesn't know how to dance, and maybe i just have a thing against Paladins because i always seem to hit paladins.

01:50:40

But you're seeing Abby should play at Paladin. I beat those three paladin on thursdays, the joke, and i play a pilot it on the saturday or sunday. Like you paladin who cannot escape crits video.

01:51:01

Oh look, it's the one i try. I hit the magic list earlier. Well, it's about to have a bad day.

01:51:18

I'm going to use a arcade point to are the cash flavor on the spell. Oh no, never mind, it's not good. Wouldn't be worth it.

01:51:29

I wonder how many people i have to be around before. Inspire, courage, becomes better than rondo, because courage doesn't have a up. I have a cat. Uh realistically. It depends on accuracy bonuses. And currently your performance is only well, plus two.

01:51:53

Uh, i believe so. Yeah, yeah. So it doesn't. Hey crap. I'm just gonna move internal runtime. Oh well.

01:53:33

You're still dead. You're just healing.

01:53:44

Said something on fire. It looks like torch, okay?

01:54:00

Combat expertise is in a standard action. It's like power attack, right? Just turn it off and on slash defensive stance. Pretty much jim. Okay, cool. We're going to take a five foot step up to this scary one in front of me.

01:54:21

Turn on, please don't kill me buff.

01:54:32

And then do some stabs.

01:54:38

Medium.

01:55:08

That's how that goes.

01:55:14

Oh, those are actually a lot of kids. Only your second attack. Missed red is what he's feet. And that's OG's. Turn.

01:55:38

I invented his turn and then he has six hp.

01:55:50

Uh, okay. He's gonna bite clogged clogging. You please miss a

01:56:04

Landed. It only row one there and things goes all miss. Oh, geez too fast. Boom. Um, where is no way?

01:56:28

Taking minus 5. Never mind for secondary attack. Or even have hit their. Oh wait, yeah. Pregnant the building weapon. Okay, no, they're using a bite. Everybody is getting. I listen 1.7.

01:56:58

Well, they're by the bite. Has a minus five to attend to hit now. It's the fucking sbc converter.

01:57:19

Oh, now it's fine. It's fun for right now, okay?

01:57:40

Oh, okay. That's that's three ones and a three. That's not invite. You, we have two channels. Proper mini. That ain't hit wrestling her.

01:58:08

At the Olympics. No way.

01:58:23

Stab.

01:58:51

The troll goes down and ouchie. You get the joy of seeing tuna is and innocent. A moments before she disappears again.

01:59:10

Magic other 40 feet and dear.

01:59:24

Hey, i actually don't think any of the trolls can awaken in time to do anything to stop it. All right, either between zero or just, the snowcaster elves, there are scorching rays flung and all of their bodies. Technically, it's going to be like boring hands. The, the snow wardens are all also capable of casting them.

01:59:55

Ah you are not helpless. Then wonderful. We feared we would have to defend your caravan.

02:00:07

Oh and then they just fucking vanish apparently. Well, yeah, they they saw that. We don't need help and they just left and they just up and fucked off.

02:00:20

But i'm gonna get rid of that mod.

02:00:27

I install them up the the cleans up the battle mat at the end, but unfortunately, it also removes things like npcs, you'll note that koya, endemico are also gone Weird. You guys you guys hear two noise simultaneously? Don't tell me, she's being good enough again.

02:01:22

This is not a place often traveled by yours. What brings you this far to the north?

02:01:34

Okay good. This is an elven or in common, it's in common now, okay? Oh, we make do north for lean. Uh, or you have business there, that could not wait until the season's passed.

02:01:58

You know, you are heading on into a storm. Half of head will be difficult. You should go around the storms, fire, rages constantly.

02:02:13

Yeah.

02:02:17

Um, not to ask more of you, but could you tell us anything more of this storm fire? Please may we may have business there as well.

02:02:39

People do not go near the fires. They were built by a people long dead, even before ours were here.

02:02:52

The storm spire has a new mistress and it has been active for some time.

02:03:05

Do you know anything? Okay.

02:03:12

In details. No save that the storm seem to obey her commands,

02:03:26

Well.

02:03:31

We thank you for your warning and for your age. But okay, so it's like

02:03:47

Then i wish you good fortune and i hope that the storm is not your last

02:03:58

And then yeah, the snowcaster el just sort of vanish into the snow.

02:04:06

All right, and that's what we're going to give our 10 because i really have spotty. All right.

02:20:35

A team magnets, i am back. Now, i've just i've just returned i am here. Exit. Our follow drive. I heard very loud. Banger off and bought something outside. My house could have like caught fire. Um, put chocolate, i didn't cut off, it's great, but i was able to put a question.

02:21:04

So i have i have bagels. Oh, i wish i had bagels for this.

02:21:18

Hell. Yeah. And i'm just eating pizza.

02:21:27

I had, i had my, my fellow pizza for the month yesterday. It was like two slices and nope, i'm good. Thank you. You know, thank you.

02:21:43

Here.

02:22:00

Down plus 50 outages. Uh, that's the exact same encounter. It's happening again.

02:22:13

Thing. Again, we're just gonna reroll that.

02:22:25

101. What what? You don't have room for that many dalmatians.

02:22:44

All right. I burn all these goddamn dogs. Black monolith, not with a condoms.

02:22:59

Well, it's okay guys. Shoco made sure to pack up all the bones of the dragon that we already killed twice and bring it with us.

02:23:16

Don't have no, i would have kept a piece of the skull just add to her ongoing collection of like annoyingly. Powerful enemies that we've slaughtered

02:23:32

Hey, no, man.

02:24:24

You find another one of those black monoliths with the frozen dead, hasting around it.

02:24:34

I do not exist here.

02:24:42

Perfect.

02:24:47

Buff check.

02:24:56

Love check. What buff i said, buff check not bluff. Check because i am a really bad about taking my buffs off. So i made sure to go remove defensive stance and haste

02:25:13

I don't, i know the only two bops i have going on myself. Were made drummer and

02:25:24

Julio's buff. And grace and shit. Also have a major market going this way. He do bingo shoots, where that's some space.

02:25:42

Right, reminders with sort of members of parties to do and stuff.

02:26:07

I feel like marshalls, getting fret. Also, kind of needs to be on there. Oh yeah, i think you should be happy for health. We knew that it is. In fact, a new day. What a mistake. What? I want a mistake of a day. Why is there more monoliths?

02:26:33

There's always more monoliths. I like for them to be less neo. You see the undead before they see you.

02:26:49

So that is unfortunate for them.

02:26:54

These are the ones that go up like kindling, right?

02:27:00

Uh, they do have damage vulnerability to fire? Yes.

02:27:07

Well, i'm gonna hit at least four of them with it. Well i played more like i'm like to up the catalog of the cell in our team point and you're just gonna plant it, okay? Yeah. Yeah.

02:27:48

Wait, we could target the envelas. Maybe we should try breaking one thing to see if that does anything knowledge medicating. Don't do that. Just because i put a token for the image. Don't don't don't just try it. Do not destroy it. Boom.

02:28:10

To the area is a load. Bearing bulge.

02:28:15

Channel and return. No, i one of those took half but still exploded. Well, he took half and half again. I got you. Okay.

02:28:30

A drink a cup of endless tea from from ochie's pizza and disappear. I'm just going home.

02:28:42

Hit him with the casual. The casual slope. Yeah. You hear a loud? Slope coming from directly to the right of you just like so at what point does this become like flower viewing?

02:29:11

Well, i think it's mostly just zero.

02:29:18

I'm sorry, maybe i should. I'll let you guys kill them next time. Oh, she's gonna move there, drawing his weapons and then he's gonna end his turn.

02:29:34

Already bringing us to shoko. Then um,

02:29:56

30 feet and die up. Go. Go. Almost, no, he's not gonna fucking play his masterpiece for one white. You guys get inspired courage and you should be happy. Thank you. It's my encourage, and you'll like it.

02:30:22

The one remaining hard, frost spirit.

02:30:29

Proceeds to quit. Oh, shoot for max damage. I'm waiting for it. It does tend to be my luck on players.

02:30:43

That's not bad about you sans that you phrase that like it's a bad thing when i've been with dm's who would be giddy at that idea.

02:30:56

A 23 does not hit an OG. It do not.

02:31:08

Me, i am the demons and the in that phrase. It was me.

02:31:16

It was magnets all along.

02:31:28

Oh, she cannot charge. Sauce, what she likes charge?

02:31:43

This is not gonna fly on the throne, you know,

02:31:55

Jason.

02:31:59

Press new grace and things.

02:32:18

All right, so you guys can just murder all of the lobby things. Now, well done. Everyone zero can cast viable. It was different.

02:32:36

I mean yeah well the nicely bunch like that. Yes. Fireball is the thing. Oh this is not a negative comment just drift aback like. Yeah, it's probably five ball in a walking glob and dirt.

02:33:02

Uh, you break a wheel.

02:33:07

And that's the journey, a good thing. We all of them ending. All right, everybody gather around the very next day. Another week everybody gather around. We're gonna drink plum liqueur.

02:33:27

This. I forgot to add cookie. That one. Okay, so that's the 68. One of your horses. Breaks a like,

02:33:40

Beeping, right? I didn't know what horses could perform.

02:33:49

Sometime during these last couple of days of faulty wagon wheels. Some of the caravans provisions became tainted. Spreading a sickness amongst many of the guards.

02:34:04

Was at least we have choir supposed to be able to help with that. Yes, between using ample amounts of purified, food and drink and remove disease. It takes them about two days to root out and get rid of the eruption foods.

02:34:36

Wagon Wheel. Uh no, of course, like no 79 is the snowcaster elves again. Hello, we're gonna

02:34:53

You don't have any reason to talk to you again.

02:35:01

Really.

02:35:06

All right, so it's gonna move you on. You are not yeah. You're?

02:35:15

D100 are not being kind to you. How do i even with all of this? Um, so you encounter another black monolith? Uh, and more of the walking dead, but, uh, we're just gonna breathe past those. They're not a threat to you guys anymore. Uh zero blows up. The monolith.

02:35:43

What happens if we do that 84 plus 50 is 134. No. I mix a game of like getting a slight and every time zero passes fireball she writes it out of 10. Like that illness symbol a bit. Exactly like that. Conister a bit. I'm glad you're, is there more just during her best phasma like to thank the OG, does a little sketches every day, like landscapes.

02:36:17

And then for the last, like, five days, it's just been a blank white sheet and you just puts a check mark at the bottom, it's just plain open. Snowy tundra. So, on one of the nights.

02:36:45

About two hours into traveling. One night off, realizes that they have been following mirages and decides to wait until uh the light shifts back to normal before. Moving on, but you wasted about two hours of travel in the wrong direction because of the mirage is, oh, hell yeah. That one's fun.

02:37:11

Imagine being caught up and and we're not doing that with the trust your eyes.

02:37:31

Find it defeat. Another black monolith 130.

02:37:41

With 140 or 4.5 in the other one, you rolled finally time for the crevasse. Hey, dear. Are we going to die now? Nothing good ever comes out of a crevasse. You have never been to the proper bars.

02:38:36

I just heard an explosion outside. A new year. It's beginning and it's only 650. Yeah. So the crevasse is actually a caravan specific encounter a rift in the ice blocks, the caravans path, uh, doing so. But a wrap, our convert. Our wagons into rats. Yes. So but divisive means of bypassing the gravas doing so requires 1d6 hours of work, plus one hour per wagon, you have five wagons so 26 plus 5, i do a quick question.

02:39:17

How, how far across the crevasse? Uh, i i don't they don't give me that kind of information. It's just a caravan encounter, the casting airwalk dimension door, floating disc fly levitate or shrink item. Grants a plus one bonus on this deck per spell or effect. The caravan can make this check as many times it's necessary with the same expenditure of time for each.

02:39:45

Check. We don't have a security role for the caravan so we're not really going to make the check. We're just gonna assume you pass.

02:40:00

It's it's 100% like the um, what were they? Oh my god. The goats the goats from the love and thunder movie i can't even. Oh my god. Every time they come on screen. Every single time it is reaches into my soul finds. What i find most humorous in all of the universe and punches.

02:40:25

It. It's fantastic. Just like the people. I know gave it bad reviews. It was pretty fun. I i enjoyed it but yeah the love the rainbow goat chariot. You actually cross the converse in like record time because that is minimum time. Hell yeah.

02:40:51

And as you approach the tower. Oh wow. Already. What, what do you mean already? I rode like 15 times. It's been like two weeks. At least they were so easy. We literally fought like a bunch of undead to get here. We fought like undead like three times. So, the frozen in the frozen dead encounter is no longer challenging for you guys.

02:41:27

It's just xp grinding. We sleep. Zero gets a spells back. He fireballs all of them. Yeah, sleep zero gets his smells back. He fireballs all of them. We're bored grinding and the elwood forest or whatever that one forest kill 14 boards to protect the trade, right? Yeah. All right, as you come within, 50 miles of the storm tower, you can see a blueish glow out in the northern horizon that intensifies as the tower comes into view within 10 miles, you can see the massive black spire itself and the strange blue lights emanating from its apex.

02:42:03

The storm tower is a hexagonal sphere of black basalt towering hundreds of feet into the air. The tower is mired in the lake of black slush with a shattered stone causeway, leading across the lake toward a gaping hexagonal, opening in the wall at the base of the tower, a huge crackling ball of blue.

02:42:24

Light floats just above the tower's roof, while reaching white storm turns in an expanding spiral overhead. The tower is 300 feet tall.

02:42:40

Who i wins. Endlessly circle the storm tower. I ground level winds are severe within 100 feet of the tower, increasing to storm or wind storm strength at 100 feet or more about the ground.

02:43:01

Well, that looks inviting.

02:43:07

Much bigger than i was expecting. We're gonna do taller the sour, they won't going for. We shock in the shadow of the cradles Twitter. So, hey, and a thing. I think that is red, but it's supposed to be hexagonal shaped with a hexagonal, open door at the base. That's what they provided do.

02:43:41

We think we're going to die before we get to that door.

02:43:49

Lots of ways.

02:43:55

Yeah, i'm sure we'll be fine. Let's go. Knock on the door. Is there a way we could maybe somehow approach on the scene or is it? It's clear in every direction. 100%. I have sour on dude. I'm betting. So it's actually not clear in any direction. There's a big spiraling storm overhead like constantly storming.

02:44:23

Oh, so if it's poor enough visibility than maybe they can't see us from the top. Well, the people of the top are not who you're worried about, as you get closer to the tower. You realize that there are hundreds of skeletons roaming around the enormous fire and light.

02:44:47

You'll never you'll never get the whole caravan up to the tower on unseen.

02:44:57

Oh look, it's easy enough for me. But what about the rest of you? I i could play them the song. Maybe they'll let us through, if i'm good enough. It's basically. The ap saying this is for the party to go and do because they can't bring the caravan. The party can easily sneak through the heads up to the tower.

02:45:22

What are the space out enough? We can just all right. Okay, for sure. I was like, well, i'm making how you feel about just being how you feel about going back to the rusty dragon.

02:45:41

Yeah, so uh we go have anything any way of hiding ourselves from their detection as we approach. Well, let's keep the caravan safe so you can go put like some back them up, put some canvases over everything, we'll let the snow and the nastiness make a little camouflage for them.

02:46:01

We want them to be safe and not fight all these. Hundreds of undead and then we can snee.

02:46:10

Yeah. Yeah, dear wants me to go and scout the roof while you do that. Yeah, we could, uh, send we should not send anybody alone. I don't think i know you're sneaky sneak but like, bracing probably has an incredible stealth score if i remember, right? Uh show goes dexy, pretty much any of us.

02:46:36

Could go just like, watch you back. I don't there's a lot of undead, there's a lot of them didn't, some of these have heat scents too. Not these ones. But we've encountered undead with like heat vision the the weight. Yeah, there's probably some pretty spicy stuff going on here.

02:46:56

I don't think you should go by yourself necessarily.

02:47:02

That's emoji's. Bird opinion. I think paranoid was grace and as a scouting party would be a good idea. They're both fast on their feet. They could get themselves out of trouble with anything happens. You're not supposed to be there yet.

02:47:22

Yeah. Oh, she's gonna help hide the caravan and whoever is scouting go scout. While we stealth it up for the people were leaving behind effort for what it's well. I wasn't suggesting like we we get like the battle map if you get what i mean. Yeah. Yeah, there's more just a like, you know.

02:47:43

Yeah, we do have to actually somehow maneuver with you. That's annoys. Just volunteering to like, didn't wrap what the quickest way would be? No, for sure. Do you think?

02:47:55

Let me be a ninja for five seconds. This was a this was going back to the rhyme runner's. Guild, would you like? Oh, i'm just gonna look and then we got out the map and then you cleared the whole building. Well, that is exactly why i voiced this right now because like i don't i don't want to take away anyone else's experience and i still feel pretty bad about that.

02:48:21

No you're good. That was that was happy to not do all this rooms. I was just, it was great. Yeah. As, as og i'm like, i don't want to send you alone against hundreds of undead. I know you're invisible but we're running. It's pretty magical shit lately. Yeah, and the good news is that every time we run into more magical shit, i also get more magical shape.

02:48:46

Tell me how experience works. All right. Go scout. Do it. Invisible won't come ahead. No hair goes. Invisible of an OG watches. His little drinking jug like float away. Yeah, probably honestly. All right, once you get um maybe you make it through, you get up close and you see the remains of a great causeway of white stone leads up to the base of the tower.

02:49:27

It has long since to come to time in elements leaving only a few ruined. Spans standing exposed above. The black slush surrounding the spire, a wide gap separates, the end of the cosplay, from a hexagonal portal, into the tower's wall.

02:49:50

Is for no way of scouting. It is the only way in or out of the tower. Gotcha. And the outsides of the tower up here far too slick to get any purchase for climbing on, uncannily smooth and coated in ice to boots.

02:50:14

Um, the entryway doesn't go. Any obvious like craps are alerts or anything like that. I guess the question after that would be, how recently has anyone else contact this area? I know that was a lot of them dead around, but specifically like around in and out like that traffic.

02:50:45

Well.

02:50:55

If if i can't determine that the little worried about give meals for fieful check. That's about right? Yeah, that's yeah.

02:51:13

There's actually been a lot of movements and there's there was so much movement that you can't actually discern individual things. But the tower is clearly occupied by a number of individuals of varying kinds because you can pick up on that easily with a 10 and the botch is not an auto fail.

02:51:45

In her dusting. Um yeah, you investigate the black splash, what a wonderful question.

02:52:00

I would love to investigate how utterly toxic this is to the environment. It's it's pretty toxic going. How? How toxically talking?

02:52:17

I mean, this doesn't come back, let's see. I'm bursting in poisons and alchemy, so i would hope that if it's like a naturally occurring thing, i would know about it, but your mileage may vary.

02:52:43

So is poisoning that gives you a minus one penalty to ac and attack rolls for each field check.

02:52:59

So neuro toxin in the snow. Yes. That seems massively inefficient but i'm gonna go off if you're going for style. I suppose so don't wait for the strange, black slash five. Uh, israel, like the entrance where the power light doesn't involve going through the black slope, right? Um, let me just not that, it's not as funny.

02:53:44

Well, we'll go ahead and move here so that everyone can see

02:54:09

Yes, this is the causeway, there's a gap that needs to be jumped here. All of this under here is black slush.

02:54:23

Old man, they were so pretty.

02:54:29

And then you build them up. Yeah. But they're so small when i pulled them from the pdf. Failed maps also have done or something. That's fair. Yes, um okay. So there's like a five foot productive jump over, if there wasn't somebody in this group that cannot jump five foot crack.

02:54:57

Um, oh, slippery ice on stove. Yeah, i know. I know. It's okay to say you look at the two like geriatrics in your group. She'll go. Looks like he's gonna pop a hip. Uh, i don't think ochi is going to like allow One message.

02:55:29

Let's flashback to that one time. That shoko fell and brine wall. Keep and coyote featherfold and started the boss fight. Sneeze. We all think that a maker is the main character of the spotlight. She's not it's actually class. That's what this world. We're just living in. This entire adventure was just about her last horizon.

02:56:04

As an old woman we could becoming emperors of the subplot. We can we can all make it though, right? Shoko can jump five feet. I'm pretty sure anybody can jump five feet. Um, yeah. Yeah, i've got this when when you say i've got this could you give us a numerical chance value on.

02:56:26

You've got this.

02:56:32

Shook up. Just now as his eyes you see? Like no way halfway through taking up one of her boots like just to be able to jump shoko, are you appearing as human or as a kitsune right now? Um, human okay. If you were a consumer, i was gonna be like, if he fails the, the acrobatics to jump.

02:57:01

I want his like backwards, bent fox legs to like break but break forwards. Like a like he tries to jump, but as i've jumping his legs just fault, it's big dog. I feel bad, i don't know why. But now that you've like you've mentioned obviously that. I i basically just been reminded oh yeah you are actually some weather specifically with like all of the frost and the thing i can only imagine that you throw would just look like a fucking pom-pom.

02:57:33

Just a little bit of ice on the end of it. Just big poof, popular really good at dealing with snow. Yeah. They are okay, ochi long jumps from behind shoco to the other side. Well, we were here for noise scouting first so i'm assuming okay for sure. Yeah. Yeah, she'll have mentions like okay two phones one, which i think it's been a lot of foot movement there.

02:58:02

Come to screen exactly how many is such. But it's there's there's definitely people in residence. And oh yeah, black slushy stuff never toxins. No, don't touch it. Don't like it. Don't look at it. Highly advise being able to navigate your way across the icy cracks. For those of you who wants to attempt to do so, Website eyes.

02:58:33

As far as the jump, we should be fine.

02:58:45

Don't go looks at you guys. What once everyone? Looking at me side eyes harder.

02:58:58

Look. I mean, i'm getting a little worried about your hips hun.

02:59:05

Oh my god. Look, i just, we need to rock the whole, i'm sure. Okay. And his blanket which is part 3. Sorry, sorry this appears

02:59:26

You know, it has the same strength score of the juice.

02:59:36

Well, if you are star knife shaped, i'm sure she'd be able to lobby what cross that gap with no problem.

02:59:46

Um, it would be an acrobatics check, right? It would be an acrobatics like, yes. Okay. Yeah, try to go. I've gotten my shirt together since then, and nods mentioned coins. Thing that she does, that makes us striar whatever. It is really helps. Oh yeah, my concern says the the material voice next to you, isn't that you don't make that jump.

03:00:14

It's that you make the jump and then ski yourself directly into an interesting winter bath.

03:00:25

Triple just pinches the bridges nose. Wonder if you understand.

03:00:37

Hey um oh she's like some some cleats would help. Wouldn't i, they would help you stick the landing. That's true. Yeah, i have a question. Can i take somebody with me with dimensional slide or no? No. Okay, outside. It's a very, very, very good trick. Oh yeah. Okay, reduces the penalty for walking over.

03:01:17

Slick surfaces. Okay.

03:01:28

Well, let's give it a shot. Winter is coming.

03:01:36

All right, been there a while motherfuck.

03:01:43

What are we going? You know, nothing now told Oh, that's right. I forgot to i forgot to ask our friends if we should be aware of anything. What friends? Oh creeps. No, i don't actually press the button. Should go inhales like he's about to huh? Oh, the birds.

03:02:18

I forgot about the birds, the birds.

03:02:32

Right. Shoco in the throws of his midlife crisis. We'll jump across as fast as he can without even consulting here because he's not old damn it. Not old well. All right. I mean, now i will just walk across and meet you at the gates. After tracking with the gate doesn't have something like a claxton that will sound the moment someone steps in front of it or something has happened.

03:03:12

All right, before we before we go any further, uh,

03:03:22

Just in case there are some traps in the way here.

03:03:30

Circle will ask you guys to back up so that you don't enter here with this. Oh no, it's a cone shaped underneath. So i don't have to as long as i'm not looking at you guys, i can make sure that there's nothing going out to going on before you get.

03:03:43

I think you can do that. Yeah the game is paused. I don't know how you moved. I moved in ah and now i'm gonna go. Please join me on the combat tracker. We're gonna be moving in initiatives.

03:04:00

Perfect. Fantastic. Makes sense. I'm just gonna mute the channel for the tab for foundry and then start playing this poking. Tournament music that i've never heard. It's pretty good. Isn't it pumpkins will underrated gem?

03:04:27

Zero. I like how i go. I go first like, oh, okay.

03:04:49

The silence indicates. You're probably going to but i haven't seen. I am going.

03:05:01

My chest action path. I'm going to pretty much hit. Uh, myself are nice little, our ninja ochi. Miko and quick.

03:05:30

Pretty much that's five people.

03:05:38

There's some tissue with his eyes closed, right?

03:05:47

That's in my comfortable, so you didn't serious. Um, for sure people. Oh fuck. Okay.

03:06:04

Crucible, concentrate, for moment and standard actually have passport skin yourself. And then as a swift action we'll spend a key point to activate his high jump, monk ability. I have new 15 people forward and then do a standing forward and he's aiming for like way over here.

03:06:37

That's going to female, man. I'll take 10.

03:06:51

I yeah, yeah.

03:07:09

Station just done some fucking 720 kick left over shuttles and really dead. My rules and rise just through glasses. Does some shadow signs multiplies into uh into another twin. And, and then i'm managers.

03:07:40

Um,

03:07:43

Oh wait. No no. I did. I don't know how to do that. I'm just like that.

03:07:53

So you ignore that traffic line.

03:08:01

So it'll last for 15 minutes by the way. Awesome. Um, mama important for every trigger anything that in here. Um, night yet. Well yeah, not yet. Is anyone else seen two grace and tokens now? No, let's see. When they're and one up here.

03:08:35

No, that's your where you move from last when i moved. You that one that one will fade out.

03:09:13

Gorgeous sort of like skips past. You show co like la la, you know what doesn't affect me difficult, terrain, high, five.

03:09:41

Is using acrobatics to jump. Oh, she did some tracks from your movement distance. In any way, it's part of Europe movement distance. But it doesn't it doesn't up or down my movement speed when i do it right. Yeah cool. Yeah, it does use a part of your movement speed.

03:10:04

Yeah if you for example somehow make a check that allows you to jump. Let's say 70 feet. Well, let me let me phrase the question differently. If i have 50 feet of movement and i can hit the DCs, i can just move 50 feet, right? Using the acrobatics to jump when necessary, you have to use 10 feet of movement, to do a to, like do a long jump.

03:10:29

Otherwise you take pretty nasty penalties. Not if you're a ninja it doubles through the months get things, it's it doubles the dc. If you don't have 10 feet to get a running start, if you're not a ninja or a month, as long as you have a key point, dc skill checks, made the jump are treated as if she had a running start.

03:10:53

Yeah, you you do get heat up. This is correct. Yes. So i don't you don't even need it, you can just walk on stuff. Uh yeah walks so but so like a fairy, here's a dumb question because no way and Grayson are in the way. I know you can move through friendly squares but like unless i'm jumping over grace's head which is like four feet high, which is actually kind of hard for acrobatics.

03:11:20

Can i just move past him? Can we just OG like side flips over him when he does this? Just do a, um, i got a baseball slide when you like, oh yeah, i'll go through his legs. How about that? We'll do that. So i can take 10 for this jump, and make it to there.

03:11:39

Literally just jump from where i'm standing to there and then continue movement and jump past grace, and get here. Unless i want to end up in somebody's square, but i have the acrobatics to do these. Just by taking time, which i can't do if i'm doing it as part of a movement, we're in an initiative.

03:11:56

How did Grayson do that?

03:12:02

I that's it. That was just something he had, he could make that jump with using the key point just from where he was standing. I guess so. Taking 10. Yeah, the the class ability also lets me get a standing jump as if i have gotten a running start. It's the same feature.

03:12:22

You have. So if you can make the dc from what you're study and you can jump that far, then you can just jump that party. You don't need to move 10 feet. I super cannot because he took 10 to make that job, but i would have had to make two jumps.

03:12:36

Otherwise, i'm rolling. You give what i'm saying? I would have had to take 10. You, you can just do it and like, somehow if you can hit the number, no matter how you do it by taking tennis a relevant, if you can just take that, if you can take that and then all the best to you but if you need to hit dc then you need to hit the dc you somehow hit the DC.

03:13:00

Taking 10 has nothing to do with it. Yeah, two jumps. Gets you there? Yeah, i can make them shorter if i don't like, instead of it was the taking 10 because we're an initiative, you know what i mean? I yeah, you have a plus 20 to your acrobatics. Like i don't mind if you take a 10, okay, that's what i'll say.

03:13:17

Like, i can do it. We can roll it and i'll probably make it. But oh g. O g. Does it like a crow getting bread from like a stoplight? Two little jumps.

03:13:36

He pecks the ground in front of Grayson and then pulls out his jug and drinks. Some sweet hot tea.

03:13:49

And then the ice rocks. Could you? This would be such a great show. Oh boy. Thanks awesome. Yeah. No. But the the frost whites do you stand up out of their melons of snow here? I was about to be like imagine being Shogo in this party. We're all four of those people.

03:14:09

Just like leap, 50. Linear feet forward and young. Amigo, just makes these little hops and he has to like no talk.

03:14:25

Oh, i'm sorry, it's not actually your turn. The charges are taking their hell of actions. Now then oh, oh, there's there's one next to him. Okay.

03:14:45

At 24 to hit it's flabber. 2018. Yeah. Yeah. Is it leaps up out of the black slash? You know, my earlier comment. I was like we don't see anything very just.

03:15:13

OG casts cry. Deeply. As an immediate action, it is exactly. The actual hell in my life.

03:15:27

They are not shaped like a friend. You're not friends. It is true. They're not friend-shaped. Okay, is this character aren't gonna terrify me?

03:15:42

They're about to like they're going to pull me into the fudge, they just yeah, they came out of this horrifying black sludge. So, i'm assuming they're gonna just be like, horrible to look upon.

03:15:57

Well. I don't suppose being in range. Koya gets me out of this at all. I unfortunately, her freedom of movement does not what's your cmd show. 19, all he needed was five feet. Those are actually kind of cool looking. I mean they're definitely scary but they're not horrifying they're just all right.

03:16:26

Kind of badass, local.

03:16:32

It's a knowledge, local for them.

03:16:38

We're looking for our 17 and above. Number two, though. OGN Shoko. They are aquatic monstrous humanoids.

03:16:56

Their buddies. See this with seeds with freezing black file. It's supernaturally, cold black biles, is a source of a, the additional cold damage when a chart a bites, a creature. As a standard action of the charter can expel its full store of bio is a breast weapon that could take the form of a 60 foot line, or a 30 foot, cone all creatures in this area.

03:17:18

Take 86 points of cold damage. Pardon a charger can use this breath weapon. Once everyone d4 rounds, while it's black file is recharging. It does not deal additional cold damage with its spike. Um, i don't think we did enough monolith fights to be leveled for what's about to happen right now.

03:17:39

But what it is the level for the storm type storms fire. No, we we did. It's just that i can't see through slush and you also triggered, multiple fights by jumping immediately into the next area, grace into the first, oh,

03:18:02

That the whole thing that put through my face, there's a description for the room. You just jumped into uh the remains of great causeway of white. Stone leads up to the base of the tower though. It has long since succumbed to time and elements leaving only a few ruined fans standing exposed about the black slush surrounding the spire one.

03:18:31

The entry hall which is where ochi Grayson and no, a r windblown. Snow has drifted into the corners and along the walls of this trapezoidal chamber. Piling up in deep, drips, identical hexagonal openings, exit the room, to the south north east and northwest. A strong wind blows out of the northern hexagon.

03:19:01

So that strong wind is in here and the frost whites are standing up out of those piles of snow.

03:19:14

Here they are all moving now so i will just reveal them to you guys. And now we shall go. Okay. So where am i? Am i on the surface or did he pull me under? Oh yes, i need you to roll for it as before me as you fall into the black slush.

03:19:41

Oh, he got pulled into it. He got bull rust into it by this dude 16. Good enough. Us as stomp fire and kicks him. Unfortunately, it is not luckily it only happens once an hour.

03:20:12

Black splash.

03:20:21

Minus one. Hope that they know to wait until specifically. Before my initiative, the one person who has the the fucking reaction abilities to stop this from happening, because the charger actually quite smart and mostly they attack now, because the rest of your party flew into the tower, You know, next time i say i'm not gonna do this guy.

03:20:54

I'm just gonna do this guy and thing. Fuck it.

03:20:59

And a quick bombs. I know. I'm sorry, they were literally hiding down the slash

03:21:10

Very easy.

03:21:18

But i get paul rushed off of the the the bridge. He's not grappling me right now. It is correct. You were bull rushed and the one that was coming up. The side kind of just let go of the side and fell with you into the slash.

03:22:05

I don't have a black acid.

03:22:16

All right. Everyone should be able to see the black flesh. Uh, debug on the items tab.

03:22:32

And you are technically in a liquid right now, but also not a liquid, kind of like icy quicksand.

03:22:57

Oh, okay. So standard action, like i said the rhondo starts. So i am now hasted and i also have koya's travel movement buff. So how far can i move here?

03:23:19

Well, you're about hand feet down. So add the haze, okay? Of the books to the land speed. So you got 70 so it would take you 20 movements to climb up and out. I would need a climb check for that though. What about swimming do you want to swim around in the black?

03:23:54

Slusher, climb out of it. Uh, well, if i try to climb his aop will just knock me off of the wall. If i swim then you'll have to try to grapple me. Just keep me. Here. Are you sure you want to take the chance against an aquatic monstrous humanoid?

03:24:17

What, what will neither option is good, but one of them and i would think that trying to, uh, but the DM just said, are you sure? So i guess i'll try to climb cyclone. It's

03:24:44

I do not have a plus 8 for having a quantity, that's what a hold of them.

03:24:55

I can't find the depot items tab to the right of the characters tab.

03:25:08

I thought well deep off the the travel domain movement says i get a climb speed do i not? Do i not have a plus because what that ivy plus nine to my client but i don't think i have uh no it's it is so that to give to all of your speeds.

03:25:24

Hold on there. Okay. Because the other thing is, i only have a plus one to my climb.

03:25:42

It is a hard thing. So i feel like trying to swim away, but huh, what's my swimsuit right now? I a quarter, your land speed.

03:25:56

17ish.

03:26:05

It's not going to get me out. Not from an aquatic creature. Now, there was some scooter, 60

03:26:26

Uh, what's the penalty to my AC? While climbing, i forgot. Uh, fucking unless you have a claim speed, which i do not, so

03:26:47

None of these are good idea. None of these are good, i mean, I think i have to stay right? Where i am opera use, the standard action cast to do something already. So i think yes, it's well.

03:27:12

Yeah, that sucks. It's really sucks. If it makes you feel better, they don't have improved grab or anything. So even if he takes an AL, when you start trying to climb away, he's not gonna get to auto like bull rush or grapple you.

03:27:39

Uh, can i perry and repost while climbing? Absolutely not.

03:27:49

I'm sorry. I, i shouldn't have said that with suchly. Uh, it's demarion. Repose. You have to have a weapon in your hand and then, that means you're climbing this year. I see surface will only a single hand. Um, yeah, i'm not calling a sheer eye specific, plus one. Regardless you might it'll be a DC 20, you might.

03:28:13

No, i'm gonna swim away. At least he won't get in full attack next turn, but he still gets some back opportunity when you swim away. Oh yeah. But he has four arms. So, i assume his full attack is four attacks. Oh, you'd be right on that. That is? That is fair.

03:28:38

Check that entire exchange went from like oh that's pretty bad. So thanks, i hate it.

03:28:47

So, yeah. Um, five and and then yeah you get the air off. Uh and my flat, put it in water to you are in fact unbalanced in water.

03:29:04

Painting with you. He should not have power attack.

03:29:16

And that's about the limit of how far you can get.

03:29:29

My cleats make me better at walking on ice because you will actually get out of the black star right over here. You see where it turns tan? Oh yeah.

03:29:46

But that will be, is for your turn. So the rest of you have facebook. So hey, crosswhite and don't you punch aquaria?

03:30:05

And i hate to, i don't does that hit with haste? Uh, it it's not actually, it does that brings her up 2018 for my 17.

03:30:21

Boom, but that means she gets that level negative back.

03:31:18

Don't forget your hey there, very soon.

03:31:31

In the ages from the saw from the the rapid drumming. If you have to be within 30 feet for that one six zone, half of miss leo.

03:31:59

Ugly.

03:32:04

I figured how i want to do this.

03:32:14

Apartment that one there.

03:32:29

Let's do it. I've been arcane point. And is that you is what means slamming stuff, if it slammed anything, okay? Because i'm just like, what the fuck is she? No that just that i can hear because i'm right here by the window. They're there's fireworks going off already. Yeah.

03:33:02

Little building.

03:33:12

Half damage. And,

03:33:29

Um, it's exoskeleton like clatters of it.

03:33:37

You should really turned you shivered. His timbers you, you didn't need grayson.

03:33:50

Uh can we how like is this one down here visible under the muck? Or is it completely? Yeah. I i should make him invitable.

03:34:05

I guess christmas was just attack the one next to and assuming that a maker will work on the the one that's next to her. Yeah. That's pretty fair to assume.

03:34:34

Why is your he see? So high. Oh, that's why, that's right. I greyson all of your arrows bounce off of the shields and armor of this bite. Okay, which is really a better quality and armaments than the previous whites. You have faced.

03:35:07

What's at first try?

03:35:22

Isn't doing.

03:35:36

You guys hear the faint sound of wrestling on stone coming from this chamber over here.

03:35:46

And you see a burst of snowflakes as if something moved through the snow. No. Hey.

03:36:08

Here's all of my choices have but i'm going to have to go with what i think is the safest one because i know what that tell was. Uh, so hand ghost color, smashes, a link side shown. Is there anything invisible here? Just turn on your theme visibility. Oh, fuck me.

03:36:32

Did it actually changed my census? I don't think it did. Oh, there we go. Okay. Is there now? Oh yeah.

03:36:52

Yeah, that's problematic.

03:36:57

Um, and

03:37:04

She is in tían going to very loudly mentioned ghosts or some invisible ghost like shit i guess.

03:37:19

Then why is it goes? I'm thinking of like he's invisible. I've been watching waited person, a phantoms poltergeist. I mean, i could ask for a description of what i say, but uh, knowledge nature, i will. I will show you a picture of what you see. I would love a picture of what i, what i see.

03:37:50

Oh, oh, okay. Um, scratch that invisible plants monsters. What the fuck? It's a fucking marlboro. I i wasn't gonna say it but i hate these never have. I felt so justified and saying, zero, you need to blast this cardinal. Um, are you sure you want me to bless the whole quarter because i will do it, all right.

03:38:26

It's still noise turn, though. You haven't actually done anything yet. I'm actually that was my son's an action. Yeah. And you know you are you telling him to bust a corridor? No. I just thought i'd say that because it was funny. Um, no cheap wood loudly after saying invisible plants, you can't hit zero blast.

03:38:58

This would you. All right, i'll try. Um, and then is going to use my, um, that's right, action, two ten invisible and then move there.

03:39:26

I'm just use my my managing trick just to do something. That was my move. That was my standard. That was my swift. I hate everything about this.

03:39:58

Boo, boo. And 15.

03:40:15

No way. Yeah, did you see it?

03:40:24

Hi, i'm i'm seeing it.

03:40:29

So there is there is suddenly a big old patch of blood.

03:40:37

And now, all of you get to see weird sort of after image of it. I'll show you again. It looks like it's blurring in and out of reality. When steal people, make another check to figure what noise nature? Yes. Oh god, because they do become briefly visible, when they attack.

03:41:06

This is an evil place. Well, we did trigger two encounter to walk. So, all right, so zeal, this is a frost phantom. I they are well known for their ability to be under the effects of greater invisibility constantly, though, for a brief moment after it attacks. It becomes a transparent version of its normal self.

03:41:36

This can allow any of you bureau worth line of sight to to the frost banking to pinpoint its location, at the time of the attack. Although, if the creature moves after attacks opponents have to pinpoint it again and opponent can ready in action, the strike of fungus when it momentarily appears in, which case the creature only has concealment.

03:41:53

Instead of invisibility 20% is chance. The fungus concerned completely visible as we move action and though, it normally remains invisible at all times, it killed while, invisible becomes visible onesie, core minutes later.

03:42:09

And then,

03:42:18

I love forge. This encounter is reminding me why i like from and zeo. You can forget everything i just said because you get something, i could not see a thing. I just realized that. Yeah. Shoko, also cannot see anything. Speaking of Shoko. It's time for him to die. Baba baba.

03:42:45

Um,

03:42:52

It's past my dr. Too. It's charter comes up out of the slush following you and bites on your ankles. You try to climb free.

03:43:06

All right. This one bite. Quadrival claws. Oh, they get. All right with tax jeez. Therefore arms and a big mouth.

03:43:21

There's the valid grid. Luckily, they're caused you very little damage.

03:43:33

Then it's immediately amigo's turn.

03:43:52

On. What are you doing storage? This is a really weird place to freeze foreign.

03:44:03

It's weirdly chugging, like what is going on? Look. Nope, and dance must be the broken one.

03:44:24

Looked action.

03:44:56

Putting that ochi. Wow. 27 to hit. Yes, it is 11.2 damage and a negative level. Oh, okay.

03:45:21

How do i do that? Uh, it's above since you can drag onto your sheet.

03:45:28

I don't like that.

03:45:38

Where you don't like no, i'm good.

03:45:47

Negative level attributes, roll all the way down to just build the point by a calculator level drain zero change that to one. This is to damage.

03:46:15

Attributes. What point by? Yeah. Yeah, i went to point though. I didn't see it. No, no, just about the point by button. Oh, level drain. Does that work? The same as negative level. It it is. Okay, there's also a pub. You can apply that results.

03:46:41

It looks like it worked little work for everything. She's gonna quick channel damage again, 11. Actually all of these wipes are still standing and they look pretty sturdy too. That i was talking about this guy, okay.

03:47:31

Why would he be dead? Perfect. Oh wait, he's he's fatigued, he's 15.

03:47:46

Not minus 60.

03:47:54

We know that they have less than 60 something if they didn't, i would like to file complaint.

03:48:10

Direct off the place to james jacobs 10 years ago. Okay, sorry. I didn't see koya. Do that. That heel what she did? She damage. Gotcha. Okay, i got you. Okay. Uh, multiple aos to get around behind them to go here. Question mark, trying to dodge gang stabbed a couple times.

03:48:46

Is it per acrobatics to dodge every single one of them? Now it's one acrobatics check from the DC goes with like, two for every concurrent one. You're trying to get pasta. Okay, well, i'm just going to roll it. I want to know if i had to roll them. As i went six to whatever they're seeing is towards the end.

03:49:07

They're they're consecutive, they don't all get plus six, right? Yes, they all get plus six. What the fuck is this game? Dude, because the idea is that you're trying to eat my bird ass

03:49:24

Okay, ochi is there now.

03:49:29

Koya. Threatens right. Oh yeah, it does have a star knife out. Okay. Okay, we're gonna do a stap.

03:49:44

Plus two for flank. And we'll add that, just because because we can,

03:49:56

Oh, i'm sorry. God damn it. I was i would like to have turned on defensive stance before i did that. That was my plan this entire time. If it will not hit consequently, i am okay with that. I, it doesn't hit. I'm sorry. I was sitting here so long thinking about that move and turning it on.

03:50:20

I always forget to turn it on. Go, i, we won't call that a hit. He's here. He's defensive stance now. It wasn't a hit. Anyways. Good good, perfect. Then, i don't feel bad, uh, movement standard advanced frost lights. I'm well, do i have any cool swift actions? No, we'll save them.

03:50:44

Okay, that's my turn.

03:50:50

Those two. She'll go. They have really high ac. Yes, they do. Uh, shoko will attempt to cast defensively? Is there? What? We're is there a penalty to casting in water? If i'm above water, no you could. You can put your feet down where you are now. Oh, just be out.

03:51:12

Completely. Once you're on the brow, oh, i can put my feet, don't where i am, and i would have tried to out of use my reaction to perry. This guy. I mean, you still didn't see it coming. I came up out of the water behind you, your feet are down, which means your shoulders and header above, the slash, okay?

03:51:35

Uh, beat beat down does not mean waste free.

03:51:44

So if i have do i have normal movement? Now done, no difficult terrain movement and i can't disengage in difficult, terrain. Can i no. Okay, guys, i'll attempt to cast defensively mirror image. Give me that concentration. Jack.

03:52:10

Got it. All right.

03:52:18

Four images. It's gonna be a long fight. Step away, i will try to step away and i will vote for doing that. East. You will, he would get what's been five? No, he did not. So, you still have an image.

03:52:47

Remember it difficult terrain. So it took 10 feet to get here, and then you're clear in this space.

03:52:58

All right uh is the oh you just see shoko come out of this fucking slush, just drenched in this toxic looking black. Sludgy ice. Oh, oh, do not do not go in there. Um, Circle then, move up and get back up to here so that you guys still have.

03:53:30

Uh, let's see how far.

03:53:36

Um, most of the, what's the measure?

03:53:43

Okay, oak. She still has the ball, but i think, i think no. I think i think no way. So has it too. You know what? Uh, abby can draw a line to me and it's up. Sexy fever. Where are you currently contacting these exactly where at? Okay. And okay, let's check our standard action.

03:54:13

That is move. We'll end this term. Good lucky guys. It's like you guys but to submit him i'm gonna hurt almost killed people. Yeah. Well, if you listen to know and that's, that's honestly like my horses, okay? And now, as the next part of this encounted begins, what does a moonflower the wall of snow off?

03:54:53

The side explodes out as just a mass of tentacles come flying out to grab atheist. Whoa.

03:55:16

Uh, the first tentacle just barely hits but the second one misses i wish that you guys could have seen because i was fully like sitting back in my chair that reclines with my arms behind my head and i sat forward, so fucking fast. When i think popped up on screen.

03:55:35

I mean just wait until i tell you those two invisible enemies directly next to you. All right? And oh, jesus. Fuck, i don't think of 26 confirms on you Bill. Grayson. Does it great to do something? Okay, so not a critical bite.

03:55:58

Know we, well, i've never used this creature before. It's a very strange creature.

03:56:09

Um, it's a plant who the hell uses plastic?

03:56:18

This is when you told me it's our original. No, it is a plant. Okay. So work. So it makes some tactical perform the attack. Oh, jesus.

03:56:42

That was supposed to be on grace and okay, so 10 more damage.

03:56:53

All right, so it a bunch of tensibles fly out. Grab grayson.

03:57:03

It's swallows him and then spits him out wrapped in this cocoon. You have have a crap when they grab them. It. I could do before he pulled in, okay?

03:57:44

Liberating command on him.

03:57:52

All right, so how big of a bonus does he get? Or plus 16. Excellent. Are you a good range? Yes, no no i'm not. Never mind. Never mind wouldn't have taken effect when Grayson was still here. Yeah, as a reaction, i would imagine. But that's still pretty 45 feet.

03:58:23

I do have. I do have it is within rain.

03:58:30

Yeah, roll your acrobatics. Escape artist.

03:58:45

I will be right back. The fireworks are going off in the dog and the baby or not. Enjoying it. Are you kidding me? Crazy. Damn, that's with the 16 already at it. I know i i'm not affects one.

03:59:05

I just was not prepared. Okay, it's okay. You know, i thought he would have this have ranks and escapers, you know?

03:59:18

No. Why would i have escapers? I've got a pretty good cmd.

03:59:27

It's, i forgot to make a thing for this. So, status wise. Am i intake, though? You are wrapped in a tight, digestive cocoon. And expelled into an adjacent square where it takes damage every round. 2d6 budgeting 2d6 acid. It has an internal ac of 15 and 25 hp. It's cocoon target.

03:59:54

Cannot use escape artists to get out of the cocoon. Oh i'm sorry. That was a whole mood plan. Anyways, other creatures can aid target by attacking with coon with piercing or slashing weapons, but the creature within takes half to damage from any attacks against the cocoon. Well, the cocoon is destroyed.

04:00:12

It deflates in the caves. Each creatures followed by a moonflower it is in case its own cocoon. So with your friends, i get my toe back, you get your stove bag because it was an escape artist check and apparently doesn't apply. Okay. I thought he was grabbing him you know to to do it.

04:00:32

It's functions as swallow whole. But it's specifically calls out not being able to use a skateboarders to escape from it.

04:00:47

No, here's the thing. We're about 15 minutes over where we were running today. And i know grace and said this time of was a little not great for him, so we can pause here and pick this up next week. After everyone, maybe does a little research readys themselves for this fight because it's gonna be nothing people that we can play this fight because we've got at least i assume another hour of this fight.

04:01:14

Yeah. I i can't going further than this. Yeah, let's look at everyone's good with pausing. Yeah. Okay, i'm sorry. What's going on? I'm back. We're gonna pause right here, because this is quite a big fight, and there's still a lot more of it to go. Oh, yeah, i imagine.

04:01:35

So another hour. Yeah. And we're gonna pick this up next week. I great work, everyone. I did not expect you so many of you the bobo into the storm spire. Well, after i asked twice, like, there's nothing like i need to do perception checks for it. Uh, like a man.

04:01:59

There wasn't because they weren't even by there by the bridge. They come up after a couple of rounds to investigate from their cave deep in the sledge. Yeah. Um i you know, just for how shit is encounter is they have a cave in the slash, by the way. Uh, they're stuck in there.

04:02:21

There's loose in their cape. You go get it. One of you's already poisoned by the slush. You can't be more poisoned by the slush but you can take it. You're going to cage and get the stuff. Yes, i oh fights over. We're all half dead zero's just like, okay, show go back in.
