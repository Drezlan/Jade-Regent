00:00

To do my very best to not for attention to myself. All right. I hope you're gone.

00:08

She doesn't use her glasses anymore because you uh you gave it like what she does have on her right now. Oh, Oh, what a difference. It makes.

00:29

That's the thing about disguises. They don't really have to take a whole nine yards with it. You can just do a few small things and you look completely different. Oh, gee is gonna smooth all of his feathers in a different direction and be like, did that do anything? Oh i think we need to get the pants out for you again and closet.

00:52

I think you just succeeded in making yourself look like you just woke up. No like his hair, his quote unquote hair like goes one way naturally and he just you know combed it over the other direction it's not like a backwards and forwards. It's a left to right? Sort of a deal you like it.

01:18

Oh god. Hold on, i'm on the caravan scene. I was like, i don't do it. You were all supposed to be here. Yes, we were. I just saw the art you put in for the the nine rings, nine-fold spirit sword, and then the cool armor, that no one is going to wear, sadly.

01:38

Yeah, that was the ghost beer armor. And no one in this party actually, you give it together or you can fill it as both.

01:48

What is she wearing it? Wait, is wolf still with us? Uh, oak will be making those journey back. Yeah, i think i remembered you saying something about that. I know scagged me like dipped as soon as we got to yeah, across the high ice and was like you're good right after the dead man's hill.

02:07

Hump whatever fight. Yeah very much ones you were on the other side. You, you're going to be safe, making the truck back on the off season. All by your lonesome wolf said you killed me and nuke shotgun taking the path of began high. Back the off season will be clearing soon.

02:31

We also killed. Everybody was almost three months like the off season's almost over. Yeah. And that was one of the questions i was going to ask. I've been trying to work the timeline backwards, three days per hex. No ways hair would be much longer if she didn't get a haircut.

02:51

Exactly. It's like, yeah, yeah. No. We we've gone. We've gone hobo ninja. It's entirely possible. The OG's had a birthday in this time. I'll have to figure it out. Uh yes. Ski, you're coming. You're still in the final month of winter.

03:18

Otherwise my my little prank i'm playing on. Poor grayson won't work. Ah yes, of course prank i didn't even google what that was until after i had already responded and i was like, oh that's beautiful in the in the rp channel. Yeah. Oh, i'm sorry. What? You described? How he was saying it?

03:44

I was like, i've seen every like every anime anti-hero make them miss you, and then move just doing the game. It is the only way grace and nowhere in the background just kind of over here. Is that looks sander. Looks bottle away thing. It's like we're we're finishing this.

04:05

I go get no no wait no. I understands to yawn. So she would have heard what the act would go holiday name. Actually means and i would have to i honestly did not notice that you guys had wrote some photos.

04:24

And i beat it by five or more which means that an unlikely lie is believable. Yeah, that was beautiful.

04:42

Um, so has everybody just getting really drunk to like, play along with choco's lie. It's like terrible says, no, i'm nodding alone. What's with a look of like it's terrifying. How you can say that for the straight face probably without and then takes for a while. Out reaches.

05:18

That's under like you, you can still drink, it's fine, don't tell him. Not that hell aggressive. I went ahead and hit the rest button by the way, because i just realized i was still down stuff. Oh, i should i should check all that. Uh,

05:36

You did say, we would be being greeted one. We got out of what you got. You got to the city. Yes. Uh but we didn't really talk about how you guys wanted to approach the city and search. We had to wrap up pretty quick at the end of last session.

05:53

Yes, we did. Yeah. Um, so now that we're in tion proper

06:09

We'll have to be on the lookout again, because if the if the five shadows had the five shadows, the five storms had agents infiltrated. So deeply into um, a call's guard. It was the city in. Yes, i mean even more. So like penetrating just so deeply all over. Uh, the the crown of the world agents and absalom daldor half the coast of arsia.

06:44

Yeah, look at the majority of the leadership though, and they can't actually do anything now. So it's kind of shrugs now we're going to go. Suddenly feel incredibly justified in being so paranoid about shapeshifting. My entire life, we're gonna go into. You should be yes. The eastern region regional managers.

07:07

I i'm out of words, district. He took out the western branch. Okay? I will be where i was going, but not is that if we can expect that level of observance, in the west here, in john itself, i wouldn't be surprised to look over there and see eyes and the trees.

07:36

What we need to be extra careful as we advance. Because now that the north has failed to kill us, like i assume the that the only hope would they will be redoubling, their efforts to get. Come on, right.

07:58

Hurry up. Let's go. You hear from, uh, No way. Leave your friends are very clever.

08:19

Really looks over. What fresh hell is this? The the incredibly tired? Look, on a nice budget. Continues to least that was pulls back back that gauntlet. It's like if you want to introduce yourself, you may as fucking well

08:49

It's downloading world data for me right now.

09:01

And that's what i think. It is ambi owner characters. Hello, my name's 22.

09:15

And what appears to be a jade ink tattoo comes alive off of her arm and up, turns into a little bunny in front of everyone. Oh, fucking hell! What are you doing here?

09:41

Oh my god. There's another one. Yep, you two know each other.

09:54

Let's just say we run in similar circles.

10:01

You wait, you hear way in like sarcastically sip his tea and then take another pup off his pipe OG pulsa raven out of his pocket. I have a pet too out of his pocket, is it? Of course, i'm so tired of this. You can turn the info familiar. You know there's a feet lines about it.

10:30

No no continue with your your cool rabbit and your cool monkey. Go ahead. Everyone. This is my recent raises a bottle towards ochi and is like a bird with a bird.

10:49

Oh, this is gonna be fun. Remind me to find christen for his levity when he comes around. Anyways, i just wanted to say hi well if i'm gonna be around, you should know that i'm here at least uh tutu. It's nice to meet you. I'm ochi. So, what again was sent here.

11:13

Um, buy shoes herself. Wasn't he? Well, you're on on account of tutu. Well, weigh-in. Probably wasn't sitting here directly by isuzu. Let's not really how what's exasperated at the monkey. We're we're serpenters emissaries. I'm here to help knowing in any way that she needs me to. No, i looks like she's about to throw something at the rabbit.

11:53

Oh yes. What a privilege does that mean she's also a princess sir.

12:05

Ravage is sort of like twitches, the snows and then jumps back on Noah's arm. Turning back into a tattoo. I can fucking do that too. I did it before. You did? Yes. Yes. When we get it, you're much cooler. Thank you. Everybody can recommended now but what happened to our third level, buddy, the the helmet.

12:32

I believe that was zeo. No. Actually he's thinking it was Andrew who's the only chaotic good person around except for coya. But koya doesn't do melee intentionally. Oh, she's gonna put his raven until his raven. It's okay. They're cheating. This is divine intervention. If i could give you the fucking bunny i would have.

13:03

Well, i think you would too too are a fantastic match no way.

13:11

You're pretty sure. Sure can just went past her head.

13:17

I bet it did well. I am, i will apologize for my lack of decor in your presence noahime and so we'll put aside together. That's it punch. There's a punishment. It's kind, it's coming back. Just immediately. Just punk loses her shit. This is there's like a 100% that's like anime bunk and then everybody does a sweat drop socioco's being punched then immediately turns around, i didn't do it.

14:00

Elsa goes over and checks on Grayson. Make sure he's still breathing. Yeah. Roll him onto his side. The blanket on him. Oh, kill me now. Ah, what the man? You know what? You know what? Actually, what a man.

14:21

Oh, elder will make make sure he gets to bed. Oh, she's gonna try and teach his raven. How to fetch? He's big. So you wound up not taking the invisible blade after all. Um, no, i very much did oh oh i thought this was. I thought this was the, the companion ninja trick is what this was not exactly.

14:55

Right, there are many ways.

15:01

Though, admittedly. Now, it is not perpetual angrama anime, anchor mock about it.

15:22

Right here is next to the alcohol.

15:30

Purple gets back up. Ah, that was uh you should be respectful to your own. There's no way but nearly killed me. Uh, I mean, it might have if it was speaking of being nearly killed, what is our concern? Just that the five storms might come after us. If we go in on disguised or just stupidly undefended into order high.

16:01

Yeah, we just need to be on our guard. And don't open the box. That's true. We've done well, the trying not to open it so far. Well, there is one small problem. Nobody thinks about go on. How like at this point? Before we thing i was, yeah, they haven't they're gonna resupply and stuff in town before they head back.

16:30

Okay. Uh hey garment there um based on your professional estimates how many people make it through living storms in the off season.

16:49

Make it through them across the path. If i can hide. I'm assuming there isn't that many little followed in a week? None that i'm aware of.

17:06

Your rival from the path of agonhei would likely. Cause a stir. If i was a paranoid we just come out in the dead of winter over the top of economy. Yeah, yes you did. Yeah. Have an incredibly bad living storm. Yep. Yes, you did. No, is is looking more normal than ever for a very good reason.

17:35

Um, not good. I'd like to not be assumed to be a traveler of our expedites at this point.

17:49

Well, let me just scroll up to our map. It's not like we can hide the caravan. It's going to be pretty obvious. That we're travelers fresh in unless we wake up some ludicrous story that way laid us for months at the border. Wouldn't be the first i imagine.

18:14

Anyway, no. Take it, seriously. If i'm brutally honest, i don't think you'll find the worst of it until we hit midpai proper. If they're or anything. Well, done. Let's turn our event, our retention to hong goal itself. What should we know about this place? Anyone, um, oh, you've been here before a few times?

18:41

Can you give us a as a parting gift before you take off? Can you tell us what you know about the land? Well, like dad said, golf's gonna come with us to order you hanging high before he turns around? So we're not there yet, but uh, um it's uh, it's Mongolia if we're out of character.

19:00

Yeah. Yeah. Uh, in character. He kind of just points it. No way your native probably knows more about it than me.

19:12

And then the way knows nothing. No ways from and back them off ice mark, i'm from cals guard, but my father was hungle. Yes her ethnicity is of this region possibly, i don't know a lot. Um, i can read unlock but it's not my first language as you can probably appreciate.

19:41

Um, there was um,

19:48

Doesn't and and she she kind of looks an old fun thinking this is like i imagine you're quite popular in in order actually, don't spend much time in the city. Proper. It gets annoying. Doesn't now um, that's a good good point. Hello. You might want to get a hood.

20:11

Uh those are fair and golden hair have a tendency to be seen as good luck charms. And they also don't know what personal space is. Deliver kind of like narrows her eyes. Like what you mean? Elda will likely get in trouble by the way, if someone someone tries anything with her, he's gonna punch a dick.

20:38

And dude. Yeah. How do i oh god some they're good. Do we have to worry about city poachers coming for our monkey? Our golden haired monkey? Yeah, possibly. Um, there's a general principal of going to turn way into a purse. Foreigners are kind of seen as one of two things either.

21:12

They are loved explicitly for being an exotic entity or they are different. And therefore you don't like them at all, no prize winning for which one, my father thought was the most applicable. The major thing for us though is just try to keep your heads down. Don't don't get in the midst of their superstitions.

21:40

There's a lot. They're all very stupid. Um, the major one being looks at ochi one more time. Sorry. Yeah, she kind of thinks and like weapons of all kinds are allowed and and such it's hungrys are very much a, a traveling people. But if you're going into someone's house or their place of work or anything, don't don't bondage a sword, won't be doing that, my father knows a little bit of it, he's a groom.

22:19

And so he respects the, the, the breeders here. It was very fine or stock and like i've said, they respect bravery and honor very much. So here not in hongo.

22:43

They respect strength under ability to adhere to what they think is, right?

22:50

So don't have your sword out from someone's house. Both literally on metaphorical understood at least not unless you're, they're your friends. I think last generally the consensus i don't know. My brother got told her for it all the time.

23:13

But that's about as much as i know. I couldn't tell you about the state of affairs of what the country is actually. Like only that was, i don't know what the rest of the mouth or like. But, well, i did travel through here once before, when i was younger on my way too far as you stroco nods.

23:46

Uh,

23:50

Um, and here's roughly what we can expect on the road there. Big bland marshwise. And then shooko would tell them that, uh, magnus does not know that. So, i would like a refresher. There's actually not a lot on the way to agony from or you hagen hive. Let me get you back to boom.

24:14

Boom, exactly. There isn't exactly, uh, a border check as we come down. Oh, there is a border jack at the north gate of the city. This is the end of the pathogenheim this is ordo wagons. Oh, okay, i got across the plane, i guess. And then it's specifically the cities, there's not a lot of cities that i do know, a little of this you have or do wagon high up here and then to the south, i don't actually know out of character if it's this south for this south, um, but there's one other city and it's, i forget what it's called, but you have already wagon high in the north and then the other city in the south and then between, it's just all no nomatic tribes.

25:15

They don't even appear on the map in the book there. You get them because bears that important to this campaign.

25:28

That is even closer than i thought. It was apologies.

25:40

So it is like right there. They said you have the peak of the world, isn't it? Yep. So you're like, camped in the mountains. Getting ready to descend the next day.

25:57

Muliwan is the city to the south and i would have to assume it's not towards the forest. I have no idea though. Room. People are scared of the forest for a reason. Good reason. All right, i guess my final question would be. Uh, what about the general relationship between the two nations?

26:24

Like what they see say, oh, she carrying katana and be like, oh, you're a samurai? And would that be? Would they be like, that's a would they react positively to that or well? It says, specifically in the gazateer that the nomadic tribes have like a strict code of like honor, so i think they might be super into like samurai for that reason.

26:47

But just in general as a culture, they have like kind of like an indifference towards outsiders. I would think because they know that this trade route is what keeps them in business. They're the only ones who control where the path of agony high and the spirit road converge, the only way out of the continent for trade besides ships out of goka like for other people, it's all intercontinental trade like.

27:14

But between this same continent. Uh, the only way that goods and services get in and out is through the pathogen high here or ships to like the middle continents out of goka in the wall of heaven on the western coast of the continent. So, it's specifically says that they like

27:37

They're they're just like we try to not bother people who are coming into trade but like if you get off of the road the rule is like your property. So if you're fucking around, you will find out sure. It say you're different. And therefore interior or the, oh, you're exotic.

28:02

A golden monkey and a rabbit called tutu and a fox and a bird. Oh no, their tattoos. Now, but you know what i'm saying? Yes, robin knows what's good?

28:18

I understand that threatening is just how you show your affection, so thank you for your love.

28:29

I imagine that like steam comes out of noise ears where she hears shit. Like you can almost physically see the smoke just like he's out of her. Just,

28:47

It is bad enough that i'm not allowed to shamelessly stab. The things i don't like oh, yes. Well, as we go into town tomorrow, it might be a good idea to dress down somewhat and maybe not look like we're full of riches and very conspicuously. The only people coming out of the living storm in the winter.

29:08

I mean, you're going to conspicuously be the only people no matter what you think. Yeah. And like we have to remember we're not traveling as just a party of six. We are a caravan. We we are not easy to hide.

29:28

So i guess that means, since we're the only ones to come through in winter, like all of our stuff is going to be in high demand and it's going to sell it uh, like 0.5 times higher than absolutely. Yeah, definitely supply and demand people. I like your attention. You know, i should have asked this at the start of this.

29:50

Um, so the caravan itself is Sanders right, huh? Where is it going with you guys? Okay, okay, i forgot. I i couldn't remember if like the caravan was like drawn up as something to to just come along with us or if like we were hitching a ride with the caravan because it was so like the long short of it.

30:16

I'm going to abandon his mother and Nickerson place part of the world. If we can tie back to the, uh, the players guide for this, the way that the stories tied together. It's Sandra's caravan that he got with his money back when he was adventuring with the same party that a mako made her money to buy the Rusty.

30:35

Dragon and coya is his adopted mother sanders adopted mother. So koi has been wanting to take a trip anyways. So she was like, down to go check out a Mako's thing. And then we all basically agree to do this together. So, sandru and Coya and amigo are all the same team to do the same thing.

30:52

It's not like sandra's coming. He's like i can make some money doing that but like, you know, primarily it's just like, yeah, i'll help out.

31:04

It's quite literally, the adventure of a lifetime. So, what's up? It's not, is happy. Decide you need anything from there when you toilet paper, really? All right, i'm sure. Well then we should get some rest and oh make our way down to the city tomorrow. A ton in the laundry room.

31:24

Okay, i'm missing. That's just text me, please. No, as i was saying you make your way down to, or do agony. You are stopped at the gates by guards who are not in any way hiding that they think you're fucking suspicious as fuck. Since a caravan coming out of the crown of the world in the off, season is an almost unheard of occurrence and they're examination.

31:54

Is maybe a little too strict and thorough dust swirling around them as they work and just as it looks like, the guards won't be allowing you to enter the city. A well-dressed man appears the gate from within the city itself and prostrates himself quite literally before you and says a bunch of dogs.

32:19

This thought of you rich, where is he? They didn't actually give me an entryway for the city to work with. So,

32:34

I literally just had just open. Where did it go?

32:47

Opportunity to god going through the stuff. No, it pixel pipe. One of them just like just like you've got to be kidding.

33:00

Oh, nothing with things.

33:16

Spoken. Yeah.

33:29

Basically appears at the front gate prostrates themselves. Honor guests. Welcome, welcome. In three welcomes more, please ignore the southern worms beneath your feet. Make sure you, they shall be punished for their insulins prince, but sucker that's the car. Bedside car. Bad sidecar goes, the norm of sunlight at the black portal of barberism bids.

33:55

You welcome to ordeal Eggenheim, the city of the edge of the world. My most munificent. Lord invites, his honored. Guests to his humble palace to rest. Dine are taken, polite conversation. And perhaps indulge in some pleasure, the golden one says he hopes, you will honor him with your clever speech from strange lens, a speech that he of all men.

34:18

In hungle has mastered is eager to hear of your journey across the crown of the world and this most difficult time of travel. Hello, i think we know which one of the types. This one. Is that real quick question? Is this ntm right? It isn't tien. Unless it looks like no one understands and then it's going to be in really bad comment.

34:43

No, i've like most of us two or three of us speak TN. So we could translate real quick. Yeah. Yeah. Um, oh Jill. Just turn around and uh, uh, oh shit. What's a good language? That maybe this person doesn't understand that. We all understand. Once everybody's languages keep in mind that most people only speak like two languages.

35:05

You know, i know, um, in cayen, maybe there's i feel like an emissary and a capital is just like, so this is going to go bad, right? Yeah. I think for resin might be a good one. Does everybody have? Yeah, it's true. Yeah, i do adversion. Okay. Oh chill.

35:25

Turn around in variety and say they most assuredly know who we are, and our inviting us to the palace to dine with someone who sounds like maybe the ruler here. And there are they're trying to get in good with someone who they think will be the future and for some mankind or they're trying to get in good with the current ruler of minkai by luring us into a trap.

35:47

Yeah. They're going to kill us or they're not doesn't matter. So we going with i will turn and address them again. And be like we would be most honored to see this and share our stories of our travels with your golden. I'm so sorry person. I missed that. What?

36:10

That's the golden lord. I'm sure the golden orbit sunlight at the black portal of barberism. The golden one, the golden one and OT will bow a little bit. He prostrates himself further and then stands up revealing. One, two, three, four. Four black roses and label one at omega speed.

36:39

No, his feet killed his feet and shall they lose feet. Looks like she might murder him if he gets too close. Yeah, again, i don't know which one of the two types. It is. Now there is no fire. Like the fire in the soles of the women of far lands, beauty is the wisdom of women and wisdom is the beauty of men.

37:01

So i may have misinterpreted this. Oh, she turns around and says, in Berezia. And this seems like some playboy. Dude, do just wants to um um love on some exotic women. Wow. You think?

37:21

Oh, we love magnets. We're lost. We lost magnets. Just because of how cringe, this is the situation, this guy just rolled up

37:55

You both dropped out at the same time did something just like blip the fucking arizona? Yeah that would be the phoenix internet. I'm sure because i tried to put it in, hello foundry and it disappeared also because i have literally, i lost discord and i try to enter, and it wouldn't go anywhere.

38:15

So y'all can hear me now. Yeah. Okay. So yeah. And you guys hear about the roses then. Yeah. I heard about them. You know i heard i i left off on the person saying uh he stood up to reveal and then you cut out he stood up to reveal four black roses that he blazes the feet of no way amicos shillelu and Kelda and says there is no fire like the fire in the souls of women of far lands.

38:45

Beauty is the wisdom of women and wisdom is the beauty of men.

38:52

From the golden one, very round about way of saying that women are his property.

39:02

Huh. You you do. Abby knows that women are practically second class citizens in hongo, right? Yeah. Okay. We're just why she says an out loud. Yeah.

39:18

And is deeply nonplussed by this gesture.

39:30

Um she'll go will cough uncomfortably. Um maybe we'll um what we'll see about that i guess. Uh, you do not wish to accept the princes invitation, um, Meridian, are we accepting or what? Um, getting bad. Get bad vibes off of this denying him would probably do you worse. Yeah, we we can handle ourselves, maybe we should just do it.

40:12

So it's to not make an enemy and then if they're fucking creep we can leave. Yeah, exactly. Like, no hypixel pics of like her black rose. Gives it a look over to make sure it's not poison. Um, it is not poisoned, it is just one of the rare black roses that only grow here, really

40:35

Well, it is quite an expensive gift and they she gets all that. Tell your prince would be delighted. Thank you for your hospitality. Um, while we're here though, you wouldn't happen to know the nearest say place where we might acquire a drink. It has been a long travel. If you would like to refresh yourself before, making your way to his eminence, there are several places in town that are worthy.

41:15

I will leave you to get ready and inform the prince of your imminent. Arrival for the first festivals this evening for the one for the lot. What, what did you just say? The prince intends to provide you with the full five feasts of hungle.

41:37

Choco knowledge. Check. Yeah yeah going to give me a knowledge geography. Uh, no way you can do a local. I don't want to, i don't have any buttons or i would probably roll one, too.

42:03

So, you both are aware that the five piece of hungle are given to royal guests. Uh, it is a feast a night over the course of five days. No way you are familiar with the particulars of it. There is the feast of three on the first night, uh, which is generally spicy, uh, the feasts of the ancient.

42:28

So on the second night which is steamed and or yeah, it's themes a lot of liquid things. The feast a fire is gonna be the hardest of things to eat and very spicy.

42:51

Uh a traditional thing that they serve on. It is thousand year old eggs, which are duck eggs coated, with lime, ashes, mud and soaked in horse urine for 100 days, centrix. Yeah. Yep. Just pinching her nose, just like, i see, uh, then the feast of the honored visitors where you all will be expected to take direction of the prince's household and prepare feasts and entertainment for him.

43:19

And all of his guests to share your culture with them. And then the final feast is the feast of the dragon which is a city-wide festival with the dance of the dragon. There will be fireworks and dancing dragon. Parades.

43:41

Uh, on that day you will get to eat all of the most delicious street fruit street foods of, or do oakenhagen high though, which are generally. Pretty good. Fourth pork fish, you written roasted snakehead. Live. Scorpion south some potent liquor? Like, all of the all of the street food.

44:05

Yeah, the only way that no, i will describe it will be to like turn to tell them. Just be like, you know, i'm in the jade quota. They used to have that little annual thing where they bring to really weird food out it's that. But over five days the new year's festival does ochi know that stuff with a 17.

44:29

No she only got it with the 20 dollars, local. Also you're on rolling privately. God damn it. Here we go. Again, with my geography, i got it. Uh,

44:44

You got what it was? She got more specifics on each festival. She only knows it because i mean he's a local and it's a hungle thing. It's, it's the type of particularly um, you said, like they want us but they do is annoying day. Three is worse before is, why am i eating this in day?

45:06

Five is, please tell me we get to have a nice candied fruit that you put on skewers. Yes, that is listed. Uh, what the, like into the tea? Like i think it was a tall gum. I think it is is uh it's like Tibetan just looking at it day.

45:20

Four is the worst one. We have to put on a festival. Yep. Oh. Oh yeah, i suppose that's the case. Because yeah, no. We we just had the opening is awful, do we have any lynorm? Should we go back and get some linorm? No, we could have brought the dragon but something.

45:43

Something sentient. Yeah, something something done. That's exactly how no way. Explains tears. Just like something. Something and someone someone mentioned food, oh, food would be great. We're gonna get some spicy. Turn down the sun please. It's so break. So we're gonna get you some spicy food and some liquor right now.

46:07

But hold on. There's nothing you won't eat og passes in the deep like seriously? Like like anything you draw a line OG passes grace in the tengo drinking jerk so he can start to take some hair of the dog. Here we go. Angula, uh, sugar things. Anything i won't eat.

46:35

Um, here's the list of all of the delicious street food that i would eat the fuck out of. If i ever got to go to this place, uh, except maybe the fried milk because that has curdled milk in it and i just can't imagine how that tastes good. Personal decline, the the thing from ochieving like no no no alcohol.

46:58

I don't want to die.

47:04

Come on. That's all right, buddy. That's that's not until minkai uh here in here in hong goal. You're fine. We're in homegirl. What's the difference? A country's. Oh yeah, yes actually. So hey last night was it? Oh,

47:28

We won't be in minka until after we crossed through the forest, okay? Standard rice noodles, spicy. Soups horse sausages. Fried fried milk which is stir fried chicken liver and ham in egg whites and curdled milk to just sounds disgusting me. Okay, or worse here? Yes. Uh, fried rabbit tangola which are the skewers candy fruit and woodier a type of local fungus dried and eaten as a snack.

47:57

That i believe tastes a lot like morel mushrooms. The chicken of the forest. What year is actually like super nice? Especially in in stews is probably like, yeah, it's really good. If you haven't been like noodle bowls and then in addition to normal street food found, in order to eigenheim of the feast foods include horse hoof, gruel that sounds gross deer which are fried rats.

48:26

I smells like fish pork, pork cooked with woody or mushrooms and green, hot peppers. Cured, roasted sparrows, snakehead, soup, and live scorpions, douse and potent, liquor are all available during the feast of the dragon is about to get away. It ever land. Uh but you guys can go into town first and since you did not refuse the princess invitation, we could actually use shopping.

48:54

We won't get assassinated in the street. Uh, if you turn down his invitation, he orders the entire city, not to sell to you, that's horrifying. Why? Because he's the prince of hungle. As a horse prince of hungle, this AP is fucking tortured. Okay? We have been unable to sell for slick, two and a half books.

49:21

It's not true. We sold almost everything at that. Um that place before the bridge area whatever. So i'm not copy and paste this, um, Ashoko at asked everyone. So when we talked, there we go. Uh, i can already tell he's probably going to be a creep. We all know that we can't punch him, right?

49:52

We can't cause an international once or stab him or poison him. Oh, she says, look at no way i kick him.

50:06

It's trying to to not along to the distinctions but also looks aggressive. Like, no it. If i'm not allowed to rip out of spine, you're not allowed to break it in half, all right? So, here's a beautiful thing. Look at that base value and purchase limit. And here is your list of pre-rolled items.

50:30

Hell yeah.

50:38

Oh, that's some good stuff. Mmm. Oh, there's a set of celestial armor on there. Uh, instead of chainmail. That's probably like to tell me dough armor, it just makes more sense. I'm just gonna point out.

50:57

Are not time. I know that's the happy plate. Go to the media barber real quick.

51:13

It would be four mirror armor instead of chainmail. They have the exact same stats. Slightly different weight.

51:33

You know, if you guys want to sort of hurry and i'm such i guess, now's a fairly didn't time to do it. Um, are we okay? The big question i guess would be are we keeping the that ghost mirror armor and or are we keeping that nine-fold spirit sword?

51:52

Those are the big two selling items a lot. Shoko wanted to keep the nine ring broth or the spirit sword. Yeah, i wanted to keep the spirit sword and i wanted to put basically all of my money into giving it the agile enchantment. And also getting am a an effortless lace for it?

52:17

Okay, a problem here. Loot list. Make sure it's on your sheet. Yeah, you got to carry it around. Now anyone anything for the ghost mirror armor? Yeah, i no heavy armor wears in this group. Nope, not even a little bit.

52:42

Everything else. So uh, everything else that we got is marked for sale. Give me a minute. How many day from mountain to ordu?

52:59

One and a half. Okay, i'm wearing very patiently for my grace and crafty

53:13

Saw that there was a, a, a plus 4. Shifters headband on the list, i looked it up and i was like, oh, that seems like it would feel a show. But i saw the first line, uh, this band of reddish fox fur is marked on the front and i'm like, hmm.

53:33

Not sure he'd be comfortable wearing that it seems like something the the honla would do the a little bit. Yeah. Actually, what is it the headbands of agility or headband shop? He's just holding the band of red fur and little tears or whaling up in the corner. There will be some kits and there's like what?

53:59

We're not actually like boxes, they're a whole different thing.

54:05

Um, you know that Hong Kong? Oh. They told they would have it. Yeah. And the, the steps kitsune that are probably from this area are probably the ones that made it.

54:21

It's practical very much. So, i mean if you have to kill a fox, you might as well use all the parts. Yeah.

54:41

Yeah, if you guys are starting that out. Um, not no actually will like do a quick runs on and just see what the current pulse of things is more specifically isman died. We're gonna do some gathering of information, good gathering of information because uh, yeah. Struggles gonna help out with that too.

55:06

Because, all right, i'm gonna try and be like, i'm local. I come from the other end of hungry. What's happening? Give me hush. Shoko could do that too. But with just a few ultra selves, exactly

55:25

There's a treat materials. We can. By which, i mean, you'll succeed and i will do my usual roles

55:38

Well, they also have celestial armor here that's like the best light armor. Uh, the best armor in the game and i'm really trying not to look at it. I'm really trying to forget.

56:01

Um, nice cold spirit sword. How much does it cost for me to get that agile enchantment?

56:11

So for the most part, you get polite smiles. When you start asking questions and our pointed to a tea house, uh, when asked for an armor shop or they smile and Nope. Okay.

56:44

Okay, everybody gets 10,470 gold. I have also typed it out in. Um, a good chat. You are a absolute god. Thank you. Uh and that includes things like converting platin to gold and converting up copper and silver in the gold so that if as much as possible. So you were given a lot of polite smiles and directions.

57:12

As far as things happening in minkai. Most of the general populace, don't seem to know like the broader range of global politics doesn't really matter to the hungle people. That's fun. Well maybe in that case, then here with pivot and ask my details about the esteemed prince of our first city.

57:43

Uh on that one. You get a lot of things that sound a bit like there is no war embossing. Say, i figured that might be the

57:56

So everywhere you go, you pass smiling locals, all of whom are so anxious to please the prince's new guests that they tell you exactly what they think you wish to hear. And if you want directions to a magic shop and a local doesn't know the way they're likely to make up directions.

58:12

So it's not to seem in polite. Okay, so what if we don't look like new people?

58:25

That just the two of you. Yeah, give me a disguise check.

58:40

I might be able to do a bit better than that. I roll the seven like it's true.

58:50

And then you roll the 19. I, i like to think, but notice the sky's check is not that great because this is just no way because not much the sky is going on here. Hi. And also the plus 10 on top of that because altar cell, right? That's how that's works.

59:09

So the capital of the nation of hongo or do eigenheit is also the northeasternmost city in tea on jet lies on the edge of the articles arctic Circle and is an oasis of luxury and hospitality in an icy desert of despair. The city is famed for its thermal hot springs which have formed a sulfur rimmed lake in the center of the city frequent entire residents and visitors alike.

59:33

Prince best. That's like car. Someone help me with, that's close to time.

59:47

It's like okay, younger brother of the con of hungle. He is not just a horse prince of hungle. He is the younger brother of the pun of hungle rules, or do agony called the golden one by his subjects who live in both. Awe and terror of him, he is a man known to smile and sing.

01:00:07

As he has, those is a man known to smile and sing as he is, as he has those who have angered him if he has those thing. Okay, is a man known tooth silencing as he has had those who have anchored him toward apart, that's how that sentence is supposed to be enunciated.

01:00:33

Parent between south timber walls, 40 feet, high topped with spikes, replete with the severed, heads of bandits who preyed upon the path of agony. The city's layout is confusing with narrow winding streets. Buildings, are timber framed, and have high gabbled routes, and ornate, decorative. Eaves, a large park-like gardens surrounds or do agonized central lake which lies more or less in the middle of the city.

01:00:58

The park is flanked on one side by the prince, the pals of the prince of forbidden place guarded by hundreds of soldiers, and on the other, by the temple of avatar known in. Tianzia as the god of walls and ditches paper lanterns light, the streets of ordo, agony at night in the streets are immaculately clean and regularly.

01:01:21

Patrolled rare flags with all colors dancing. The wind from every gavel and roof everywhere. One turns a shop is selling something and the heady scent of incense mingles of the smell of unfamiliar cooked foods on the city's outskirts. Huge court, corrals, contain herds of price hungkol, pangali horses and numerous caravansaries cater to the caravans coming down from the crown of the world.

01:01:45

Currently, there's only one caravan in the care of us. Well, there's probably a couple that are getting ready to make the trip. It's just centered. I just love how it was. Just,

01:02:02

And that is the current extent of the day today of ordo agony. So the prince is fickle. He? Yes, it's fickle. Yeah, seems to have a like of foreign exoticism. How's the usual? John law problem of believing superiority and has reason to do that because he's functionally tendigan, okay?

01:02:36

He also loves entertainment from what he calls the west. It is well known that he likes exotic things. That's so.

01:02:54

And then of course everyone here eats with chopsticks. Okay, and street performances are common with dangerous acts being the most popular walking in tightrope, over barrels of scorpions dodging arrows and other missiles wrestling. And martial arts displays, such as coping through boards, with hands or feet breaking stones with headbuts punching walls and balancing for hours over hot coals.

01:03:18

I was about to say grayson. Once i want to have the best of times here, then i had that i went never mind. Um, i have a question about the marketplace. It says um i'm looking up what it costs to get a plus, three weapon enchanted. And uh, it says, i found a rule that says, i need somebody with a caster level three times, the enhancement bonus.

01:03:42

So i would need someone with caster level 9. Um, it's it's a spell casting six. Does that mean they could cast six levels spells or they are sixth levels. But six levels spells, okay? But not, then i would be able to find someone. See all nine. Probably. Oh, i should give you that sword back, actually.

01:04:08

I think it's still an omico. Uh yeah i just added it to my sheet again. No, i gave it its own token. Okay. Okay, well i will delete my my my inferior version.

01:04:35

Uh, and as for time, uh, one day for each 1000 gold pieces and the price of its magical features. Uh, but you are not going up to a plus three because it's also a ghost such remember. Yeah. So you would be going up to a plus four always go such plus two.

01:05:04

Wait wait no, no wait no. Okay. Never mind like it has a posterior enhancement bonus, right? And then it's got yes, i don't know why i got ghost such as a plus too much. No no, it's a plus one. It's a plus one go such so you're going, never mind.

01:05:21

You're good, you're right?

01:05:26

Yeah. Um and agile is a plus one bonus. Are there any modifiers? You're adding agile, you are going up to a plus four. Here's a quick question, but it's it's only plus two right now. Then you say, you're adding another enhancement bonus. That's what i meant. I'm adding the the plus one from agile.

01:05:54

Oh, okay. The number one karaoke, here's a question, is there any other modifier besides having the purchase value of an item to get the cell value for things that aren't like weapons in armor, like al chemical stuff? I'm trying to offload all my cold weather shit and also doesn't have price things like gems and art objects of the things that sell mostly at full price.

01:06:20

I just want to make sure there wasn't funky stuff for like a heat stone or a campfire bead Oh, but those are still just meant to happen.

01:06:39

Fine. Okay, let's see. What did we get? On our gather information. Uh, you didn't ask them. Oh i was tapped out in the pdf uh so i can run local and whatever that'll be. You may use diplomacy or knowledgeable, i'll try diplomacy. Uh, and we're just asking about minkai, right?

01:07:13

Uh, the situation of minkai and the road ahead. Yeah. Oh no way. My game just decided to reload. So i don't know what it did. You got a crit? You you did. Uh, so you guys managed to get all of the information about minkai in the road ahead. So here we go.

01:07:35

The first bitch, an ancient place called the force of spirits lights between hungle and minkai. The forest is known to be haunted. So the main road to minkai called the spirit road skirts, the forest, the south and west loyal samurai of minkai, Jade region patrol, the spirit road in great numbers, to keep it open.

01:07:51

And safe, the jade region. Samurai, patrols are far more likely to rub you than protect. You, you are told though, with going over the dc, 20, and many caravans have disappeared on the spirit road. Although many people blame the haunted forest of spirits for this appearance. Others claim that jade region's troops.

01:08:11

A small army of kumba patrol along the road or responsible dc 25, uh, knowledge logo whiskers of rebellion or outright civil war are coming out of minkai. The emperor is in hiding and he has not been seen in public for years now and his appointed vice wrote Roy. The jade region is far from a popular ruler, many groups.

01:08:35

Now oppose the jade region and they could topple him if they ever joined together.

01:08:44

That is a lot of sad information. And one small amount of actually very good information year that the spirit of minkai has not been quenched. Things are much worse than i remember them.

01:09:06

Then you should wrap me up in something. It would not do for this prince to see me if the whispers of rebellion of grown that big. That's that growing out loud. That's good news for us. Oh, when i left, everyone was like me too scared to do anything, scared to say anything.

01:09:38

Well, bob like you, they've come to realize the error of that mistake and perhaps with some fight encouragement and something to rally behind though, consider the alternative.

01:10:01

Conversation for later. I'm not a nail.

01:10:09

But if i'm understanding correctly, basically the the path like the spirit red is basically shock a block with jade region soldiers. Yes, indeed.

01:10:32

Um, Is it possible to take another path through the forest?

01:10:42

Uh, people don't in general.

01:10:49

First time. Uh, both statements are true in galaria. Oh, just saying i well i noticed that there's a river. It is there. No possibility of just taking a boat down the river.

01:11:12

Asshoka was asking these he's just oh, she's just gonna say, people don't go into the forest. The last people who really did. They don't exist anymore. Oh, i know full. Well, how dangerous the forest is? It's just, i'm waiting our options here. It's either we risk the dangers of the forest or we was risk.

01:11:37

The dangers of direct confrontations with the armies of the jade region. Samurai, i would much sooner face regular men than face. What's said, before his spirits. And if i have an option, i would choose, neither there's got to be something that's that we can.

01:12:04

Getting into another location with about spirits stopped quite enough. Ghosts, on the way here.

01:12:20

How much is a potion of fly? Uh, third level spell 750.

01:12:38

You can always try to charter a boat. There's nothing at the moment, actually solving you from doing so. Well, we would have to leave the caravan behind if we did that. There's that.

01:12:57

And besides, it's not like there's an the impossible likelihood of that root being under the eye a video edition. It's not like they won't have already thought of what would be the optimal roots in and out of mankind to keep an eye on.

01:13:29

Thought about the same things we're doing right now. Over tea. That's marriage. I turned the coya. Don't suppose. There's another. Secret hidden tunnel that'll lead us right under our enemies.

01:13:45

Not that i have been made aware of fortunately. Yeah. Um, that trick does seem a little too convenient for designer to pull twice.

01:14:07

It does seem to be her prerogative though. Well, well, i was out and about doing my investigation. I discovered some interesting things about the forests of spirits that we might want to consider.

01:14:24

Uh, so from what i understand, it's existed, since the dawn of all things. And it's not a place for people or at least this one. Most people seem to think no one really lives there though. Uh and only the spirit wrote bypassed it. But i found this woman who was reading the bones and we really clicked and she told me that the force of spirits is not really haunted.

01:14:52

It's the birthplace of the coming.

01:14:59

The the comedy like the, all right.

01:15:09

Um, choco does already know quite a bit about the forest. Spirits. Um, at least i would think he would, he would be someone interested in learning about it considering he's, uh, kind of from the outskirts of there. There are. Kitsune communities in the forest of spirits. If i'm not mistaken, there shouldn't be anyone living in the horse, the spirit squirting.

01:15:33

This i know the kitchen making pass through it. Maybe that's what i'm confusing it. With there is an entry on the wiki page about small communities. But the but it what the ap says takes president.

01:15:58

They can be found deeper into the forest but they they don't live all throughout the forest. No, no. I think they're just deeper than humans are willing to make because kids make can be friendly with comedy. They knew actually know how to live in harmony with them.

01:16:15

That's all i was saying is like maybe his people his people, it makes sense for sure, go to know about it. It's not a lot of people go. There they go, on the south road, but on the spirit road but they don't really go in.

01:16:30

I need to actually finish right now. Show goes backstory. Now, god damn it. I like this came up faster than i thought it would. I like i made the character the end of book one. I was like i want plenty of time to to write out the backstory. I'll just put it off for now and i'll just put it off for now.

01:16:46

I'll just put like it's all in my head but it's i never actually wrote it out.

01:16:54

Well, anyway, let's still look where you did with her day. If you guys were all looking brother stuff,

01:17:02

A problem. Really good food and candies oranges.

01:17:10

Uh i found a magical weapon sweat that i interested the priceless artifact too. Uh hopefully he can make it usable for me by the time we have to leave. How long is that gonna be? What's the the price difference from two to four? From two to three? Oh, and it's a, it's 10k.

01:17:34

So, 10 days. Oh,

01:17:43

Well hopefully the prince won't mind us stepping on his time for such a bit. Yeah, aberration. Well, he's got us for at least five possible. Small showcode says, khelda, i need you to fuck this guy so we can stay in his house. So, my sword can get finished working on.

01:18:08

I mean the rest of you can go on without me if you all need to skedaddle uh write it after the, that's the festival's done. I can survive here for a few days with just a by just laying a little waiting it out, and then dash up to meet the rest, you know?

01:18:29

By yourself. Oh it's just. All right. Um, i gotta i gotta go bathroom. Sure wouldn't be that hard. Um,

01:18:58

And to be fair, shuttle is 10th level at this point. There are few people in the world, who would be more comfortable traveling alone for a little bit? Oh, i don't doubt it.

01:19:13

As as a fellow player. Uh, yeah. No. You you would probably be fine, no way. However is a way that you have five strengths and recently we'll kicked off a cliff to your possibly Patrick uh, our lives debt. So yeah. Yeah. Uh, undue amounts of concern from your local ninja, who would have guessed

01:19:43

Though, if we start running into more assassins, uh, all bets are off, right?

01:19:53

Yeah. I have kind of locked myself to a commitment here, which is unfortunate.

01:20:13

I did not like the tone of voice that daddy and had when i told them that i needed to be here for 10 days button voice told me oh oh, what the pcs? Get chased out by guards on day six. Great. That is that is very much the bm tone of.

01:20:36

Well, just means you're going to have to sneak back in. If it doesn't go assuming that whoever you give the sword to work on the first place isn't told to stop working on it. Yeah, that's the more concerning part for me. I could have used this guy's self to talk to him.

01:20:59

That is about that. If you're what you serendipitate, having fun, but that was

01:21:10

It's not like the foreign weapon or anything.

01:21:20

Bigger, which i can nearly afford that. Celestial llama.

01:21:29

Oh well i have other far more important thing.

01:21:35

I mean, if you need some extra gold, i'm sure we can piece together some

01:21:45

I can't. I had to sell shit to buy one item. What was your one item boots? Flying boots. That's why. Yeah, i'm tired of this on TV on the ground and having to use his wrist, peashooter nonsense.

01:22:08

Yeah, but i feel like it's going to happen more often. Now, am i out of line, buying a 16k item, where's the purchase stuff? Where is it at? It's possible. I'm not your damn, i don't know, but i have to roll. Okay, that's fine. I'll roll for it.

01:22:41

On the royal bodyguards. An absolute chad though. It's remain is an 11th level of sunrise.

01:22:58

Oh, wow. Yeah, i'm actually like almost triple the base value so that might be difficult.

01:23:11

I'm trying.

01:23:22

That is a massive population of tengo. Yeah, it's pretty large. Doesn't fungal border. Um, i forget what it's called though. It's going to nation it borders. One line. Yes. And i think it's the one that's right here on the other side of these mountains. If you look at the map, i think it's.

01:23:39

Yeah. I think it's i think it's literally just like over or like this way. This is true. Eh, the cool. Oh yeah. Sorry it's um one down from that. I think. Because it's on the coast. It's like it's like yeah it's around this area, isn't it? Yeah. Cool. Thank you.

01:23:56

Flavor is there's supposedly like a lost ancient city in there called the city of whistling swords. Uh, o g's apple log as he goes there to find a cool sword. Probably dies.

01:24:12

So if i can't buy these stupid boots, what should i buy then? Oh, some potions are useful. Just in general. Um, the celestial armor gives you flying once a day, it does not stack with my build. I gotta have that char to ac and i can only have it.

01:24:33

When i have no room, i am a warrior poet. And i actually took back ninja levels to get more warrior poet. So i'm pretty invested. How dare you my child, AC will eventually be super even better though. Imagine having AC says, no. Imagine what is it for?

01:25:09

Um, is foreign wand of a second level still.

01:25:18

I should tell us.

01:25:33

Hello, second level. What 4.5, i think. Yep, 4,500 for 50 charges.

01:25:52

I know i sense i said i talked about using my money to buy a bunch of magical items to use with stoko's UMD. Um, literally spent all of my money on making the sword usable for me, by the way, i don't remember if i showed you guys a bigger picture of the bunny, this she's very cute.

01:26:11

Incredibly fluffy Monet. What is the cool green magic through scarf and magic. She's an emissary familiar. Cool. So i still don't know how pathfinder works. So i sold some stuff to try and buy winged boots and as way above the base value wanted to talk to you about that sans.

01:26:37

Can i roll too bad boots? Winged boots for 16k?

01:26:50

Pretty sure that is half of the purchase limit of this city. Don't be scroll back to who. I think the purchase limit is what they can buy and the base value is under what amount i can buy without rolling was my understanding and the value. So base value is basically everything within reason the up to that price, you can find obviously within reason between that value.

01:27:20

And the purchase limit, the purchase limit is the absolute maximum that you can get your hands on but you're gonna have to look around specialty stores. Ask some people order it please. It's a 75% chance that it's available immediately, if not, it can be acquired, also, ochia Grayson can craft.

01:27:43

Those Kenny. Yeah, tailoring and leatherworking stuff. It's true. There is a pair available, though. Okay, well, i'm gonna craft them because they are wings slippers though. Not boots, throwing caddy. Yeah. Winged chancla yeah i will go ahead and throw it on the sheet for Grayson to craft because i don't need them right now.

01:28:10

Right now i just wanted to make sure that i bought them before. I you want to melee the dragons when they fly we just we know what you're actor as before i drop all the money on the key stuff here in the next couple of levels. I was like, i should buy the boots because i'm going to be standing on the ground with my aura flaring around me.

01:28:28

Unable to do anything.

01:28:33

Okay, well, i know happy and Joe and know what you're here. The gracement comes back from all this. Just a big big bag full of crafting material stuff. Oh, gosh, he's gonna spend like every night crafting forever forever. There is a very good reason why? I'm not having to craft my stuff.

01:28:55

Your card was making enough. Well, if we if we actually stop traveling and we like sit in the city for a while or something like he can do it much faster. Yeah, well shoco's gonna go home to get around. We we had this conversation, um, in case like we accidentally piss off the, the golden one.

01:29:21

And, uh, you tell us all the the people in town to stop doing business with us, when shojo does business with the uh, with the uh, the weaponsmith that he finds, he uses ultra self to appear as a uh, traveling monk from the south. Um, so i mean you don't really have any way of knowing that's the punishment.

01:29:49

He will provide that was out of character. Oh, you did say that.

01:29:59

Okay, if it comes to that it comes back, it doesn't i i just and yeah i'm if you upset the only way you're going to upset him is if you don't go to, it's festivals. Yeah yeah. Let's let's all be real here. We're going to the party but also no i heard they actually have hot springs here.

01:30:19

I'm gone, right? Oh yes they do. They have the best hot springs in. Hungle here, beautiful. Spring water heated in the mountains. Showgo is all also immediately gone. Yeah, chock. Full of minerals and sulfur and stuff. Don't drink it. Don't don't drink that please but it's full of good minerals.

01:30:45

Not. That's healthy. Okay. I think another one on the grace and make sure that it's legal. It's going to go check it. And then i was reading the description. I was like, i think i is the necklace of key serenity. Subscribe. The simple leather cord. I allow it. I love that.

01:31:08

I'll allow it. Perfect. This is cheating. That's what crafting is especially if you're not eating because it because i have to be so nitpicky with the profession checks, it's not cheating. Grayson that has his leveling up multiple training, progressions. Now, to expand what he can and cannot make. He's still got a shit ton of items.

01:31:32

He can't make. Oh sure, i'm just ochie. Doesn't have those feets. I'm getting most of my stuff half off that is the benefit. You're having a crafter in adventuring party though. Yeah so and you don't have one in every adventuring party you certainly don't. I would imagine i mean raft doesn't have a crafter so i don't even know what was really strange would do with himself in this big city if everyone's running off.

01:32:01

Okay, you'd probably stick around a mako, since we're getting closer and closer to minkai and the, the women folk in general. Because horny prince guy. It's really just hungle horny hungle, but pretty much. Yeah, my woman uh, shoko shoko is going to have to bear the brunt here because he feels bad for you guys.

01:32:27

So we're going to have a final fantasy 7 style mini game, where we go around getting shoko like a dress and like makeup and a wig. Still told me don, corneo, the golden one.

01:32:46

Oh, before we do that, amazing, i'm gonna ask a loaded question. Um, it is related to the loop thing. It's kind of the other thing that i'm sort of interested in getting right now, just tell me whether or not, i can find a headband of ninjutsu, i need to look at that again.

01:33:05

I forgot about that again. I roll.

01:33:14

Christmas. Roll 75 on the dog fucking barely, which you're like about to give up on the search when you get pulled into a side alley. Buy a fucking ninja. Who's like the cool ninja, you know, like you can tell they're jonin. They're like, what are you doing? What a wonderful question.

01:33:46

Making a force of everything and also trying to find like certain resources because, you know, i had fully expect to be stopped in the back by either you or someone that is part of your client, which is going to be paid to stop us in the back. I'm not part of the private storms and they'll thank you to apologize for the inference.

01:34:10

Browsers, definitely silence.

01:34:18

Then what business have you got here?

01:34:27

The dark phoenix. Land likes to keep an eye on the politics of pungle.

01:34:36

There are some in minkai who are still concerned that the horse lords will be dissatisfied with their current territory.

01:34:49

And what are you doing here? From your gate and walk. I can tell you weren't trained in any clan on this side of the sea.

01:35:05

That doesn't say mine and that's, it won't be interfering.

01:35:16

What do you need?

01:35:20

I've heard of certain items that have been abused with the power. Focus key into your strikes. Specifically goes that are

01:35:33

This mantling to one's anatomy. Want to do with corn, juicy practices than anything else, you heard of it familiar? And probably get you one as well. I'm quickly. You need it. We're here for at least the next five days beyond that don't ask. You're going to be the ones for the festival.

01:36:02

Got it. I'll have it for you in a couple of days. You too kind. I'm not have the money when i get back.

01:36:15

Shrug and they just managed back into the shadows.

01:36:26

Oh my god, it would have just stabbed me. Just started pineapple pomegranate tea. Um, after umuchi comes to grace in the like request a couple things Grayson will be like, oh gee. I got a question for you and uh this has to do with one of the things you want me to craft babies boots.

01:36:53

Um, okay. He pulls out a small bag and opens it and shows the contents to occasions like these. Um, can i with your permission? I'd like to use these on them and oh she sees that say the bag filled with blood red raven feathers to craft them. Absolutely. I would love nothing more to fly on the wings of that fucking asshole.

01:37:23

I just wanted to to make sure since uh you kind of got pissed at me when i when i took them. Yes, i thought about it a lot more. He was a terrible bird.

01:37:41

All right. All right. Well, it'll be a little while before it gets home, but uh oh i'll make sure they're included. Thank you for asking. Um, do you just keep a list of all the things we've killed and the stuff you've taken off of it for rp reasons like this?

01:37:56

Yeah, i've got bra strikes in you from those frost tricks. We killed outside that, uh, winter witches had, uh, i'm got a bunch of parts from that weight dragon. And then we used to have those plates from the, the bullets. But we are selling those because man nobody uses heavy armor in our groups.

01:38:17

That's really, really cool. I'm glad you're doing that. Yeah, he's been doing it for a while but i think if i could wrap on, oh, she's rp thing of like, well, they weren't doing any good where they were, you know what i mean? Like waste, not why not?

01:38:36

Ah indeed. Um yeah and Grayson will stick close to Kelda just because of the whole gender thing and it also helps that he is actually bought materials to craft two magic items for hers gifts. There's nothing major, a cloak of resistance plus one. And then a scabbard of vigor.

01:38:55

Did we? I never get it. I never did the gloves of arcane striking for a mako yet, huh? We that didn't go on there. I did the tassel instead. Yeah, and i think we figured out. They were leather, that's right. Yeah that's what it was. Okay now it's good thing we didn't hear them because i would have been not as useful at this point.

01:39:18

That's true. Um also does she still have our kids right? I need to get new clothes. Doesn't makeo still have arcane strike does so she could still use them because she's got those three palette levels.

01:39:40

Sugar. What do you mean? I need new clothes in case it looks down and he's wearing another like a set of those shizuku. Um nice one shizuku the night wind. Yeah. That he made himself that generally similar to the one that no way has. But just with some personal flares and touches to it.

01:40:03

Instead, i'm saying that because we're about to go meet the lord of the city. He probably expects us to dress uh, somewhat formally.

01:40:16

Well, what? What constitutes formal wear here? Shoko opens his mouth scratches at his beard a second. Um, oh no, probably something like this any pictures in his eyes. Uh was one of the more fancier folk he met on the streets. Well gathering information and then he tugs on his sleeves and uh is all of a sudden in much nicer clothing, that is period and setting appropriates.

01:40:57

But, um, that description doesn't help me in the slightest. I know.

01:41:04

Or shall pick? You up something crazy. We'll get you a nice sorority made. You might want to get fitted for an actual set of actually, no, no. You'd look pretty terrible in the book. Uh, i'll figure it out by the way. I finally come up with Kelda's spoon that she will grant for those like get close enough with her.

01:41:30

She provides the plus two attack and damage rolls for things with dragon subtype. Hell. Yeah, it is grayson close enough to have that bonus. Oh yeah, i already threw it on your sheet, huh? Okay. He didn't get your practically married at this point. You spent so much time with her.

01:42:07

I can't actually afford the jewelry to go with a quarter years outfit after buying all my cool new stuff, but i could pick us up some, uh, quarter years outfits in the style because OT would know what to look for. And he'll measure Grayson and go pick him up one, um, but if you don't wear jewelry with it, don't work.

01:42:30

I'm sorry. It says, if you wear it with 50 gold pieces of jewelry,

01:42:42

Increase and pulls out a very small coin pouches like ah, this is all i got. And it's like the people in it. Yeah, i well at the very least we'll just look shabby that's fine. No jewelry. But i'll pick up the clothes. You can throw a courtyards outfit on your sheet, okay?

01:43:06

I mean, generally gracing tries to keep pretty good like cleanliness of of himself. That's part of his monk stuff. No, absolutely. Oh, she's like the same way but show goes, right, we should dress up a little bit for this. It is a festival basically in our honor. Well, if you can see me, he wins a prize for that.

01:43:28

Yes, by which noah gives the implication of i really don't in the descendancy.

01:43:44

I want to be involved with the royals choco and ochie. Is this something where i should just like, not talk at all.

01:43:59

Well, he'll be expecting something from each of us, honestly. Um, oh, to bring a gift. Oh uh, more of a culture share. I was going to, which is present on the night of the fourth beast. Yeah, you have time.

01:44:26

Uh, i just want to share that. This is what i got when i looked up mongolian formal clothing. Yeah, i feel likely well it's kind of a i feel like i feel like there's a i feel like there's something a little out of place here. I can't quite put my finger on it.

01:44:46

That's entirely in bad. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, she make sure you come back with one of those hats that they got. Oh she says okay wearing his gingasa the entire campaign. Get a fancier. Yeah, i'll get you a hat. They're like, wait, i'm seeing more than one pictures of them in these our actually?

01:45:12

Yes. Oh yes. The mongols had horses. And cowboy hats. The americans did not invent them that would be okay. I did not know that i'll buy you a hat too grease. And you can have a two absolutely delights me to find out how few things Americans, thought they invented.

01:45:38

That they didn't put a put a hat on your sheet. You're wearing a cool hat. Okay. Do you need the, you need some gold to help pay for this? No, this is the very end of mine. I was like, i'll buy the outfits and then i'm tapped. You and me got new threads.

01:45:54

And i'm pretty much dead. All right, christian knows so little about local stuff that holds where whatever you tell him, that's exactly like ochi will kind of vegan look around and figure out, you know, what's in fashion and stuff and he picks up one that's tailored for you and gets you a nice hat, and then he gets one for himself, so that we look very dapper going into our festival.

01:46:16

Uh, oh, uh, crystal also spend some extra money and make sure that Calder gets um, closed too. Though i mentioned she has her own money. Uh, she does. I i don't really wear one of their dresses.

01:46:40

Do i do i have to where my armor? I have no idea that the showcode desperately. No. Um, is there any way? I will say, based on my impression of this, this golden lord, i think that it might add to the exoticness and the appeal to him, i don't know if that's something we want to lean into or lean away from, but it's a really good assumption.

01:47:11

Actually, there's the merit of the Viking woman from across the world, that i think, might not so much offend him as intrigued him. If what if we call her or like something like a bodyguard with that helped them, like leave the them alone? Um, no just make sure your armor is a nice and polished.

01:47:38

I guess maybe that'll be enough. Uh, khelda and chaletu are pretty much constantly having their hair touched while they're in town until shillelu actively starts hiding there. Because because if she doesn't, she's gonna start shooting people, tell that has no such luck at disguising. Her blonde hair. I warned you.

01:48:05

But yes, the the Viking woman will get you through a lot of doors actually which is now but i'm thinking about it. Probably why Kelvin never joined the caravan in the original writing.

01:48:21

Or does she go after we safer in the original? Maybe to her family? Yeah, yeah. She lives there. So noise invisible, i don't believe in her outfit. Soleilu probably is okay. In her outfit too. A mako is a mako gonna get all fancy done. Speaking of families, the live here.

01:48:42

I feel like we should address this. Does no way have any family in agonheim? Probably not that she would know based on reading her backstory important. She wouldn't know. Yeah, there might be some cousins around or aunts and uncles but i don't even think the family relation would be very good.

01:49:03

Would it shouldn't come up? The only thing that she vaguely knows, uh, whether or not the dm chooses to use this, um, but now talk line is spread pretty thinly across most of kencha. Um, her father had to come back to hungao when she was quite young and she hasn't heard anything since they don't really work, any like, in cells larger.

01:49:34

So she wouldn't be surprised if they just if i she never comes across them, keep that you could ask quiet to find your dad for you. I bet, but i could

01:49:53

You've seen knowing angry, you have not seen, like, whatever god damn expression. You've just done. Ah, no apps. No. Okay. That's fair.

01:50:13

You don't murder me in my sleep.

01:50:20

I don't want to have to kill another one. Should we be able to assume that sandra's been buying and selling as he goes to make himself a profit or should have? We just been like using his wheels to get all the way across the world without any profit for him.

01:50:37

No, he's he's definitely made his own profit. He's i bet he's been wheeling and dealing the whole way and drinking and gambling the whole time.

01:50:47

Yeah, the rest of us are going to come out of this, like, fucking broke ass murder. Hobos. And Sandra is going to be the only one who made any money.

01:51:01

Oh, i'm just said it was well from the dark phoenix clan. Yeah. Can we get a check on that? What? I i need to ask if he can get me a hold of something else while he's at,

01:51:17

This your fault.

01:51:25

Okay. RIP shoko. I'll start making my own no.

01:51:34

I need you to get me a, a sort of kitsune ban.

01:51:45

Directed.

01:51:52

I'm not going to get a sort of consumer van, and i've just double checked and i can afford the same way. It's fine. It doesn't need to be rudeful. So, it's fun.

01:52:09

Are we ready to party or what? It sounds like a couple more purchasing things. You still happening? It's free since then.

01:52:28

Oh cheese. Then sugar done. See? Yeah. Yeah. We're done, excellent.

01:52:41

Like car, you head to the princess floating palette?

01:53:42

Everyone. See the map? Yeah, i can. And this is nice music. Uh, it's a little loud. I'll just turn it down. Turn down my headphone everybody. Take off your buffs.

01:54:02

And bison is still unconscious from drinking. I will turn the volume down because they're all new sound vials, i loaded in specifically for this scene. Oh dear, i'm not sure what the little swirly purple thing erase it.

01:54:27

Uh, you might have that on a token on another map somewhere. It's not again. All right. Well, i still have that. I think that attitude here is less check, that probably won't work because i think whatever that is is associated an actual module about it would have been on the caravan that i've added keep us.

01:54:54

But i don't remember. I have anything that had this on it. No, i don't see anything on that.

01:55:03

Okay, pulling your character onto the map again.

01:55:23

Doesn't work. I'm just going to turn off that module because it seems glitched the, the new toes. Can i pull that doesn't have it rotating on them? Excellent and that one can go away.

01:55:43

Fifth. Here's the entrance.

01:55:51

So, what you will lead the train up to the entrance here? Oh should we not bring our weapons? I was gonna ask that and i forgot. Yeah. Yeah we still need to go over a few things actually. Yeah. One do we bring our weapons to? What do we tell this guy?

01:56:11

Like why? We're here you we just say that on my code for future empress.

01:56:23

Um didn't know she's our local guide that we hired returning with sandre's caravan. Do we have surgery with this? Can we bring sandru for this? This story. I'm about to make up right now. I'm sure he would love this party. Uh, sure it's a party. We should bring everyone.

01:56:45

Yeah. So here's our story, we will say everyone is here, then i'm not pulling everyone out, sand, drew hired, all of us to make a trip. He's a very ambitious and boisterous guy. He hired us to make a trip when no one else would because he could make a killing getting across the crown of the world it winter.

01:57:04

And we are all exasperated by his overwhelming and un, uh, justified confidence in our abilities, and we almost died getting here. I mean, that does sound like Sandru. And a mako is um someone who happened to have been she used to live here. But is was hired as a local guide for us as the only one from minkai originally, besides OG but oh geez, a tegu and seen as a lowly bird person.

01:57:36

I think i got boobs like way over here or something. Oh, i have all selected an oak chaka way up here, but uh, yeah.

01:57:50

Because that cover our bases for story.

01:58:01

Okay, you don't have to say that. You're okay. You're the Empress, the bee princess but you can at least say that you're here on finding more out about your culture or something, i know less about hungle than i do about minkai so i don't know if i should be from here.

01:58:22

No, no. I meant from from minkai like she was our local guide hired for the caravan back in the inner C region to help us. Once we got here to mankai and Tian not necessarily hongal, ah i'm getting hold on.

01:58:48

You don't have to be if you don't babe well now.

01:59:00

Hey, she does pretty good at mimicking. The accent. Okay, i think i got it. Um, and considering i can cast this to twice a day. I'm gonna do it just in case they have any uh majors to him. Oh, find this out about the the what would be the single most easily identifiable mark but almond co is an autopsu.

01:59:28

Would it be the box or the sword both? Yes, let's take one quick second here to talk about. This is a really, really nice map. I like this map, it is very nice. Um, pretty mad. So well, would this help us with the hiding those you think? Because if i'm reading this correctly shoko could just pick up a rock misdirect, the sword and the box to two rocks and then throw the rocks.

02:00:00

Just in a river. It doesn't say like we have to have the second object on us or to read is that

02:00:11

I mean, that is true.

02:00:20

Um though maybe just a regular sword would be better for the the katana. Uh, just it's not as oh is it saying you have our team still failure? Again, you don't have it.

02:00:42

Or is it a spell? Like, and it's still like there. I've turned it off.

02:00:51

Section of course reason just takes his bow and just shubs it into the bag of holding that his face. That is also the other option. Yeah. Oh, she's gonna store the katana in the bag of holding and he's just gonna keep his poison sand tube at his dagger. Um, everything else is going to be away.

02:01:14

I think we should all. Maybe keep one something for self-defense. And then if they ask us to disarm, we can i guess disarm. I can just slide a pad in the water glassy, right? They are small. I thought about pulling out one of the old ones from the double walking stick katana for this.

02:01:34

But does this work with a bag of holding?

02:01:45

Yep. Yeah, i don't throw another. It's actually a great way to hide something. That's something's a bag of holding. I would imagine it's only a round for lettable though. That's the problem. We would have to cast it roughly before we uh if there are other guests coming to this party then we could see if like uh like where they get started to be checked out.

02:02:10

That is an arcane trickster spell, that they silent and still cast right before they get searched, because it's can't trip. But that's where other guests. I'm not sure how many of us to say would be unless there were inviting more. Yeah. Sorry. Oh, it is a good thing that i have.

02:02:40

There's a this one. Um, there it is.

02:02:51

Praise and perhaps it's best if everybody else appears on armed and you and i and maybe calda as guards show up with our actual weapons. And then that way if they ask us to disarm it doesn't look super suspicious when everybody's like oh we don't have any weapons. You know what i mean?

02:03:06

At least it looks like we disarmed a little bit so i'll have my katana. You can have your bow and kelda can have like her ax and shielded, then we can disarm for them if they ask for it. And everybody else can have slide of hand or sneaky things in their bags of holding if they have them and stuff like that.

02:03:21

Yeah, we can we just gonna be a fight right off the bat? I think we're gonna have, oh, no way. You know that there is a local superstition in hungle. A stranger does not wear a sword indoors as decoration. Yeah. Yeah, that's what i'm saying. We have something to disarm with when we get there like we wouldn't know, you know what i mean?

02:03:46

Most of us wouldn't know, okay, but if you want to get them, the impression that, you know, at least some basic grace, then you might want to preemptively adhere to some of superstitions since fine with putting his bow in the in his bag. Can i mean it's not like he doesn't have other weapons.

02:04:08

Yeah. All right, magical folding for all the stuff and keep it dagger. I am. I am keeping my wakazashi. You will have to fight me for those but i am probably concealable. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah. And my wave blade is a small weapon so i can conceal that. Right.

02:04:34

What's your slide of hands, sir? Uh, all right, chuckle will attempt to see hide his weapon and ask. If you guys could see it, is it in background skills. It is i have zero ranks and sleight of hand. So i won't be bringing a dagger in here. No, i rolled up three in the here's to not have a rock, is actually that, but

02:05:06

Oh, i never did my skill ranks.

02:05:12

If grayson with his perception can see through that, we will ask him. Oh, i can possibly see. Yeah. Okay.

02:05:27

Person is. Yeah. Yeah, she actually quickly like for once a density and is like, no offense. All right, we put it on the bag of holding. And if i notice anybody trying to search the search, it uh, i'll cough into my hand and try and could feel it with vessel.

02:05:53

Not a problem.

02:06:04

All right, i have taken a ridiculous number of ranks and and bluff. If there's ever a time for it to be useful. It's now, yeah. Sugar finally, time to show us your social skills. What were you guys's bonuses on slight of hand? I'm scared. Mine. Isn't that? Like, i don't think i should bring a weapon.

02:06:29

You don't have to say, but it did build.

02:06:37

Jesus and i get to do ninja stuff. Yay. That's true. All right, whatever. I'm rolling up to the door conference, all right?

02:06:56

Same here. Choco will stay at the back of the party though. Welcome. The golden one has been waiting. We are very excited to welcome you and sure will hurry you pass. Countless guards and groveling slaves to the palace's central courtyard. Can imagine real quick, i'm sorry. Can i make a sense motive to see just confirm that they're in it for the hot blonde foreign women that we've brought with us and not for a mako before i still haven't encountered the print.

02:07:30

So that little difficult this gentleman or person. I couldn't actually tell their little androgynous, but um, could i roll sense motive on them to see just royal advisor? Chew it. Uh, it is royal advisor, chewa. It's also the the guy who was hi heading the okay you know how hard it is to find appropriate Tiana artwork, i see.

02:07:55

Okay, that's fine. I just wanted to see if they were like looking at a makeup, a lot, you know what I mean? No, they barely pay her any attention at all. Perfect. Okay. Well that's good enough for me. Sorry, please continue your description that i really interrupted. No way being like wow rude.

02:08:14

Countless cards and groveling slaves. To the palace is central courtyard, a batch chamber, nearly a hundred yards across built around a steaming lake, organs grow, and gardens overlooking, the lake while colorful hair and swooped, through the air. All beneath a ceiling hidden by prayer, flags You find on a huge bed surrounded by colorful silks painted screens and beautiful white painted, women sits and then enormous smiling man dressed in volumous.
