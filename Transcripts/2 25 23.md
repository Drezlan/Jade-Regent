00:00

Horse riding shooting on a horse of wrestling. Lots of performing. Uh, we cooked for the guy and we ate scorpions.

00:15

Um,

00:19

Uh, after after we were done enjoying the local culture and the local cuisine, we went out on the last day of the big festival to watch a parade, and then the of the big dragon that was at the head of the parade, a bunch of ninjas popped out of it.

00:46

Yeah. And so we fought the ninjas, they nearly killed us because they had well, no they nearly killed Shoko because Shoko has five strength but they have a strength shadow. Essence is a very potent poison. Yes. Yes. Um and then a nice lady showed up and was like come with me if you want to live and we followed her and it turns out she's a keeps the knee too.

01:21

Um, and then sugar was very sad because he had to go pick up his sword that he was getting enchanted. That short it goes. Wife is, don't you just chanting that like in the game like just out of nowhere? Yes. I feel like that's very rude. What? And then next time you use commune with birds it will have been at like a low volume like a mumble the whole time, but when you just the volume will go up to the poking, battle level that we had in here.

01:57

Anyways uh and the lady told us we need to get the fuck out of order logenheim and we need to get our asses to the force the spirits, but to do. So in a way that doesn't go through the major paths because if they've simplified so ninjas off, it was already and we're already here they're probably going to be on the main roads into mentality.

02:18

So i think our conversation left off with, and how do you propose we get through the forest of spirits? I know the path. I'm going to lead you.

02:32

Um, do we have time to get everyone else in the caravan? Or are we splitting off here?

02:43

We should leave by sunrise, but you must hurry.

02:50

Uh yeah we've we've gotten the boys and we've gotten the boys to uh get things in gear, ready to go and less time than that before. All right, shrunk of collaps and immediately uh sets off in the direction of the caravan, to get Sandra to get everything together. Oh, she's gonna be walking around the whole time with his hand on his sword because of events.

03:16

Anywhere. So i know that olf and chaka were intending to leave. The caravan are they forced to come away from this whole thing or yeah a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. They're gonna be killed if they go back. Just the two of them and the other direction. And i think og will tell them that like, hey, uh, you might be in this one for the long haul.

03:45

I think it's much, much safer. If you guys come with us in, on our journey forward, because you'll be alone in a defenseless, I didn't think they'd be on your your asses. This close out of the crown, you're right. We'll stick with you and we'll take a ship back as soon as we can, we'll get you an escort back home.

04:07

But, you know, i don't want to see. I don't want to lose either of you over. What is our problem and not yours. We signed on to help you and your princess.

04:21

You all talk, very loudly around that campfire.

04:34

I mean, no, no. It's just kind of looking with a hand on a walk is out here. Like,

04:44

You got to remember? No, he gets a button thrown at her head like an actual pork button thrown at her head. I think if room i make oh, if we riff on that. Uh, you guys talk very loud around the campfire thing. Oh cheese. Like constantly trying to take himself, really seriously.

05:01

But i think at this point, if i estimate it correctly, he's like pretty freshly 18 years old and got that unlimited so CAT thing and he's always like, he's playing cards with like sandru or like helping koya cook or something. And anytime anybody else is drinking he's like, oh, be cool too.

05:18

And he does some and then he gets a little loose beaked. You know, you don't have the constitution to keep up with a 30 plus year old drinker in sandshrew. No. And there's a dwarf, exactly. So i don't think he gets like, super hammered like every night, but i think he definitely like overestimates.

05:37

It's tolerance. And like constantly gets a little. I mean, we are pcs. We are superhuman freaks. Yeah, but if he's gonna try and drink as much as the dwarf, no, i think he just gets caught up in the and the spirit of it. They're like the way that grace and kelda probably put it down pretty well and sandruz like always trying to have a good time.

06:01

Ochie tries to pick up a little bit and then like gets a little loud.

06:09

But fun. Oh yeah. He seems very none. Plus also i don't know why you got this bottom from food cards at the festival chow. Shuba.

06:33

Get it back full of that. And let's get this thing rounded up and you like puts his finger up and like, spins it in there like a lasso. Let's go. Let me goes in. Like i like how quickly we've managed to get no way from being like i gotta was just kill them and make them quiet to just oh but bum though button exactly.

06:51

Yeah, body system, everyone. No. Don't know. In these think these guys could be hiding anywhere. I think we probably have worked out like some shorthand commands with, like, the whole caravan at this point, too. Where like the, the layman's version of it is like gonna get murdered again packing up.

07:12

Let's go. It's like a code word or two, you know? Oh my god, the lightnings back. Oh my god. Oh hey, fang is back. You are truly blessed my friend. Okay. What have you, whatever? You've done. I don't know. What did you do to anger? Hey fang. Oh yeah, one more thing.

07:44

Why you no get is your min kaiyan. Not minimum passing grade. Uh, if that was thunder drums, right?

08:03

Uh yeah, it was a fun thunderous drums. Uh,

08:14

Interesting. Oh good says. All right, everyone, we need to lay low as he's getting repeatedly blasted with lightning animation.

08:30

Okay. And let me go to. Yes, delete that item please. Let me go to macros. Drunken animation, macros conclude token animations.

08:58

You better look, such sad. She'll go. All right, let's see if that works. I think i'll geothermic comment, too. Like sorry greyson we're we're gonna go to the land of no drinking a little sooner than we plant. Well, all right. Uh grayson and kelda have both been drinking less and you can tell that their nerves are a bit on edge and it just having a little bit of problems dealing with the sudden reduction.

09:42

Is anyone going to tell them? But it says no way between muffles about tell them what choco says completely fly-faced.

09:57

Here, i'm gonna roll not to laugh with my bluff, to hold it in and i rolled a 20 It's so good that he is just like almost like a stuffed bird. Just like nice staring flatly. No. Emotion whatsoever. It's almost yeah. It's like taxidermy. He just freezes. It doesn't move the.

10:27

They can't see if you don't move.

10:35

Or, uh, did you have time to get your sword shoko? Uh, yeah, it's, uh, not done, but the kind, uh, kind blacksmith did refund me. So at least there's that anonymous treats, man. I'm gonna be honest. I saw you guys were still on discord for like hours after the set.

11:02

The last session. It was like, hmm. I wonder if they're doing like a, she'll go and and no way sneak into the city and get the sword. Like when weighed out the enchantment, like avoid the, the guy who was coming to look at everything kind of mini. Uh, yeah.

11:25

Yeah, we might have been able to pull it off shades. The sand doesn't seem to think. We would have been able to though.

11:36

Uh, i think i think it's fine. We'll show cook again. His sword enchanted somewhere, uh, right now though and gavin are interested in getting this show on the road because i want to see what the force of spirits is like,

11:59

Boom. Well, the force, the spirits is still a bit of a ways off. Indeed. Uh, shoko would look to everyone say, we really this might get hectic. This might be depending on how fast the um the golden one learns that he had the alma tatsu psion in his clutches.

12:24

It just let her get away.

12:29

Um, a bitch. Um, Happened. Um, depending on how fast he can mobilize after learning that and how angry he is, this might be a repeat of what what it was, uh, on the later half of our trek through the boring expense and after the undead found us,

13:07

Um, so speaking about this forest of spares, what, what should be we aware of in there. Is it like the spirits are talking about fae or about? Um, something else. No, there are some of my kind there but it is home to the kami.

13:27

Truck. Go nods. Um i technically from there, i kind of have a way with words with the spirits of the lands. I might be able to get a sound of any sticky situations where you get into with, with the commie that is good because it is me. We're going to have to ask for passage through the woods.

13:54

Yeah, we're gonna do our please and thank you everyone and we're not gonna touch stuff. We're not going to touch anything. This is target or comment, different from yokai. One i consider, i don't think i'm using another term correctly.

14:17

Uh, i don't actually know what caught me are in the setting. Let me so their spiritually, they're benevolent for the most part spirits, they protect things that cannot protect themselves. So places of nature or sometimes even things that are civilized that have been abandoned, the spirits that protect the world that can protect itself and i don't know what you call yokai.

14:41

Are also kami but also ghosts and only it's very complicated. This place is a their birthplace. They've been here as long as the land has. This is also the place where the five storms were imprisoned until they escaped. I have no right knowing the stuff that i just said, but i definitely don't know that.

15:12

There's much of me wish to discuss with. You could i roll knowledge to justify that local local? No. Wouldn't it just be? Would it be religion? I'm pretty sure coming fall under flames. The they do have that bony are humanoids for the most part. Well, not almost them actually come to think about it.

15:38

Unfortunately, it's a case to case basis but these the various types of yoga night? Yeah. Yeah. It's where it's why? No, i looks like evidently kind of confused by the notion of what do you mean they came out of

15:54

Most very different to what i know about the owning the forest of spirits. Is birthplace to all yokai? She seems very certain of this. Like, it is known.

16:11

Does this count as supernatural?

16:16

Uh, i would say, yes, actually So better than 22. You are welcome to know about most common uh kami at least shikigami or the the largest amounts, they protect things, such as rocks and boundary markers uh you know all the stuff you were just talking about. I don't really need to repeat it back to you.

16:42

Yeah.

16:48

So, choco would make sure to tell everybody not to go to the bathroom in any rivers, half hour type of coming, right? Yes. Okay. Also, a type of owning you, you don't want, you don't want what they'll do to you. So we know, i just want to clarify out of character.

17:10

We're going through the forest to not along this southern path. We will go along the path for a ways. And then we will turn inward or we can try it and navigate straight through it. If you were a friend to the cummies, we should be able to do it relatively um yeah, yeah, friend might be stretching it but uh we i can, i can do my best.

17:38

Our group is a fairly reverent lot. I think we will be okay. I don't think i have to worry too much. Oh, we have a particularly interesting comment along with those anyways. So maybe our rapport will give her something in that regard. Can it come out? No. Yeah, no.

18:02

I doesn't know this for sure but she'll say no. Anyway, yeah yes. Logic would say the box is a. Yes. Let me go. Yes, says omiko. Okay, it was possessing me when we first threw approaching brainwall. That's true. It did not like being out of the seal, but it can be, it can do that.

18:26

Tommy do not usually possess people, it's against their nature, but it was desperate and trapped away from its charge. I'm glad that it did is that box now asking for a friend,

18:46

Who is carrying that box? I would think i might go. No, i think we should not do that. I think we should not put all of our eggs in the army, one basket. Yeah, she's already got the she's already. Someone else should hold the, the seal. Okay. Um, i don't know about with the whoever.

19:09

Well it's the end of anything happens to me. The seal, can name a new air to minkai? It is very important that it does not stay with me. It's i die. It's the only thing that can grants authority. It's like leaving your title in your car. You really kind of shouldn't do it.

19:26

Then the seal should go to whoever in case something goes wrong tactically, i would say great actually looks at no way. Uh, she could escape quickly if they need arised and she would brutally murder anyone that tried to stop her from escaping with the seal. You can take that as an imperial order.

19:49

If you need to, she's not from here, she's not a citizen a muka

20:06

Very reluctantly holds our hands with with like the most restraint you've ever seen. Like removes it from the walk of satchi handle and just pulls out. Like, i know and i know i'm telling you that if i die, you need to make the importance of people that you've never met the important matter.

20:31

But that's how i'm always going to rule.

20:43

Fine, fine. Just for reference, it can be like a belt pouch thing. I would say if you have a larger biggest, it is also inside of a puzzle box. So it's oh yeah, don't remember a puzzle box. The warning box itself, is a puzzle block. Is it can hold something that's eight by eight by three.

21:10

So it's like a like a piccolo case or a flute case. Pretty like could go on a belt? Yeah. It's it's it's actually no bigger than like noise on like smoking pipe locks on. Yeah and then that notion actually he probably would just replace it just the thing just over shoulder wildly somewhere.

21:36

Just fine.

21:43

I have a lot of jokes i could make, but a lot of them hinge on the idea of omeco dying and i don't like that. So i'm gonna hold them in.

21:58

Let's get everyone all set up for the night and get ourselves on the way in the morning. Now, if we are dead set on traveling through the forest, there is something that you need to know traveling off of the roads and away from any awards and talismans will likely increase the chances of a spirit.

22:20

Finding their way into you i beg your pardon the forest of spirits. They wonder there. Didn't we just establish that? It's against the commy's nature to possess people. There are other spirits here. It's not the forest of kami. No, that it is to that too.

22:49

Oh, well, we should be ready for anything. These are hardly ordinary times after all.

22:59

I mean, when is anything ever ordinary for the for us?

23:08

Struggle pauses. Tries to think. Yeah, i've got nothing. You're you're absolutely right. Grayson. We used to kill goblins.

23:22

Yeah. Well, we used to kill options.

23:37

So once we take you, you guys can keep talking. I'm gonna that's the wrong one. I forgot that was here. This is what we were actually doing that night. We get shunted into another world suddenly it's akai adventure. Wait, no, because i've been to the year 3000. Oh god about to snow.

24:00

No please. No. Here we go. I don't need. No. My girlfriend's mom used to work for disney, so she like, really grew up on a lot of those like mid two, thousands disney channel things. And like she was really into the jonas brothers and i had to suffer through like a lot of jonas Brothers stuff.

24:19

I watched Camp Rock for the first time the other day. Oh my. That was rough. It was really, really, i mean up that song is by was by busted. Yes. I yeah, yeah. Not. Now, i just saw that on tick tock for the first time the other day. I didn't realize it was not a joke for other song but i only know.

24:41

The job's brother's version. Very solidly. Uh, uk. I don't need that. Why do you know that i've never want to remember.

24:53

So it's about 500 miles to get to the edge of the beard forest.

25:05

Okay, so shoko i need you to switch your drums to midi and start playing. F zero soundtracks and choir. We'll use her caravan thing and we will do this in three days. How does big blue go? Again, i'm gonna go look it up, eight, two.

25:29

I'm sorry, i do not have a regular encounter list for this place. So video.

25:48

A narrow dirt path, disappears into the dark edge of the forest ahead, the bowels of the trees, hang heavy with fallen snow and an almost prednatural silence reigns over the area peeking through the snow of the trees, though are pink blossoms. Should do we have music for this other than festival?

26:11

Music. Only festival music all the way for more dragon. I mean, it's supposed to be a kind of delightful looking scene, ah, and they supposed to blooming this season. We'll go here ahead a small stone, pillar engraved with strange. Symbols has fallen across the past, blocking the way forward.

26:51

No way. Show go. Great thing. Oh, gee big map.

27:11

Uh, so about this about this weather slash clock thing in the corner here. Is that, is that accurate right now? Like says the 24th of the third month.

27:31

I can't move that anymore. It's there way too, uh, it should be accurate. We're not having rain today, though. I could barely select a little thing to open the weather because it's, yeah, i can't move it. And it's like, right, i think it's a resolution size thing because mine stuck behind the drop down menu.

27:54

Also if you remember the drop down menu though you can do that. You just have to remember to hold shift at the very corner of the you can click and drag but uh, you can also turn that off in the configuration settings. And scroll down the simple calendar and turn off the the opening compact view.

28:36

Uh, so i am in darkness. Uh, it's quite scary.

28:47

Oh no, i don't know. Whatever shall we do? How about now? Now we are on a great grid. We are on the we are in the street fighter training, still just have to reload. You gave us full vision though, when you did that? Yep. Okay, but it was very clear, it just means you have to reload.

29:09

I'm sorry, i don't want to be labor. This but kid, which one can you move the drop down menu or the calendar? Because it's behind my you can move the drop down menu, right? With shift check, click clicking on the arrow, or oh, this little yellow thing. I just click on like one of the swears.

29:28

Yeah, i grab it anywhere. I move it. I did everything except for regular. Click it.

29:44

Oh, where's myory? Oh my god, this APS so many npcs that are hanging out all the time.

29:56

Where she? There she is.

30:02

It's everyone. Remember yuck.

30:13

What?

30:23

The name sounds vaguely familiar. So i think it's been a long time. Could you repeat it? Oh, it did tuck at h u k. He was the the one that wrestled. Yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. Um, yes, i do. Remember her, uh,

31:05

Ah, since most of you are new to our lens, these way markers. Oh my god. The lightning's back lightning. Not not for us. Just just for you. You know what? That's fine. This, i accept. This is now officially a new problem. You did this?

31:35

All right, all right. I'll try and fix it myself. Yeah. So she actually like runs out into the clearing. Looks at the the way marker. Looks back at you guys. She seems completely unafraid what this area. We're about to wakanda army. I've never missing either of those movies. I don't know what that means.

32:01

Way. Markers like these, follow up to her. They are usually watched over by shikigami.

32:14

Who is saying this is this I'll make old that's saying this. No. It's um your wife miro. Oh, i don't see her on the map, man, you're totally large something. Has some like serious vision problems. Yeah. How old are you again shoko? Right here. I'm reloading and probably for that.

33:08

So, anoint yourself and the chronic. Somewhere around here. There could be we should write the right the way marker and leave an offering.

33:36

Oh, what tends to be a good offering? Mmm food. Mmm. Sometimes a bit of coin, some small thing to help them in their, their charge and their journey and protecting these things. So they want us to fix the markers and then they want us to pay them a tip, that's a present.

34:01

She browns at you uh, you'll have to excuse us. We're a little plus after being chased across the entirety of northern hungle. Okay. Understand this. But the coming must not take mortal forms. They can be killed. When they do, they guard over the spirits of these objects. It is our purpose in place to guide them physically.

34:35

We live in concurrence with one another in harmony.

34:45

All right. Okay, come along i'll show you how to how we what the sense to look like and show go well. Uh start setting up the, the whole traditional uh, you know, like well, how Japanese people like tend to pray it, like shrines means over your shoulder to watch.

35:17

Uh, so did you want me to roll a religion to see if i embarrassed myself? Yeah, go ahead.

35:28

I mean, you're also you know, a dirge bard. So whoa, that was close. She'll go.

35:39

Uh, shoko is very conscious of the very attractive. Ladies breath on the back of his neck and all like banning fanning herself as she watches you and then like whispers in your ear that doesn't go there. Oh okay. Um all right. And then she giggles it goes over and starts trying to push the way.

36:04

Marker up grace, it comes up next to ochi watches, the two of them and it just looks up at Ochi and it just kind of nods with a smirk on his face.

36:28

Uh, all right, so what do we have for, for tribute for these fine shikami?

36:46

I mean, we have our rations. No, that was supposed to be from coyote. Yeah, exactly not. I mean, she's helping with the the way marker up.

37:15

Uh, oh, it's lost some of those. Oh, i know. Those are a few days old at this point. Um,

37:27

Uh, what's on? What's a proper tribute and coin? Because, uh, i don't have much in the way of like miscellaneous junk. On my character sheet, a silver tube would be fine. All right. Uh, if there are, there are two ways runs. Yeah, so she'll go leave two silver in each.

37:48

Oh, she will also

37:56

All right. After you push the way marker up and then set two coins on it, uh, memory collapse, your hands together and whispers a small prayer and seeing and the way markers starts glowing. And you all feel a deep sense of satisfaction.

38:24

Long page. That's why.

38:30

Between two.

38:39

And out from the the stone, a very wisened two foot tall. Very thin young man in billowitz, homespun robes that are more wearing him than he's wearing them, uh, kind of appears if ephemeral. He bows you his hands claps together and held above his head. Uh and he says in tian you are very gracious guests, you are welcome to pass into the spirit forest.

39:24

And the sense of gratification that he leaves with, you gives you all a plus. One luck bonus on all saving throws for the next week.

39:34

Hell yeah. Struggle puts the sands together and returns the bow. Oh, gee does the same. I must warn you though that these before it is. Dangerous, angry spirits have become quite active. We fear the work of the storms.

40:03

You must be cautious. Broker will not thank you for your warning and your words of wisdom. We will do our best to tread lately. And with respect i will tell no borrow to get you are coming the kami wish to speak with you.

40:30

You may rest by my way shine, you will be safe. Here, i will protect you from the wandering spirits.

40:43

We thank you for your hospitality.

40:48

I thank you for your compassion, the spirit of the old man just kind of bowels and fades away.

41:02

Correct question mark. Yeah, i'll make of the actually looks pretty and awe from this whole thing.

41:23

And performs are very traditional eastern vowel to the the way stone.

41:37

Good chocolate. Some flowers next time, shall i?

41:43

There's another narrowed i gaze cast your way.

41:52

They might appreciate them. A treat from afar. Some of the kami are quite partial to sweets. I don't know if you showed me but i was complaining to him about him, pee on me and then he started being sad. Show go nod to see cycles through his two forms trying to get rid of the stupid fucking lightning effect.

42:15

Still on you. It's very much. So still on me. It must be in your cash then because we don't see it. Yeah, maybe empty. Empty out your cash.

42:36

That can actually have a quite a profound effect on the forge. I have learned.

43:32

None of that helpful to me right now.

43:55

Boom. Play again is like, nudges you to followers with the rest of the group mayori. You are quite proficient at these rituals themes, you were not forgotten of all the things you learned in your homeland. Perhaps the comedy will get lets you pass. Oh, this is to me uh stroco uh, That would certainly be well quite the feather in my cap as they'd say, oh out west.

44:40

What's an interesting thing, unless they have camp. They have so many weird ones. You don't even god and as she walks around and heads to help set up camp. She flicks you with her tail as she goes. Shokos daughters and goes about his business. Trying to tried to ignore that.

45:05

Mmm, he does not successfully ignore it. Mad giggling from amigo. Not to be the negative non-seared a lot here. But what exactly happens when we aren't given permission to go through the forest?

45:30

My area looks over at you if some call or reason that makes you think you would not be granted entrance.

45:49

No way. Assuredly. Does not answer that question. Well.

46:01

Call me. I don't think any, i don't think any spirits acting under their own

46:10

Under their own direction would stop us unless they were permanent to a rage by what's the regent and his men have been doing here and like, i don't, is there any possible way that he could have bent some of them to his well with some magic of his, some of the coming?

46:43

I do not think so. Not here in the forest. The only do not return here. After they escaped, none have returned.

46:59

But i do not know if there are any comedy that have come here from elsewhere. I do not hold their secrets. I deleted not just my cash but everything reloaded still lightning. So, going back in, uh, maybe disable animations for yourself here. Maybe if i just turn off. Animations.

47:29

It'll clear out everything.

47:35

And then i will turn them back on at the moment. Automated animation. It's launch menu settings.

48:05

Did you turn it off shy? Reload.

48:14

Back to main menu. Oh,

48:22

Yeah, golden reload.

49:14

Okay, sorry, where was i? Priority. Yes. Is there some reason to call me would not grant you access. Why are you afraid of this? Ah, just we've add opposition every step of the way up until now is your cause not righteous.

49:44

Do you not move with goodness?

49:51

Show. Go final drops. The nervous. Affactation. It is, i truly believe that. I know that we are going. We're on our way to minkai to do our best for the people there and i hope i can only hope that the commie here can see that.

50:23

And you.

50:33

She's looking at no way.

50:41

Do you fear what you bring to this place?

50:51

Pointedly vanishes.

50:59

Okay. Um well, fuck how is it back for me? I have animations turned off. Yeah. Yeah, it's back. It's it's there for me and everyone else, see it too. Now, uh, no. So it's just me and sans for some reason. I can see it, okay. That's not for me.

51:30

So there's this is no weird going on.

51:51

Have to turn on the debug controls.

51:56

Look at that, folks.

52:01

So she takes a step back and draws her kukri.

52:10

She's known you guys for less than a day. Uh oh um, oh forgot. No way. Come on.

52:27

Yeah, that's a very cut that fucker away. I just now he goes past her and just invisibly climbs up a tree and just sits.

52:48

Your training ninjutsu? No.

53:00

She kind of like schools herself and reshes her kukri.

53:17

Shoko. Gives her like an apologetic. Shrug.

53:25

There are a few here left who are not ninja of the five storms.

53:39

Apologies.

53:46

No. Friends taking love it says no way from the tree because for what it's worth that's probably the sensible thing today. Not to me, of course.

54:04

Not anymore. Anyway.

54:15

Will we be mostly safe from the ninja of the five storms? If we able to the deeper parts of the forest, i believe. So yes, they do not venture near the pagoda.

54:35

And now you are definitely okay getting here. What is up? Yeah, even i can see it now. I just reloaded. Oh let's see. What is yep. It's it's back your setting. All i'm turning on debug mode. At this point, get the fucking ceo of foundry on the phone. This isn't a foundry thing, unfortunately.

55:07

Is the actual module points. Doing some and he will debugging.

55:21

Exchange news.

55:52

I see you took the spell off of my sheet here. Let me, yeah, i am trying to figure out what it did to your sheet.

56:35

Maybe if i add the fell back in,

56:50

Module settings, navigate to sequencer.

56:59

I looked up a help guide from automated animations. Oh yeah, i have never encountered this before.

57:19

Open database. You are so just because i'm trying to understand like exactly what happened. Did you make a an effect? The basically had an aura on you. Yeah, basically, okay.

57:38

Okay. I should have all the tools i need in my sidebar now to disable global animations.

57:51

But on a different note, i just had to learn something new so thank you for that. Uh, you're welcome. I always enjoy learning new stuff.

58:09

Wonder if there's something still in and the actor embedded document section. Then that's firing that off. It's quite possible. They told me i had to use the sequence or module, which is a required module for automated animations to work to just stop the sequence wherever it was,

58:34

Uh, should i reload? Uh, there should be a global reload already. I'm still getting zapped.

58:48

They can try like the the aura clip. What was that? Oh it moved. That's because i have a tool layer now where i can just grab it and destroy it. Yes, interesting. There was one on, ochie2, not playing right now. Not the same animation. It was this. It was your an animation loves over from your challenge?

59:14

Yeah, that's interesting. Um, all right, figured out how to get to that sequencer before. But was looking for it right now and could not find the menu that i saw for like the active ones anymore. Oh, i don't know if you will ever have access to sequencer. Remove all effects.

59:36

I'm gonna put it to trusted players and above and trust the players and above. All right. Everyone now should have access to some of the sequencer powers, especially for stopping things. It will reset one more time and then we shall carry on.

01:00:06

Yay. Charles vanquished right? Oh lightning. Yeah, indeed. Faux vanquist.

01:01:21

Because that don't need, you know, more.

01:01:32

Demo world data, you can do it.

01:01:50

Yes. Be very careful when making aura powers, always double check that it says on token.

01:02:01

He's always inspired, is

01:02:11

Anyone else still on downloading world data? Yeah, it takes a while. I just got back in.

01:02:23

Okay. Music back on cold tables.

01:02:56

Anyone wants to know, she'll be up a tree. It everyone back in. I'm in you just can't not see this map, no matter the color version of it and not get on that tree, branch. Can you? It's, it's a, it's a real nice tree wrench. It is? No, it knows like amma.

01:03:19

I'm gonna take a nap, anyone. Anyone wants to,

01:03:34

Nope, you guys make camp for the evening. Uh do we want to do any preparation?

01:03:45

Uh it's not necessarily any preparations but as we're finished up setting up campus such uh Grayson comes over to to ochi and it's like well, um you can you can stop using that uh that that string to hold your pants up. Now, here's your belt. It's finally finished. Oh yeah, i reinforced it with some of that frost tricks in you.

01:04:06

So it's should keep up with your, your speed, incredible. Thank you. It's very, very fine. Work a greatly. Appreciate it. Well, don't mention it just put it's a good use.

01:05:06

Hearing me, thanks. I needed that to hit back and pretty badly.

01:05:23

Um as far as preparations goes, i thought about like trying to lay some traps but if any ninja come after us that's it's just a waste of my time. Okay, pretty terrible ninja. All things considered. Oh, she isn't any kind of trap maker either so

01:05:49

Um, so mean.

01:05:55

Preparations for camping for the night or preparations for going. We're going into the the forest.

01:06:11

I guess shoko would go over like just proper etiquette with everyone and make sure they know how to how to bow, how to say their peas and qs all that. Oh because my doctor be really important and please don't start screaming at any of them, out of nowhere. But those battle, some of you have a bit of a had strong streak.

01:06:41

Uh, we should try and

01:06:51

Violence should be our last resort. Here, we don't want to make the whole force pissed at us.

01:07:00

Wouldn't want to add something else to the long list of things that inevitably are going to be in our past. Try to kill us, right? Chose another from like you know leaning of her tree. Come on along. Lift me or do you want to hear it?

01:07:23

Um, yes, actually

01:07:28

Well, let's see.

01:07:33

Well, you got the five storms obviously, you got them into bitter end of the employer and five stars. You've got the just happened to be in our part of the one who's dead for their own prerogative. I mean, there was the ghost spirit that was haunting. I was basically across the entirety of the world and then the dragon, the attack does then there's all of the Yoko Oni that were also in the path and everything.

01:08:05

I'm forgetting exactly what though because it tends to just see everything. Oh, giant spiders. That that wasn't, um,

01:08:24

I see and out of all of them, i don't think i've ever been as scared of them as i am of you, when you're angry, no way.

01:08:39

What's your racy?

01:08:44

Uh, well, my shield's probably down right now. So it'll be a. It'd be 20 unless we're going, oh yeah, unless we're going flat footage, in which case it would be 17. Okay, so luckily you're out of shurikan range. In fact, no, i don't think you are.

01:09:11

I don't think she'll not twenty of this. Probably be fun.

01:09:31

Yeah, it's probably and a notch. One of this. Probably be fine. There's like and or something.

01:09:44

Yep, that one. So you you see this shuriken fly out from the tree and it's well in your general vicinity certainly didn't hit you.

01:10:04

Oh oh, she would never actually heard us. It's fine. And then you look at what which you're gonna is and you realize it's one of the two that has death blade poison on it. Yep.

01:10:22

Don't go is for the second time glad that you can't see his skin change color under his fur today. Uh, and says, yeah, and continues the, uh, rolling a deception. Check to me. Arrow. Uh, she wouldn't hurt us, it's fine.

01:11:03

Huh.

01:11:12

Very well this way. Then i suppose. Yes. Let's um, but set up camp for the night.

01:11:25

Oh, this is the next day. Oh, this is the next day. Oh, i thought we were rolling out the campfire. Oh, because i was chuckle, was actually going to approach miaro like at night and like uh, sorry do i waited. I thought there was going to be seven that i started advancing time and so now we're fine.

01:11:47

Keep going. Um,

01:11:52

So if it's not forward of me, i would like to know a little more about our guide.

01:12:09

Would you? Yeah, where Exactly. Are you miro? How did you find us?

01:12:31

That is a long tailed but to begin. I was born in northern Minkai. I was daughter to abandon chief.

01:12:47

He came to the southern fringes of the forest of spirits while trying to escape imperial troops. And while they fought bravely in the grove of ancient trees, the troops still caught up to them. All of the bandits though, we're already slain.

01:13:09

Bearing, the spirits of the haunted forest, the mean guyans quickly returned to their home.

01:13:20

The commie told my mother, they had killed my father because he desecrated one of their most sacred groves.

01:13:31

It was up to my mother and me to make amends from my father's dishonor.

01:13:40

So, my mother doing what any sensible woman would do gave me to them.

01:13:57

Choco blinks and cocks his head as he tries to process that.

01:14:08

Afterwards, my mother committed suicide, feeling the packs with her like blood, and they grew up in the force of spirits, a child of the coming, but not one of them.

01:14:22

And now i go with, they ask me to and help them.

01:14:30

Don't go closes his eyes and hangs his head and there are the coming. Call them ripples in the world that they can read.

01:14:48

They knew that the amateur family was still alive and that they were coming. When people move through the world, they leave awake in their passing the comic and read these wakes.

01:15:15

And the call me, they call me wish to see the region. Disposed. I assume the gummy wish to see the only removed from power once more. Many of them feel they have failed in their duty.

01:15:44

Okay. Okay. Yeah, i guess that makes sense. Uh, i was wondering if she was if she was implying of the only of the five storms work under the jade region, right? No, he is a puppet. Oh, And then she kind of looks off. Looks at the sunset and just sort of starts dancing away.

01:16:12

Flicking her tail as she goes.

01:16:19

Um, sunset, and excuse me.

01:16:34

Struggle will follow.

01:16:39

If should I do is is it like obvious that she's like ending the conversation and like walking away or no? It actually just seems like she was struck by the urge to dance. And so she started dancing with the sunset.

01:17:02

Now, that you're actually talking to her and stuff. Her mannerisms are much more like a spirit than a kitsune.

01:17:12

She stops in the middle of her dance to water at the ground. Uh, and not like a normal person. She doesn't like crouch down to examine the ground. She bends at the hips to look at the pine needles on the ground. The smell of flower.

01:17:34

You've really spent your whole life here. Haven't you? They come in where my family? They raised me from a babe.

01:17:55

Go, go closes his eyes.

01:18:02

I don't have the words. Are there others? Like you or are you an only child so to speak? I am not the only one loved by the coming if that's what you mean.

01:18:23

Um, asking if you've been aside from the spirits, if you've been alone here, there are some few other kids who name in the forest of spirits, but i did not live with them.

01:18:46

Does this does that life make you happy first? What is the point of not being happy with life?

01:19:03

They will not make it better. Well, no. But the second part of not being happy with life is binding, the will to make it better yourself. Yes. There's much easier to summon. That will though, when you were always happy with life or at least content being happy all the time is very exhausting.

01:19:31

Uh i certainly wouldn't know anything about that but you have so many friends you have the grumpy one that has no respect. You have the princess just like a bar winch.

01:19:52

An old woman that sees the stars, a young samurai on a strong road.

01:20:03

And the most peculiar stone folk i've ever seen. Don't stone. Oh, is that the mankind word for dwarf? Or does minaro literally think grace and is a rock, man. Yes, could be either. She may just not know the common word for dwarf.

01:20:33

Oh, i thought she was referring to me when she said the uh, the grumpy one with no respect other possible.

01:20:48

Well, i hope having you with us can makes your family more accommodating of us as on our journey through. I have no reason not to vouch for you as of now. But this can always change. The kami will test you in the end. It is them. You must impress, my words will only take you so far and she picks up a flower.

01:21:19

That's fallen from a tree. He's specifically. Picks up a flower. Not plex one.

01:21:30

Puts it and show goes here and runs back to the group.

01:21:40

Circle will also return.

01:21:48

Watch now has the wildest turn from the mating ritual. There's nowhere sideways from loudly enough that we can hear cocoa costs, loudly and tries to look away before retreating behind a rock.

01:22:20

Corner.

01:22:31

Oh crap. I need to open, sorry, and the advanced and giant templates sentences that make me very concerned.

01:22:52

Now it is opening the whole compendium a moment.

01:23:07

And i want to play some bat on how long it takes before i figure out how to really piss officana.

01:23:17

I'd rather place a bet to see if it's uh which one of us pisses off a comedy first. Oh, god is why we're friends racing?

01:23:41

I'm tails to seminaro have by the way. This one.

01:23:49

Between she is likely never been trained by another kitsune.

01:23:59

What the hell?

01:24:06

Uh, yeah, i don't think i've mentioned this since when he first transformed. But uh do you guys know how many tail? Struggle has. I don't actually, uh, narco is a four-tailed fox.

01:24:24

Too many quite bad, too. Many.

01:24:33

One. Whoa, a little racer. Hi. Have we met my cat? But no way the the raging racist. I was not the first thing that came to mind. Honestly no more like the, the person who's easily able to find something that just get up easily classifies people. And also is like

01:25:06

There it is. Okay. Do no. No Pathfinder KitchenAids. Do not work on you're they're not like 400 years old right? Not not quite like that. No yeah, maybe 300 yourself. Thank you representation of spiritual power or something. Yes. No, i probably just assumes. You actually have one tail and they'll just bunch together.

01:25:50

You know, the pokemon of vulpix growing up. I always thought Vulpix had like just one big bushy tail. I didn't realize they were a bunch of different tails design, definitely lends itself to being like oh that's just like one one big poofy tale, right.

01:26:40

So that comes charging out.

01:26:49

Of the forest. Oh yeah. That's that's um, that is a huge sized white tiger. All right. The biako fight starts now.

01:27:25

Taking the tigers simply appears out of the forest rushing towards you roaring loudly at your caravan. What happened to that whole like, oh wait, no, we'll be protected. So it's becoming well. What is this thing? Can we get a knowledge? Is it planes role? You said, because call me is this.

01:27:53

I don't think it was a commie. Yeah, that's true. That's true. I said it was a very large dagger tiger.

01:28:03

On the other hand the roar does seem to almost sound like half formed words, uh notes nature or since motive please.

01:28:19

Uh oh there is the knowledge. The planes version, two as well, knowledge planes, there's the knowledge plane too.

01:28:31

Oh my god. You bastards. I rolled a 19 and then grayson's die rolled into it and knocked it onto a one. That's beautiful. You must.

01:28:49

Very funny actually. Uh okay. So it was a DC, 20 for the knowledge nature in the sense motive. Boo, boo. So grayson just grayson. Huh. Grayson, you are for some reason, very familiar with the behavior of tigers and it's back to very abnormally. I i have no idea how i would be familiar.

01:29:19

Okay. Random light reading. You picked up back at the golden one. That's just like, oh this seems like an interesting book, i think so. But if you you get the impression that this is very different for this tiger, it's a lone solitary predator. The usually attack from ambush, they don't usually attack large groups like this uh ochi you got over a 20 on your knowledge, the planes check.

01:29:48

And, you know, that such tigers are sacred to the commie of the forest of spirits, put away your weapons. This is a sacred beast. Uh yeah, i agree that something's not right with this uh even cats is bigger than that, don't charge this huge group of people and caravans.

01:30:08

Yeah, if they wanted to kill one of us, it would have dragged one of us off when no one was looking.

01:30:21

All right. So myory just stays very still, i'll make out does not draw her katana and weights, uh, personal just he won't raise his bow and i think he's just gonna pass his turn until we do that, no way. Drops out of the career and pulls her arm. All right rabbit.

01:30:55

What the fuck is the wrong with this thing? This is what i tell you. That's launchy have to speak with animals. Yes, they do.

01:31:18

If you oh god, youtube has macona's voice.

01:31:30

Boom. God. Everyone was so fast except for okay. To be fair. Oh, she is a bird. This is a cat. Oh no, the ancestral protection. Exactly. Just like wait, no, it is sacred but it is a cat and your snack size. It's been a long time since this huge tiger had a bird snack.

01:32:04

Since you know, it has to hunt fucking giant eagles and shit bubble. Boom. Uh, so yes. You two. Casts. Speak with animals. It's not even casted. Just you do is quite capable of every time. They talk. It's understood by animals and creature. Everything. And i was just like, you can talk fucking creatures, right?

01:32:30

Go and ask it. And if you get eaten more, i'll apologize to Tokyo. I guess it looks as a tiger. What's going on? The tiger roars is back. I see becomes a tattoo again.

01:32:51

I don't need both arms to like surf the amateures, right.

01:33:01

I mean no no it's not gonna understand. She has a heart like her other arm firmly on the hand of her workers actually. And it's like,

01:33:12

You get it. You get the impression that the tiger is not going to attack. It's testing you.

01:33:24

For fucking what?

01:33:29

But yeah. Wait, i hate the comic.

01:33:44

Broco will hold his hands up and attempt to call out in sons are the language of the kami.

01:33:58

Just chuckle. Yes, we are not here to fight you. We merely wish to pass peacefully.

01:34:21

And like that's uh, he'll end his turn, unless you're call. You'll ask for her situation. Check. Uh, i'm not because yucking is not akami. Okay.

01:34:41

The tiger charges full force right at you? Nope.

01:34:57

Stop short.

01:35:21

It's the tiger examines you.

01:35:26

With a great amount of reluctance. Snowy time does eventually on curl from her the handle of a rocketishi. It's like if you're gonna eat meat, can you make it fast?

01:35:45

Uh, so it's not really any way for you guys to know this outright. So i'm gonna just give you this little bit. So checking like a normal diet. Tiger is not starting out as hostile layers. Starting out as unfriendly, you'll have three rounds. Basically, to attempt to improve the tigers attitude with wild empathy or magic or skills of any kind of handle animal maybe.

01:36:16

And if you successfully get yaking to at least indifference the tiger will depart as suddenly as it arrived.

01:36:39

Very big kitty. So it's leaving. Nope, not yet. Not yet. It seems to just be growling and staring currently at no waves. Suspiciously.

01:36:58

Uh, is the tiger maybe hurt at all?

01:37:06

Um oh g will take a couple steps up here and try and get its attention to make guns? I contact and then bow to it.

01:37:22

Give me a handle animal.

01:37:47

And it's like, it's like a 20 degree at the waist, you know what i mean? Gives them a little polite. So, Let me see the DC, um, wild empathy to actually improve that. It's yeah, yeah.

01:38:11

It's the real problem for a group without a druid. Yeah, i was someone has charm monster. No, i was really just trying to show it that we're not afraid of it. And we're also not gonna attack it. Yeah. So i think because this is a very specific scenario literally designed around being friendly to those creature.

01:38:29

I'm gonna have it worked this time. That is not enough though. Didn't think it would be.

01:38:38

So, i will let you guys actually.

01:38:45

Okay, go ahead and give me that diplomacy check. You were trying to make earlier.

01:39:02

So the tiger kind of spends a little bit of time sniffing. No way. Looks at shoco. Another really understand his words but kind of gets the impressions.

01:39:25

Soco lays on his back and exposes his belly. Do i look like a dog? You have passed him the greatest insult. You can ever give to a feline. Oh, uh, but yes, with that role, he just basically spends around, trying appearing medicine. Let's not say trying because it's a fucking huge tire tiger.

01:39:52

It is menacing.

01:39:59

It is taking a lot for nowhere, not to want to stab that thing. I know, that's why he's looking at you. Uh and then, unless the one stops him turns and runs back into the divorce,

01:40:20

Um, honestly surprised that worked. Do uh, indeed. All my readings into tires and tires. Never give any indication that such a thing. Whatever successfully, uh, work on them. Okay. So here i said, what the hell, what, since what are you? An expert in tigers.

01:40:46

Um, i mean, did your parents. There's a lot of downtime while we're at that, palace back there.

01:40:57

Uh, he just read about tigers while you were in and, you know, the, the rules of the universe, only let me craft for eight hours a day and not anymore. Got a fill the void with breathing. So yeah, here's the thing about this tiger. If you make them, if you fail to improve the tiger's attitude or you do nothing or attack, the tiger kayaking immediately becomes hostile and attacks the pcs, the fighter, the tiger fights until killed and event that has unforeseen consequences, which i will now tell you about since they're not going to happen development.

01:41:38

If the pcs killed Tia King proceed to the consequences of hazy. Actions, the consequences of he's the actions is the person who lands the killing blow immediately getting possessed by a spirit of a hunter who used to kill tigers in his mortal life, and is now. So, filled with regret over it that he can't pass on and gives an ongoing effect of minus two penalty on initiative.

01:42:03

Checks to the person he is hunting slash possessing. Uh, and once you remove the possession, there is still a chance that, uh, the minus to penalty to initiative becomes permanent. As you permanently regret, your actions in killing a creature.

01:42:31

It's actually one of the more gnarly spirit events in the forest. That's wow. Okay. A permanent non-magical debuff. Uh-huh. There's actually no way to get rid of. That is there. Nope, sort of like maybe modifying someone's memories, like, it's not even a curse effect. It is a permanent untyped minus, one penalty on initiative checks.

01:42:59

This is what we call plot debuff to the opposite plot armor. It's also a taste of what the spirit encounters in the forest of spirits. They're going to be like is the forest of spirits, the majority of book four. Yes. Oh wow. Okay. The book is called forest of spirits.

01:43:25

Yeah. Oh, it's it's not a like oh, we're just gonna fly by here and be in mankind. No, no, no. There's stuff that must happened. Uh, yes. And i have many, many spirits in here and i made you them in any order. I please. So, i don't have a normal encounter track for this forest.

01:43:53

Like, that's, that's not how this one is being run. All right. It's kind of fun. I like it. Sure. We don't want to turn around to take a boat.

01:44:07

You really want to be on the open water when the five storms catch up with you.

01:44:17

Yeah. That's choco size. I guess i've just got to accept that. It's gonna keep getting harder as we get closer. So the tigers gone that yep? Dragon gun. Cool, cool. No, i just outright friends.

01:44:40

Just cool, cool.

01:44:46

That was some really big kitty. It could have bit you would have shoko. Exactly, baby. Now, with stomached onto the flowers and just size and closes his eyes.

01:45:05

I'm just gonna excellent. Uh-huh. You grabbed by the ankle.

01:45:25

Okay, so the forest of spirits has more than spirits was the tiger spirit.

01:45:37

Well, uh i'm pretty sure it was just a tiger, but show. Go looks up to a monaro. Oh, it's coming. That was just a tiger. That was tiaking. Unfortunately, his kami was recently slain. He has become inconsolable.

01:46:04

Plane chuckle. Sets up. Someone's killing the comedy.

01:46:14

Mmm, coming can be killed anytime they take physical form. I don't know how he died. Only that he did. There's not been a rash of comedy being slain, if that is what you mean, but even coming our vulnerable in the force, the spirits when they take physical form,

01:46:46

Well. Hopefully he could find peace one day but for now it's been a long day and we should get some sleep.

01:47:03

Okay. Okay, this is not next day yet. Okay. I keep i keep making that mistake. Oh, it's fighting and we can advance to the next day now though. Yes. Boom. Uh, and it's four. So we're actually gonna take our quick break here. And then we have a combating encounter actually coming up like an actual combat encounter.

01:47:24

Who've had the a lot of our pizza day. Litty nearby. Incredibly living break thingy. Where's the brake thingy say, Abby, can i commandeer your time after we're done with the game today? Sure. How do you need uh, somebody to do eaten with? Oh, i've finished off, shadow walk with me and the weapon quests.

01:47:55

So oh yeah. You got to do this. I went there in here. Why are you wearing that?

01:48:03

You don't shot a walk with me before you do it. That's good. Uh i was more uh blown away by. I think maybe you mentioned this but i still was very much not expecting shadow walk with me to lead in back to the warring triad of all things. You know, it's like oh yeah.

01:48:26

Oh my god, i didn't mention that he came with a friend. Where was two of them?

01:48:41

Other than that one was notable. Uh, i was very sad that nobody was in voice chat this morning because, uh, i can never recreate the noises i made when i realized that yoshi was giving me a gundam to play with. Oh yeah. Yeah, the g warrior is pretty good.

01:49:08

Any good? Good, he's pretty good.

01:49:17

Literally, my only criticism is that we don't get to use it more. I i hope it's pretty much, everybody's criticism. Yeah. Like they've given us the mechanics for it and it clearly is like you should have more of this in the future, please. You know, like there's literally a go to the garage menu and check out the parts of the mech.

01:49:42

Like i saw that in immediately thought. Oh, so we're going to be able to edits each part of the mech, eventually like give a different arms. A different head, etc. No, no, no, no. That's strong. But yeah, they're allowing us to like, take poses and stuff like that. So it's cute.

01:50:03

A lot of fun for service right now.

01:50:08

I do hope they come back to it though.

01:50:15

I mean think they've got it. This is not going to be the last time we fought about fight, a boss in the air. And like we have a flying robot. Like, it reeks of this can come back later, right? Like yeah.

01:50:35

Um, the fights themselves were very fun. Uh i enjoy the fact that uh, like apparently everybody naturally comes to the conclusion that the guy in the second boss fight is singing beef. Soft tacos over and over but it, yeah, he's that's just he's just saying be soft tacos. Like he's just saying also be, which is okay because i actually really, really, really like the ultimate song as much as monday greens are amusing like actually really do like that.

01:51:26

Maybe i'll like it more. If i do it more times, uh, diamond. But i think i like emerald better. I think it's my favorite of the three that you are there for someone with the correct opinion and bar-based. Okay. Yeah, because i i also know, the opinion that emotions by far the best home.

01:51:44

A lot of people really that really, really, really, really dislike emerald where people that were farming. It in extreme though. The extreme one is kind of notorious not because it's necessarily hard but the dropper it's on it. Don't exist. People that will like mount farming. Just could not.

01:52:08

Uh,

01:52:16

Man, super sad story. Like fucking for diets. That's i i actually dislike. How much of it is like, oh look boy guys. I'm like, yes, dude is also a genocidal. Yeah, incredibly militaristic imperial commander that led several hundred thousand people to their deaths. I i'm giving him a pass but i could respect that they were going for

01:52:58

A lot of it just feels like rec running guys, and i'm like, please don't

01:53:08

My prayer for today. So, if i kind of feel like it was there, the stories way of making like, uh, like like giving some kind of consequence to who to. So how to the kind of life that guy has lived? And what he the lessons, he instilled in the people who followed him like, yeah, she gets his redemption story but he has to live forever with the fact that he got most of the people.

01:53:39

He cared about killed. Yeah. Did you so you're done with the weapon? Quest. Not right. Yeah, you said yeah. Okay. Did you notice the kids in? Yes, i did. Yeah, so you got you got the the full thing or like, you know, oh well, invite her next time. Yeah.

01:53:57

Yeah.

01:54:11

We will live.

01:54:22

I am returned. Welcome back. Uh, i will be right back. Actually, we need to program a few minutes, your friend.

01:54:37

I cannot tell you.

01:56:06

Then they would have end it again.

01:56:12

It's the hit was really good as well. I mean it fits on like it hits one of two for me.

01:56:22

Entire life. This is white talcos. Should be summoning splitschild diapers. Oh, i know.

01:56:37

I, i do appreciate youtube coming out being like, i see, i see in the book. I i appreciate that. Thank you. I'm back on. Ironically like actually guys.

01:56:53

I mean, you told they got the empathetic impression though, afterwards. Yeah, and then hopefully you too go. No. Is that a compression? Which is, i don't need both arms to serve from right. Hey, you don't know what it's like to being a bunny near big cat. Let alone a big cat that size.

01:57:15

You think your bird friend was nervous? Irritable. Don't you, what the hell do you care?

01:57:27

I'm still a bunny. That can become missed. I'm aware of what you're capable of.

01:57:40

I don't know what powers that white tiger has. This is the poor spirits or not having this conversation right now. I am unconscious.

01:57:51

I mean, i was always in your mind. Anyways, we are not having this conversation.

01:58:03

You two was a figment all along, they're not having this conversation and i'm not admitting that actually, fuck. That would have been really cool story. Twist at the end. I fucking ruin that. I i assumed that was the twist, did i? I totally assumed that like no i had lost her fucking mind but that's not how you have to look at it if it's a figment it's no way's mind giving her the tools.

01:58:36

She actually needs to help herself. Yeah, now she doesn't carefully. Nah, of course, not everything. You need is in you hallmark by youtube.

01:58:56

No, no. I can't i can't. Look, i can't justify lobotomizing. Myself one doesn't work, i could probably get along without an arm but uh, what did i just come back to?

01:59:17

Don't don't worry about it.

01:59:23

Do not worry about it. Or worry about it. A lot? No, you don't worry about it.

01:59:47

Everyone's here. Oh, i don't know. Let's check. Uh, i'm here. But i'm, i'm just going to fill up my glass. I think we might still be missing backness.

02:00:05

Okie dokie. Uh, you would you miss was no way having a conversation with herself. Basically and then the joke that you too, was always a significant familiar the entire time.

02:00:27

Moon therapist. He conjured her own therapist from within herself to help her and you can looked at her and said the power to improve yourself was that you all along? Oh, no. And then i said, hallmark cards but youtube.

02:00:52

It was a lot of saccharine.

02:01:00

This is when you find out that no is actually a massive glutton

02:01:09

She's a secret softy. She's never been allowance to have hallmark cards. That's true and sad.

02:01:22

Isn't any reason you could think of why you wouldn't be allowed into the forest of spirits, no way entire livelihood until about what seven months ago, like

02:01:38

That was way less than that. I forget. How long time, uh, your travel across the crown of the world was three months.

02:01:52

Probably like going. Yeah, because you started out at the beginning of winter and got out at the end of winter.

02:02:02

Which is kind of hilarious since they say that you guys can stay in the crown of the world. As long as you want, i have returned, welcome back.

02:02:14

Uh, so i heard it says that you guys could stay in the crown in the world as long as you want. Wish i assume is in juxtaposition to the book saying, the pcs can't stay in the force of spirits for too long. No. I was making fun of the fact that you were expected to go into the crown of the world at the beginning of winter and exit, the crown of the world at the end of winter.

02:02:39

Yet you can stay in the crown of the world in book three for as long as you want. Like, the two books are in contradiction to one another.

02:02:52

Like if you think about it, winter was four months long for this AP because you guys stop to do that three week montage, gonna need a mountain

02:03:14

Like i didn't even think about it till just now and it's not why we have cherry blossoms because it's spring now. Yes, it is spring. Now, the snows are melting away for us, is actually the first month of spring.

02:03:33

Wait, the the god of depths month is the the first month of spring? I remind you that she is the goddess of cycles and rebirth before she's the god of death. Oh, and water.

02:03:51

I did not know that one at all. Okay, water. One of her domains because she's the goddess of like midwifery and all up. So the idea of life giving a lot of us is basically attributed, different arasma.

02:04:09

Man, she always wanted to play for rasmine like midwife never does funeral services or anything like that. She just delivers babies into the world. She works on that side of the cycle. I'm so there's a british BBC series that i think is incredibly cool called, uh, call the midwife and it's basically around.

02:04:32

I think it starts me the 19th 50s or something like that here, here in the uk, it's kind of a period drama and it revolves around the the nunnery of certain anatas. And all of them under there are like, they're trained in midway. Midwifery, that's what they do. They support like the poorest communities in in South London.

02:04:58

It's a really cool period driver about that and that is exactly the kind of people. I imagine like, midwives of harassment would be because they take no. She's, nope, you're gonna push and you're gonna like it seriously. They're the, um, the, the head of the head of the, the nunneries played by an actress whose name.

02:05:20

I cannot remember off the top of my head but uh, she is legendary for being able to project her ire with nothing more than the quirk of an eyebrow. Um of either of you played pillars of Eternity. Uh no though i would like you shades knows it back to front if you are ever want to conversation with him the subject because one of your party members in, that is a midwife and she's incredibly well-written.

02:05:55

Oh nice. She's she's the party psychic. And uh, she has some of the best dialogue in the entire game.

02:06:09

Nice.

02:06:17

All right. Well, everyone is back. So, yeah, have have dressed in the dressing and graces are back. I'm here? Yeah, yeah. Oh boy, did you guys say anything? I didn't we click the i'm back thing on the yeah, the briefing. I would have stopped the conversation. Oh okay. I'm sending you guys up on the next map.

02:06:42

Anyway.

02:06:48

Do you two have any midwife related literature? You would? Like, i mean, i was there for the birth of my son five months ago, pretty fresh in my mind. Ah, the they missed on my baby mama's epidural, so that was, they had to do it like twice and then, even though she could feel it in her back, like she said, her back hurt more the whole time.

02:07:16

Then giving birth did, i'm up until the very end so that was really rad and it's still cost thousands of dollars. Yeah, i've had the pleasure of a lumbar puncture that i had to do and they were they were diagnosing me. Um, they, they missed. Um, how many times was it internal?

02:07:39

Uh, 30, literally 30 something times. They're right. Oh wow, cheese. My it was it was so painful that i cracked one of my front teeth. Yeah, that'll do it. We we hadn't really made up our mind. Whether we were going to do an epidural or not and then you know, once she started getting a taste of it, we kind of waited too long.

02:08:03

So my girlfriend was like a little bit like curled up and so that, you know, if you're not completely relaxed and slumped forward, it's a lot easier to miss. Um, that was the issue, we believe. But they didn't even we don't think they got it on the second time because she was like, dude, the baby's going to come like i can't stop the baby, but can we like roll me out of my side for just a minute because my back is like killing me.

02:08:26

Like i feel like i'm gonna die and i was like this is my lumbar is literally coming out into the 50 years are tough. Yeah, not a bad pain stuff like that is the worst. Like, even if it's not like super extreme like that, like we just flipped, we have my girlfriend's old king size mattress.

02:08:46

She has a california king and i have a king, and we've hung on to both of them. And we've been sleeping on mine because hers used to mess up my back, but i just flipped and rotated my mattress because it's all slumped on one side now and she's been waking up and just like not been able to bend over at all for like three or four days.

02:09:06

It's the worst kind of stuff, anyways.

02:09:13

Sorry, that was a long thing, but you did ask you about them, okay?

02:09:23

So, as you guys that off traveling,

02:09:31

A few days into the forest. Things are relatively peaceful and calm for a while. And then i'm just gonna say you hear the call because it's the dc 10. You hear a bird call. Oh more importantly though i need a knowledge. Nature, check OG's. Lack of years. Perks up.

02:09:55

First time use i feel like holes on the side of their head like freezer. There's not really like a experience, depends on the species, but yeah.

02:10:10

She'll go. That is not a bird call. That is clearly the call of a yolting creature of some kind. It is poorly executed a yotin. Um, yeah, i will stay in of irresian that. Are that bird? Call isn't real. It's a yo and then OG will turn into grayson and say in common that bird call isn't real.

02:10:43

Unfortunately, i didn't really get a chance to read a book on bird calls. Um, just we got the tiger one but not just tigers and walruses. Yeah. Stereco space asochi says, that is just a tapestry of emotion.

02:11:09

Uh, mine. So there will not be any surprise realms for the stone giants. My bar, i'm sorry.

02:11:21

Well, meet you ye thing.

02:11:42

That's not the right one. We look into the four ones and the stove giants are just doing like a jig.

02:12:08

Just about like on shabby sins. This sounds like commercial music like that sounds like you were about to, like something don't eat medicine. This is a life insurance commercial because we're about to die.

02:12:28

Okay, seriously, there's a oh, one more off topic. While sans is getting this going. Have you guys seen the trailer for the D&D movie?

02:12:41

I am reviewing to take in anything from it now because i want wizards to die. Okay, that's fair. It's a very dnd moment or ttrpg. I, i was really excited after seeing the first trailer, but i literally have to wait the pirate, everything. Now, the one where they speak with that, right?

02:13:05

No, i don't think that's the trailer. So okay i'm gonna post it in chat for those that want to see it. Oh they don't get broiled. You from watching trailers? Or maybe they do, explain it for people who don't wanna no, i have seen the speak with that one.

02:13:23

Yeah, music gear by shopping deals, on reverb, millions of the opinion. That's boycotting. Wizards is like the single. Oh, i mean power to you. They sell magic. They sell cardboard crack. They're always going to have money. Yeah, they got heroin on top. Yeah, but i don't care if magic continues on.

02:13:44

I care about dmv dying and of course, my thing isn't loading. They didn't have to be assholes. Yeah it's a the corporate structure type shit. I read up on it after. No, eight posted all those abby posted all those awesome articles and it's hard for the course. Okay? Capitalism.

02:14:11

All right, so everyone have vision. Yes, illumination is on here. Is coaching out on the back? I am not on the map. Oh, how do you have vision? I have vision of everything. There we go. I didn't even think to check for that which also means you're not on the initiative tracker.

02:14:41

So let's do that roll. But my token wasn't there. I got a 20. If you want me to roll it again. I will. No, i can just update you.

02:14:53

Oh, i have two initiatives now. Son of a bitch. We'll remove this one and now you don't. No way. See here.

02:15:15

Where are they? Oh, oh. I just keep thinking about how much the way is hair. Has grown out and i'm picturing ochi with like super saiyan 3 but feathers. Yes. We need to. Yeah, you're some kind of bird comb or something. Jokos, actually gotten significantly less fluffy. Because it's spring now and he's shedding this is sorry.

02:15:45

That's a wonderful. Thought says, no. Hey, she's dude, the leaf animation. That was dope out. So what happens? I missed it. No ways. Disappear was like a leaf poof do it again.

02:16:05

I was fixing something. Everybody watched everybody zoom in. You don't you don't have now it now. Abby you make up some master class and animations. I'm just saying.

02:16:20

That's pretty neat. Yeah, yeah it's good. It was like a whole thing. Um, the first time i had a lot, some bad shit. It's gonna i would have laughed so goddamn hard of the lightning, bolt effect started. Hey, i know. Not hating you yeeping. Oh, you need that. Um on i didn't name them there.

02:16:50

The names from the bud. Um, they've made the bad dad joke. Grayson, you don't have the travel domain buff, or at least you don't have the icon. I've got it done and just don't have the icon, just making sure. I know everybody except show coke and move like 70 feet.

02:17:12

It is a pretty fast party. Yep. What was it? Who is trying to run away the other day and we were like, okay, so we catch up to them. Yeah. These you catch up to that because all of you can fucking flash step and bullshit. Yeah, straight up. We're a bunch of fucking ninjas.

02:17:30

What are you not like, not literal classes. Functionally lyrics of desna are pretty much ninjas. Pretty. What are sores? Yeah. What are doors and um, but that is written into desmond's document dogma now. And all of my games. What are doors doors are a social constructs is my uh as my dozen monk retailer.

02:18:00

Um, so sorry, i'm just the figuring out distance things. So there's some god of doors, isn't there? I'll set up. Yeah. Um business greatest enemy. Uh not at all actually gonna get along quite well for someone who is local neutral. Um, so what is negative 2 for every every range increment or something?

02:18:32

One of these will probably hit.

02:18:44

Flat-footed. In fact that is the incorrect damage numbers and that did not roll my stick attack. Why did you not romance back?

02:18:56

Why did you not do that game?

02:19:03

You do have clear reach. Yeah, uh the first one actually will hit well, the second one should be at 20, if it is a 20. It is a hit headband of midgets are coming through. Uh, yeah. There we go. That's the extra time. 60 seconds. Sorry about that. So, oh yeah.

02:19:31

First one will do 18, almost, they've got something against precision and the second one will do is six 17 along with bleeding attack. So presumably one of the sure can goes in an eye. Wait, can you fends natural armor with your shuriken? No, has to be smashing. Uh, it's pretty bad.

02:19:56

Yeah. There are piercing, they give me ice watch it and thrown with them. Both the first one.

02:20:13

All right, to use this rock catching ability on the sherikin. Is there a pathfinder equivalent of like the big shuriken? Like the big naruto shirt can start out third knife. What i'm saying? Clerics of that's not our ninja. So, i did the math and i think i did it wrong.

02:20:35

But, uh, like ochy and away are in combat like wearing. We don't wear armor but like wearing like robes or hayori or uh god what do they call shizuku? Yeah. Any, any and all are as fast, if they spend to key point as nfl wide receivers in a 40 yard sprint,

02:21:02

Moving casually. Yes, no. It's it's pretty flat out. That's like double move with the key point. Oh, yeah. But yeah, yeah. That's not the the all out run. No, it's not. If you use the run action. Yeah. You're gonna get so moving casually because the double move is barely a hustle.

02:21:25

Basically half that. Yeah, so twice as fast as a and then i felt what i'd receiver. Boom. Boom. Uh i did a quick look up chalk room. Sorry, thrown weapon that does slashing if they are very wrong area of glarion though. Just don't, don't give me more reasons to try and take.

02:21:57

To approach damage yourself. God damn it. Just points that her hands at the giant and the fire comes out the back of her hands and plaster, something place. I think the funnier part of this is the technically, she fired directly through now. So now he's just kind of looking down at her chest is like oh that's light based interesting.

02:22:27

Right there up to you. Yeah, of course, because i have to get into firing range. Yeah, of course, by the way, you guys can't see this, but the invisibility on her new token, makes her look like she's actually blending into that plant. Right there. It's really cool. Actually, it was

02:22:51

Thanks screening. All right. So that was i might go turn. Bang.

02:23:10

Rows. Two rocks. Yes. Two rocks.

02:23:24

Uh, both of those miss. Yeah. But that first one not by much a large rock lands next to you and the other one flies way over your head. Also nearly missing your friends, it lands like cure. Oh, gee

02:23:51

Og will dry sword as part of a move action and spring attack at the one over here. He's quite far away. Can you get him? Oh yeah, yeah. Oh, she quick. Do i have? I already moved five. Could i move through grazing square? Yeah.

02:24:21

Your allies don't inhibit your movement that you just prevent you from charging, okay? So i already messed that up, but that's five 10 15. It's a lot. I think i can get two of them, but i don't do. I have to keep moving after spring attack. I'm pretty sure i have to move away, don't i?

02:24:34

You do have to move at least five feet away after your spring. Yeah. So you just add five feet. Well i moved and then here so i don't know how to like reset the movement count. No, i'm saying you just act by feet so you can get right to here because you're only at one yellow square out.

02:24:54

So that's an extra five feet. Okay. And so we will do stab. Oh my pictures. Uh i take it you will not be rolling acrobatics though. Spring attack, fair point. You will not be getting a great club to the fates for your troubles yet. Is it evil barrier? I lied.

02:25:27

They're neutral, what?

02:25:45

And then i will move to that corner. It's the eight from skirmish's challenge in there already. No. That's why it's separated because i don't have a way to put it in and take it out for only the first attack on a toggle that i could figure out. So it's just there if i have challenge on then that would apply, but i don't

02:26:19

Hey, video for you. That will be it. I forgot to hit the button everything, uh, greater than like, scratches his head and he's like, what, why are we attacking these? I'm confused. I thought we were supposed to be nice to everything in this forest. They swung. First, they smoke first.

02:26:41

As shugo dodges two giant boulders. Oh, pretty sure. No way in the mako attacked first and it's not so far. We know they're just defending themselves. I i'm really confused to you guys, well, they tried to sneak up on us. Remember, the bird call choco's knowledge. Check will be relevant here.

02:27:04

Does he know that these things have evil intent? Uh, they're probably after your stuff. We're not in the wrong here, right? Princess choco says, no my stuff. I think so. Oh, i mean do any of, you know yolting? No Grayson will call out to them in giant saying hey um right.

02:27:34

Why are you guys here?

02:27:40

Um,

02:27:46

Else smart or stone giants. I don't remember. I thought my head. Yeah, they're all right. Uh, You caravan full of stuff, we're going to take it from you, all right?

02:28:14

I take it diplomacy. Has failed. I wouldn't say fails more. Like just oh they're intentions were where as you say.

02:28:31

You know, jesus christ. Uh oh exactly. Like a bunch arrow will here. Which one? Grayson. Ah, that one, that is a hit. And then a crit, uh, catches the shuriken in that one's eye, and then pushes it deeper into its skull. And then out the back. I want to say uchi for the record.

02:29:05

I tried i tried talking first. I appreciate that. All right. Thanks. Uh, that's it. Oh yeah, a moral quandary.

02:29:42

Always wanted to try this. Oh no.

02:29:54

Oh, she's gonna set the forest on fire.

02:30:02

Uh no, but she just catch that stone. Giant square in the fucking face with the flame strike.

02:30:16

No go. Uh,

02:30:32

And Ashoko will usually move action to move.

02:30:43

Uh,

02:30:48

Okay, i get there. Now, okay. Get there. Only, i have extra movement because i travel domain. That's right. So i can, in fact, get to the other side of this tree that should already be on.

02:31:07

Yeah, it looks like your medium loaded for some reason because you have three strength current friends that would be correct. You have strength train. Oh, even with your mule box times, three is not gonna help you. When you are basically on the verge of being cheated over, uh we should probably take care of that so i could get to behind this tree.

02:31:32

Instead, the point is, i'm trying to get cover from this challenge and i will set up. Where is it? Third magic card time. Everybody throw on haste.

02:32:01

Oh my god.

02:32:06

Oh, no, that's not the right one. I, i

02:32:14

Did you break it again or something?

02:32:28

There's the drum one.

02:32:39

All right. That will be shot. Ghost turn. I'll find a better user drums, so,

02:32:55

You threw fire.

02:33:07

Oh my god. Coy only has 17 ac uh, yep. Well, that's one leather armor. 16 six. Third, i'm honestly surprised she doesn't take more damage. Clear takes damage a lot. Yeah. But,

02:33:35

She does get clipped by one of the rocks though but then kennel spins out of the way of the other one.

02:33:49

Uh, taste is just plus one day you see, right? Yeah, yeah, so it's still mean to beat it.

02:34:01

Yeah, it's it's very much.

02:34:07

Oh, this one back here. Anyway.

02:34:13

Uh, word of warning. If you are 60 feet away from shoco, the you stop being affected by haste that is a fair point. Well, that's not going to be a problem. So i connect the wall, though.

02:34:35

Uh so just as she like takes the step out of your out of your aura, it's worth action to keep the movement going. Basically gets an extra step.

02:34:51

And then, just tries to gouge this particular.

02:35:06

So shave but i at aren't you 20?

02:35:19

Uh, i totally will hit its flagpole racing. Uh so yeah, that one is a true flunting strike. So

02:35:31

Kids begin and loses five of its 11, natural armor. So, out of nowhere, this massive dash appears across its front. Yes.

02:35:56

Okay, a little concerns.

02:36:06

Y'all came to the wrong neighborhood, we came to their neighborhood.

02:36:17

We'll have this conversation. Later shoko. That's the actual catch phrase of this party. We're not having this conversation now.

02:36:36

Questions for later. Kind of panicking. This tries to take a step back swinging wildly with their great club. So we're gonna start with one here, two, three, four, five, six seven. So we're just gonna roll 27 smashes this square here.

02:37:11

Oh, oh, gee.

02:37:17

How fast can you get? Can you you think you could get across the water actually? It's runs across the surface of the water. I do not have that power. That is actually. That's actually what mythic case does. There's the ninja ability to do it too. Yeah. Um, so, but it's deep enough that i can't go that way.

02:37:40

No, it's just the stream so no movement impairment. No, the next question. What's the height difference there? 15 feet 15 feet. That's a 15 acrobatics, right? And then if i do any acrobatics, don't i take, uh, moving cost twice as much. Okay. So that would be two squares of movement.

02:38:10

Let's find out if Ochie's got it the dog in him. Whoa. Wow. People watch dog. Uh oh, she does. In fact, have that dog in him to your doctor about that. So, we will spend a point. Where's my point? Oh lord, when i was messing around. Do you have enough to spring attack movement?

02:38:43

Oh yeah. If i spend the key point which i'm doing and that's, i don't even need to say. Yeah, i am off today. Where's my sorry? I'm gonna take my key points down. I had it at like, 50 still from testing animations. I did not have haste on amigo and oh, yeah.

02:39:16

How does acrobatics vertical jumps play into into spring attack? Would you say running starts? So the increase cc's. Oops, i didn't mean to do that twice. It was slow. Boom. Now as far as going up oh it's i take it. You're not trying to climb? No, i was trying to jump.

02:39:44

All right, so we're looking at a vertical jump of 15 feet up. It's like four per foot. So i'm rarely have to do this math.

02:40:02

Yeah, it's four per foot. I do not make that.

02:40:10

I have the wrong formula in my head so we will revert to our earlier plan. Uh, let's say that i use the and this is not yet factoring in your acrobatics check. You have to make some non-provoking opportunity. Well, okay, so if i could start over because i have the wrong formula in my head for acrobatics if you want to roll that.

02:40:29

Nope, i committed to this and that's fine. But if i spend the key point, i'm pretty sure i can get around because i have 90 plus another 20 maybe not. Boom. Not quite. I mean you you can get up there. That's the double move. Yeah, we'll take the double move and then i'll roll it to not get hit.

02:40:55

Well yeah. So oh no. Because we'll get to right here. Yeah, and then you also start acrobatic thing and your movement will go to have. Yeah, you're fine. As long as you make the acrobatic shake, i rolled the one, our own new one. I lost vision inside the tree.

02:41:17

Wow. You were like, right? Just inside. I think the cmd is only. Anyway, it's giant. I assume i have to roll, like, two of them to get up to him. Uh, it's a 30. So you barely evade, the giant swings. Oh, i only needed the one, huh? Yeah. You.

02:41:45

Um, i just assumed it rolled multiple times, uh, doesn't matter. We did it. So i'm here you only need to make one acrobatics like for a movement. Even if you go through two friends, are we fudging this? Should i have to have been taking the acrobatics speed penalty the whole time?

02:42:09

No, not that. I'm aware of. Okay, you only have to make it once you get into reach and that's when your speed reduces. I've been wrong, no to do acrobatics, to have to you, cut your movement in half to be able to see to be able to do that.

02:42:25

But you can increase the bc by 10 and do it. Full speed. Yeah, i'm not going to do that. We'll take the double move and go half and get up here and just to be safe. I'll say i spent the key point my bar disappeared again,

02:42:49

Okay, it's okay. You're up and melee. Yes, sorry. Well, for all the confusion and my contact tracker is gone. That's weird. Okay, that's my turn. Increase in.

02:43:10

Uh, okay. So, it'll take a five foot step back and then we'll target the one in the corner.

02:43:36

Internet.

02:43:47

That's a hit since he lost five financial armor hit.

02:44:02

And hit.

02:44:09

Down. Downwind. Stone giant. All right, that's this turn.

02:44:35

She can move 80 feet with that.

02:44:41

No, she can move 100 feet with that.

02:44:51

She needs the heal herself before she risks getting in any sort of range with that. Actually, she does not heal the giant wreck that show. Yeah, like queer's being a little risk taker over there. No, thank you. He's she's not the risk taker. She'll go.

02:45:20

Uh, Oh, approach a little bit closer, it will give an uchi the haste buff, the early escape days.

02:45:48

People want to get up there.

02:45:57

Just i keep gracing with them range here. Yeah, it does. In fact, i can go one further.

02:46:21

All right, those guys. 40 feet away. Uh, so i'll have him. Make me a save against.

02:46:44

One of these.

02:46:49

Okay.

02:46:55

Man, i can't wait to play like a fucking paladin and just hit things. It's very comforting.

02:47:11

He's distracted. He's been hit in the face with fire. There's a bird next to him now. Why should you be surprised to that? He made a bird call. He cast commune with birds. That's what that was. He has missed calling as druid.

02:47:38

Oh my god. Just realized his name is fucking me. Oh, there's so many jokes already jokes here. Oh no.

02:47:51

Oh, he misses people. Boom and placed on a fucking tree. Jesus christ. Yeah, a big crushes. The ground next to you LG on both sides. Perfect.

02:48:13

Honestly, no, i'll just rock repair and then just loudly be like, ah, i've got it right girls. Oh yeah, i'm pretty sure. Whoops, watch the blood work is actually.

02:48:53

It'll go you feel that lightning bolt.

02:49:07

Or maybe for you do that, i can only imagine that half of your furs just gone.

02:49:18

I'm sorry. But if you were in your katsune form, i could only imagine half of you is just static electricity, he's dead. Oh shit. It's your turn. This length of lightning just tore through. This giant, are you capable of doing that? Now, let me go and i'm never going to.

02:49:43

It's gonna do some stabs on it. Oh man. This china's taking a flame strike and a lightning bolt.

02:50:00

We're going to spend the key point to do an extra attack. Welcome to being in 10th level. Me arrow in the background. Just going. What the fuck? Okay, cop, i forgot about her again. It's okay. We put it with sander.

02:50:17

Uh, she's weird sometimes she just disappears. Sometimes she's really distance. She doesn't always help you guys fight either. No network though. Oh, i feel like this was a touch overkill. Oh well the second uh no. The first attack brings him down. Oh she just goes full fucking sandosu on this giant.

02:50:45

Yeah, it's just fine out.

02:50:52

Uh, so that triple attack bisex and decapitates the giants before it falls dead to the ground, okay? And then i know she's gonna fight for staff into the tree, i guess.

02:51:16

I oh i'm not selected on the character uh, shoko will end his performance and that was so fast that we're not even tired.

02:51:28

No, i just reappears and like golf clubs.

02:51:35

Yeah. Okay. Then that was it was very impressive. Shogo everyone is. All right, i mean, oh gee. Sorry. Not sugar who says he did watch the lightning. It was impressive. We're saying it's impressive. Oh yeah, thank you. Coyote, i've been practicing. You come quite far as since that little nestling you should be very proud of yourself pride as a sin.

02:52:14

I think i don't know and he gives Shogo knuckles and he says noodle arms gang. Uh, yeah, give him nicole, his arm collapses in on himself. Um i don't think no, she is much stronger than me. 12 strings right now. I'm very much stronger than you but normally. Yes.

02:52:37

Oh you have way yen strength. Okay, let's put that in perspective for you. My rabbit is stronger than you are. No, i'm sorry weigh-in. Has a strength of four.

02:52:52

Oh, can you are? This isn't going away that thing. Yeah, i'm gonna go back to the party. Um, so you all remember when the ninja poisoned me back in agon. Hi, yes. Uh, that hasn't gone away. I thought it would by now as you're talking about this. Oh, geez, is gonna know what Grayson's gonna do and so he's gonna help him roll the bodies over so he can get into the pockets.

02:53:26

Good. I mean, actually Grayson was looking around to see if gosh it was miro is around and if she is he's going to be like where to go show her. Wait. Thanks for vanquishing them all. Wow. Uh, it's that fucking, it's the twitter meme of like i just want to say i like yesterday when you saved those puppies from that tree, that was super cool of you.

02:53:54

Thanks like on tomorrow your lambo shoko. That was real. Yeah. Behavior of you. Uh but yeah uh yes i believe. The problem was the diamond dust a thousand goals worth of diamond dust. Is what is currently missing? And I'll say a prayer over the giants.

02:54:20

Don't suppose there's another way around that per shadow. Essence recovery. Probably not, certainly don't know. Uh, does anybody have a way of grinding diamonds? Because we've got uh over well over a thousand gold worth of diamonds. Right there. We do. Yeah. We we got this bag that had 33 uncut, diamonds worth, 100, gold each and then we've got this one big diamond.

02:54:54

That's where 300 gold. Where is that subs? Like makes grabby hands. It's a diamond. Yeah, that's why we we held on to them was just uh, for your dude, okay? Just don't step in front of me.

02:55:13

La como. Well, coya is going to be casting shatter and shout at the times. Ah takes a very strong step back and you know the ground is rent asunder and the cone of the shout as shout, this want to do

02:55:37

That's my hands old token at him. Oh yeah, i was gonna say that's isn't that almost hoyas old token. I thought we switched hard for her if it doesn't just take her. Just take. Oh yeah, was coming to to heal you. Boom. And no, this is this is the switch.

02:56:03

Start up koya. Never got really good art. I like her original art, but there's no high resolution versions of it anywhere. So she kind of just looks like a weird witch which is not an accurate, it's not at all. Oh, okie dokie. One, restoration coming right up. Uh, you will have to camp because she did not have a prepared.

02:56:42

All right, i'm just gonna rub some diamonds into it. That's,

02:56:50

No. Actually that of course why why wouldn't reality allow the rich to get through a problem by literally pouring money on it?

02:57:01

You can probably think avidar for such constantly components being required for these magics. I don't think i will.

02:57:18

You're not resisting the restoration, right? Oh no, no.

02:57:25

I don't think bards can take superstitious.

02:57:37

Because then she also uses it on herself. Oh right. She was also, uh-huh. All right, i'll take another and punching up.

02:57:55

All right, anyone else? I'll take a granddaughter here, but no. Of course meant. Is anyone else need restoration actually? Do we have enough diamonds? We should keep those on hand as often as possible. We're going to be encountering this. Terrible poisons. Uh we've got about uh 1600 gold left of them.

02:58:33

That's another restoration then.

02:58:38

Thanks coya. I feel 20 years younger. You don't look it. Watch the way space just darkness and he walks into the river. No, it just looks to meco like Circuit just walks into the river. It is never seen. Again, i have been outburned. This is where shook of story ends.

02:59:12

I see just lays down and likes for the water to take him.

02:59:23

Oh sorry.

02:59:32

No, no. She cozy out of the water and you guys carry on. Well, everyone can hit the rest.

02:59:45

Oh my goodness. Okay, so good forest. It's often, it's often. Welcome to poachers, is it?

02:59:58

Go choose. What else would you call them giants?

03:00:11

Oh, but i would have slipped to the trees invisible.

03:00:18

And there are many of them out here in the forest, not many. But some always, some she runs past turns into an actual fox and darts into the bushes. I don't like her.

03:00:38

We could go. I think and i know she turns into a bird and flies up into the tree. He he what? Just kidding. Okay, no one expects it from a tengo.

03:00:56

Everyone expects kids and native shapeships. Thank you. Can i'm just not spending the fuse for that.

03:01:08

Pretty good at it.

03:01:22

Your next one.

03:01:35

Don't i like special traits like i since i i have the the shape changer type, right?

03:01:46

I don't think anything that gives me has coming up. Come up yet in this campaign. But i'm in the big one is that no one's tried to forcefully. Hit you with polymorph effect, right? Yeah, because you can just shape change the back to whatever the most appropriate so you can effectively undo it with Belleville column.

03:02:11

Okay, as long as you keep your faculties, you can just change back.

03:02:25

Nothing my character about that but you know, i do.

03:02:40

Okay, interesting.

03:02:50

Very interesting. Uh, all right, let me see.

03:03:00

Christen you don't speak tien, right? Ah, that is correct. So the spirit of a beautiful young teen woman sort of appears out of the trees near you. They didn't give me any arc, where unfortunately, i am lead to share with me and they will teach you our words.

03:03:31

Is that that's in common? That's in common. I do need you to roll a wheel save though.

03:03:49

All right, you do not merge with her though. It is not forceful or painful in any way and you get the impression that she's good like she just wants to teach you tien.

03:04:09

Uh, did anybody else just see that? Turn to look. Yes, there's a ephemeral Tian woman. That is in front of Grayson.

03:04:27

Do i need to do? I need a punch. A ghost, uh, grace. I'll take a step back from her and be like, i'm sorry. I i was told not to talk to spiritual uh strangers uh i need nochi here in order to to take over.

03:04:55

I know she will step up and say hello, do you enjoy singing? Um, not much of a singer. I find a very beautiful though. What you sing with me?

03:05:17

I thought you wanted to teach my friend. He does not wish to learn.

03:05:24

Um, okay. I will sing with you or do you know? And then i had to have no idea what the name of a song in the pathfinder. Universe would be. So she moves over and tries to touch you. The spirit of the well or something like that. Boom. And unless you actively evade her touching you on i need you to rule will now let her touch me, but then i will use resolve to resist it and take two rolls.

03:05:59

Where's my resolve button?

03:06:10

This really the only spirit token i have with the woman. I know i have more than that.

03:06:19

Large ghost.

03:06:25

Spirit tokens. Oh, you also do not wish for this. It would be nice if you would tell us where you're trying to do. Forgive me a thing and teach forgive me if i'm a little suspicious, they're people trying to kill us.

03:06:50

What is killing? So, very nice thing to do.

03:07:04

Kind of drifts through you. You liked thing.

03:07:17

I'm gonna punch the ghost.

03:07:22

Can i like make any sort of check here if to see if i recognize what kind of ghosts? This is, it's a spirit, not a ghost, what kind of spirit? This is. Yes, it's a. Do you have knowledge jade regent, ap specific creatures. It literally is that uh but Shoko could this is this is basically a haunt.

03:07:52

This is before haunts were written, they are kind of like honest actually yeah. Yeah, they're closer.

03:08:04

It's actually spirits are incorporal but they are not creatures. That can simply be destroyed in combat. They function more like humps but are not limited to a specific location and are not necessarily evil or vengeful.

03:08:21

Who's it? Trying to sing with? Now with amigo. Choco says, spirits aren't necessarily evil. I say we treat her the way. We would treat a normal person and give and not be so immediately hostile. And oh, she says a normal person who walks up to you in the woods and says sing with me and touches you

03:08:49

My honestly, if you'd said no person, i think i am drink normal person.

03:08:57

Okay, i won't stop you. Then did she just possess honica, she touched all my cow? I make a smiled and started singing quietly.

03:09:16

All right, you. Good omiko said, holiness behind This one.

03:09:35

And then like shogo or Grayson is just like, eating tomatoes.

03:09:45

Because ice glow slightly if she gets something cool. I'm going to be mad at myself. It's all right. And yes she does just sing then and just starts walking.

03:10:01

Uh, yes, i may go is actually going to get a permanent bonus to perform, sing and talk tien. But she already spoke to him. Grayson, you could have been a barred archer. Her fancy goes up her. Fluence, it does. In fact, go up yes. Uh, since she already has ranks and performance thing, she gets a permanent plus, one bonus.

03:10:33

We weren't all so suspicious and we could all speak to n from here on. I think it's a one person thing, but, yes, i'm gonna be honest. I'm surprised that, uh, tend no suey's even letting this happen.

03:10:56

To stop it. I would have had to exert control over the princess that i am bounded. Not to exert over a scion of the amitatsu.

03:11:14

All rulers must make their own decisions. Well, at least the lady has a beautiful singing voice not much, is there. I think we all would have probably suffered had grace and decided to start singing for the next. Her name is lead. Su they color. The wandering song.

03:11:38

She was murdered in the forest about your bowers head and say a prayer for lisu.

03:11:48

Never a good story, but

03:11:54

I think we will find that many of the spirits here are like this, some worst another. So,

03:12:06

Wonderful.

03:12:13

To do and you think that's going to be uh spirits here that like they came to the forest. And they had such a great time that they passed away, happy and yet their spirit lingers to share that happiness with others.

03:12:34

No, don't worry. No way. Just answer that but she just like, frowns really hot.

03:12:50

You read enough stories for around these parts and you learn that most of them don't have happy endings.

03:13:03

Not when it comes to army. Anyway, and sugar is that why you're so sad all the time, you read a lot of stories,

03:13:21

I guess you could say that. Yeah, though, i would say it's more because i've seen a lot of them stories.

03:13:38

Oh, that's one more tragedy on the path.

03:14:01

We are not the heroes of a tragedy. We're gonna get to minkai, so let's go.

03:14:21

I really hope this fog is just fog, it's never just fog. Does it ever been just fog? A fox could dream? Can't he? No.

03:14:50

Nope, let's turn that off. I will prove that wrong with a google search. Do foxes dream of electric sheep. That's all. Just what does it mean to have foxes in your dreams bunch of new age bullshit?

03:15:17

Dreams about foxes attacking you.

03:15:28

You do not belong with them princess soon to be empress.

03:15:43

Why is there a giant health bar at the top of the screen?

03:15:54

How's he doing? I heard him out the bullying. You? Oh, that's what the fog is, isn't it? What? Oh, thank you. Did we all hear that? Yeah. Yes, she belongs on the throne. Wait, why is the oh, that is a big health bar.

03:16:27

Did we literally just step through a fog gate into a boss fight?

03:16:34

Oh, the fog. Solidifies into a samurai they there's a striking resemblance to Prince. Uh, fuck. That's the car, mr. Smiles. Yes, i will free you from them and we will rule together.

03:17:07

So she'll go that's a 33 and then a 25 to confirm against your flat footed. Ac. I mean, yeah, yeah, that'll that'll definitely do it. Uh uh shoko eats a crit into his fucking spine. There's a combat track here, everyone.

03:17:40

Uh, and anyone even vaguely sensitive to spirits. Commies the occults anything.

03:17:49

Uh, the anger radiating from this spirit is helpable also his cruelty.

03:18:06

And actually shoko give me a knowledge, local,

03:18:18

Actually, no way. Did you spend any time in hungle? No, they do.

03:18:32

Choco, you've you're pretty sure. You know what spirit? This is uh, unashi titsuki, the anger of storms, an angry samurai known for his cruelty to prisoners Onashi was killed by his escaped convicts during a revolt.

03:18:59

Oh, okay, you're not expecting. Oh, okay, this one's bad. We could kill this one.

03:19:38

Oh jesus, i might go. Okay.

03:19:45

Oh, i should take five reduced damage from that because of the bone, forgot.

03:19:58

I mean, it's but i'm not.

03:20:13

Both, i don't mean his sheep.

03:20:20

Um, makeo.

03:20:27

Heard incaporiel.

03:20:38

Oh, gee only like half my animations are working. Now something i met something up in the sequencer layer. And yeah, so there's quite the large boss bar, isn't it? Yes.

03:21:04

Okay. Um,

03:21:10

He's going to get your sequence around. This is about to go badly, you will not harm the princess, draw your blade and he's challenging. This spirit.

03:21:32

That worked cool. And then move action.

03:21:48

Gonna take critical focus for this fight. So any of my career roles will be for higher? I don't know how to do that yet. I was looking at them and it looks like it's gonna be complicated and then i'll take i don't have my weapon out. So for my standard action, can i downgrade it to a move and draw my weapon?

03:22:12

Uh, yes. And what was the ability you wanted to do critical focus? Um it was between that or improved critical. I can put it on confirmation rules but i was thinking about. Yeah, that is where you would put it. Yeah. Oh, add it in there but i'm i won't be able to attack this turn anyway so i draw my weapon and then that's my turn.

03:22:38

Okay. Uh greason as he steps forward will say, is it? So this is a spirit. It is he possessing the prince

03:22:57

Um,

03:23:00

Uh, no. No, it's not. It's just a spirit of a very bad guy and it kind of looks like the prince

03:23:27

Many. Does he have it? Only got three attacks of opportunity. Uh, i do not provoke when firing my bow. Nope that's fine. That's not what's happening. The 21 and the 19 miss actually, um, oh yeah, he already know. Because it's a surprise attack. All right, so there are three that will hit.

03:24:00

These are the cut from the ears. I privately, oh, He attempts to raise his katana deflect, the arrows that were going to strike him and does not succeed.

03:24:23

But he moves very fast. And then, i actually think is annihilated

03:24:37

Probably he's actually solid. I thought he was ankle boreal. That's right. He is inquirrel, then? Why do you get correct?

03:24:47

Let me redo this damage. Oh, enjoyed seeing the bar. Go down that fast. Okay. Well enjoy, it's like want to go back up. Not that i wanted to take that from you but like, okay. And your weapon is magic but not ghostach, right? Correct. So, half damage, i think it is correct.

03:25:18

I thought you were gonna take care of the deadliest spirits by far very quickly.

03:25:29

And that's great. Some string. Uh, these spirits are they undead?

03:25:39

Shoko are they? They're not actually uh, they're not actually. Okay, bike would step back. Deadly. Aim rapid shot. He's got no more attacks opportunity for blocking. I'm still on self roll.

03:26:02

Uh, but he manages to block coyote attacks. Anyways, no way. Oh, if it's a ghost, not even gonna bothering with my weapons.

03:26:19

I'm not a ghost. I'm your wife.

03:26:27

Oh, not even. You know what? Just for that swift action to get the extra attack. Is this another british thing. What those are Princess? Bride thing. Oh, i don't remember something. That's right. Wait, how old are you? Bang? This, i'm 28. That's not as young as i thought. Uh, versus that gets, uh, you have the ghost touch.

03:27:12

That i apply those image. No. So i'm going to take kids the third attack meses though.

03:27:25

The angry with sound.

03:27:32

And you think it is for you shoko, here.

03:27:42

Um, uh, creatine still thinking that the foxes in the, the pushes are like choco save us. We need, you took a wall. Five foot step. And are these things immune to mine affecting effects.

03:28:04

Uh, hey don't know. Let me scroll back up to the spirits description.

03:28:19

Here we are. If i enter my boom,

03:28:45

No. All right. Well then five foot step. Maybe bonus action to inspire courage.

03:29:03

Everyone gets that. Uh and then i will target this pillow with one of these.

03:29:36

I mean no. I just said they were immune to manufacturing. Well you you said they? I heard you say you. They weren't so uh, i thought she said can they be affected by minded by things? So my answer was no. Okay. Okay. My question was, is, are they then instead?

03:29:59

Can i just a good hope the party? Of course.

03:30:08

Uh not not uh i do not target the, the ghost target all of you. Everyone gets good home, but he would also like good hope.

03:30:24

I'm sorry, i don't it's only so much to go around.

03:30:39

Oh, and i apparently turned it on, on no way. Not omiko. Yeah, apologize. Also, you're welcome. Yes, thank you. I'm just trying to put it on. Did i just turn it off of you? You may have it's fine.

03:30:59

Uh, shoko, 5 footsteps away, uh, targets targets targets. Uh, so, uh, like a samurai. Do he pulls his blade in back to his side and then sweeps out making an attack at each of you.

03:31:24

Boom single attack against all of you at once.

03:31:37

Thank you, boom. I'll do it. Yeah.

03:31:46

All right, it's reject 22 and that is his turn.

03:32:00

Wait, this guy gets to cleave without having to make the two extra rolls, kind of being clean model when the time or something. That is correct.

03:32:20

Phone. Both of those hit touch. I see.

03:32:27

Ochi.

03:32:34

It's a good hope and inspire courage. Yeah. One's competence one's moral. Boom. I did not have it. That's okay.

03:32:50

I wish i could just draw an AoE and auto apply it to all of you. Uh, so that thing about chewy,

03:33:01

Here is hyper autumn literally was just doing that on my barred this morning.

03:33:10

We'll use a key point to do some extra attacks.

03:33:19

Evil extraordinarily. We do not have haste right now, right? I'm pretty sure it turned it off. We do not have hace right now, cool?

03:33:36

Is there a way to add the oh, i'll click now because does the haste. Check box. Give you an attack bonus because i'll use it for my extra key attack. No, it just gives you the expert back. Okay, cool. You also have a flanking with no way but it is good for getting that extra attack when you need to for it.

03:33:58

No way. Who is throwing hands?

03:34:15

So you return almost in identical wounds of the one he opened up Shoko with and his spirit disintegrates

03:34:37

Why did that look like the prince? That wasn't the prince, right? Uh, with my knowledge, local strike. Do i know of any connection between him and the prince? No, he probably just took the the image of someone. You knew to be a terrible person. I think he just took the form of someone we would hate.

03:35:01

Also, they gave me no token images for any of these so i'm improvising, that's fine. It's perfect.

03:35:15

Pretty.

03:35:20

Almost broke it. All right, so after this very exciting afternoon, you find that the stone giants had a house, a little ways up the hill from you. Let me go ahead and clear these weather effects. Boom, although welcome to the forest spirits. Oh, we're not just now getting into it.

03:35:43

No, this is just your first real encounter with a bad spirit.

03:35:51

You do. So the giant's house is built on top of a tour. Not far from where they ambush you, the houses, they crudely built mishmash of wooden stone, but it offers the giants, a warm and dry place to sleep. There are six comfortable rooms in the house. Each heated with a great fireplace.

03:36:12

In addition to plenty of salted meat and cured meat equivalent to 20, cargo units of caravan stores. So a lot of meat some of it's probably questionable the house. Contains the 25 foot long woven tapestry worth 300 golds, two white tiger skins worth, 250 gold apiece, two bolts of fine silk worth 140, gold piece, and three barrels of very good sake.

03:36:38

Worth 50 gold apiece, huh? It's quite a lot of loot. They've been taken from people um, surprised that they were able to hunt down some of those tigers without the comic getting angry at him. The comment do not take physical forms. They can die when they do meow, says appearing from the bush.

03:37:24

I that doesn't make sense. I'm gonna be real bad. Did the um, did the giants happen? Have anything of interest on their bodies, all right? They did have loots. I'm a rolling that for you right now uh the first roll didn't really make a lot of sense. So,

03:37:56

Awkward they go.

03:38:06

There we are.

03:38:13

We are feet and that's right.

03:38:22

You know, a known with technically had our own rooms back Alice. But is slow. It's actually feels like the first time i've slept in a bed months. What do you mean both the palace? It was like yeah, you want grayson? Thank you.

03:38:55

The palace just was awful. Place to know that we were in the company of such a terrible man. As certainly didn't lend itself to good nights of sleep. Imagine not, no.

03:39:21

And, but i post.

03:39:28

And before that, we were tracking across the frozen north. Which if you ever decide to go to somewhere other than telling jaw, i would recommend a bow.

03:39:44

They're not complaining about the cold again. They'll shook oh no, the cold was actually fine. I tend to grow quite the thick winter coats. Apologies for that, by the way. Let's see reaches over at brushes some shed for off of your shoulder that's going to be key. That's going to be happening for about a month.

03:40:10

Uh, nose more. The undead chasing us halfway across the foreign expanse that i could do without. Oh yeah. Why button almost dying of neurotoxin. And the, the dragons and

03:40:35

Um, up history.

03:40:42

300 dp. Uh, miro looks extraordinarily sad when she sees the two white tiger skins.

03:40:56

What should we do with them? They are already passed. All we can do is more than their spirits and treat what remains of them with respect. OT will say a prayer over the tigers and the probably dead people and the beatboxes. Yeah. And then all dead people. Are you comfortable?

03:41:23

Some of it is dead tiger, some of it is dead tiger. It also makes you uncomfortable to know that there are many more director tigers than this forest. Grayson doesn't say it out loud, but in his mind, he's like, man i could make some good stuff out of those.

03:41:44

Uh, tiger skins.

03:41:49

Ah, well if nothing else. Grayson from make something decent type of those tigers. Oh no, i was just thinking that you know, me a little too well i think and it's the practical answer. If we turned what remained to them into things that we could use to fight against the regions and those who would dispoiled this wars than i think, that would be you with your great honor for the spirit of just trying to messages and she not say, like this is the only path you should be taking really go, you know?

03:42:28

See i'm sorry. No, it's grace. Another shoulder. Havoc is guys talking about after you. Tigers are fierce and strong, perhaps you could make some form of tatamido.

03:42:49

Or heyori, shoko. Cox's head who made your armor neuro and your weapons, for that matter. Hey, i know it's not quite time yet, but i have to get going a little bit early today, guys. So, uh, okay, we're close to wrap up time. Yeah, yeah, sorry, i would love doing the rp stuff.

03:43:11

I've just been out of it today and the baby's like, losing his mind. I gotta rescue my girlfriend. Okay, thanks guys, we'll see you next week. Hopefully, bye. Go see your kid.
