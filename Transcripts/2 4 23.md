00:01

Awesome yetis. Then we box, uh, some, uh, some some spooky boys who paralyzed half the party in push show going to a pit.

00:19

Um, and that's about all that happened, huh? I we had much fun making jokes about oh abby. Jokes about Abby. I was actually doing a recap and i got, i just thought into the point where, oh, shadow landed a butter side down in the pit. Um, they call me way better than i expected.

00:47

It.

00:53

Oh my goodness. Okay.

00:59

Please really, i'm good. I will thrive.

01:06

Um, what else happened? I don't think anything else happened after that.

01:19

I mean, i know i had to leave like right into the combat finish, so if there was anything after that, i missed it.

01:30

Maybe, does anyone have anything they'd like to add then?

01:40

Training at the beginning for that was very much. Um, because everyone here. So, uh, the actual thing that happened was, yes, we we started out at, um, jogging, i'm gonna say the town was

02:03

Never fucking remember the name of that crap.

02:13

Yes. All right. Uh,

02:19

So um jogging was uh we spent a month and a bit there uh having a training montage in the snow uh reeling stuff on my code became a sorcerer uh shoko got a bit better at casting. Um, no way got something. What did no idea?

02:48

Now, i figured it out how to roll like a ah, um, uh. Oh she i want to say ochi retrained to be able to better use that that big katana. He got? Yeah, i dropped my two weapon fighting. I'm a single blade boy now. All right. Uh, and grace, and spent, the time crafting, i believe, uh, learning how to work with leather, ah,

03:24

Um, then we attempted to go through the main pass to uptown humble and it was blocked by the living storm. Those being controlled by the lady, we killed on top of the pout, the tower of tatiana, tatiana, something like that, one of those two.

03:49

Um, coyote told us that she had a dream of a tunnel through the mountains, carved by worshipers of desna. So that's souls, could make their way north here. If you notes played on omega's loot slash shellmiston and then secret, come on. Yeah, my entire takeaway about the does nothing was just desna rocking in your dream.

04:20

Like hey, here's the thing. Can you go and deal with it? And then you get there and it's fucking lethal. And she's like, sorry, then leave, i'm guessna. Just doesn't things. Fucking i'd be quiet. No, that's fine. We going going through the tunnel and we encounter some yetis who proceed to not put up that much of a fight uh even though they all had barbarian levels and uh amulets of armor on.

04:59

And we surmise that the tunnels have since been desecrated by worshipers of bad tea on deity who uh, for miyoshi so i have not right, it was fumigoshi okay, and

05:31

And so we decided to go forward cautiously and we found more signs of desperation and then we came to a crevice with a bridge over it and the bridge is protected by an anti-life field. Uh, and we went up to the edge of the crevice to look over and see what was down there and that the trip, the trap to make a bunch of, uh, headless wardens.

05:54

I want to say they were called pop out of their little doors. And which i like to remind everyone, we're campaign. Specific monthly created forces. Um, a special abilities are special for this place. Yes, here. Who i blame for this? Got it, what? No, still not. Me build, not my doing.

06:26

Um, one of them kicked struggling up for paralyzing happening party. Uh, if it, you know, that brings up an interesting idea, what have happened, if like, they had successfully paralyzed like a lot of us and then, through the lot of us into the pit. Like, how would we get out of that situation?

06:46

How would we climb back up with them looking down on us, you think?

06:53

I they probably train like kill you. If you climb back up.

07:01

Okay. Uh, it feels like the encounter was designed for that to happen because they are encounters were pises. Like this is a fucking encounter. We're trying to murder you guys. Did i consider them their? Personagement however with the just a bit of damage to shoko, thanks to my purchase of cat's boots in yakin uh we managed to overcome the challenge.

07:35

It was super clutch for real. That's one of the best foot focuses i've seen in a while. Um,

07:52

And that is when we find ourselves, i don't know if it was mentioned but the cool glowy thing. Here is the anti-life field. Anti-life shell? Yeah, which is why we can't go forward. The walk scarier than incentives. Just enforce field.

08:24

But other than that, it all sounded good. Yeah, and these two towers are now open for us to explore. This is me clapping. Good job. Scheduling some guys. We did it.

08:44

But for highness can stop leaping off of cliffs before telling people that she can tether fall, though. I feel any of you tell me you could. I'm a fucking ninja and chuckles weird. Just i i couldn't exactly talk when i was being pushed over just for the record. I can't do that.

09:07

So, if i go over a cliff, please, please save me.

09:18

Show of hands. Everybody who is cliff proof. Please raise your hand, it's okay. Oh gee i believe in you. I don't think something is measly as well. That's what 80 foot drop would be enough to put you out of commission and OG takes a couple steps away from the cliff, actually, an 80 foot drop is not likely to harm or finish you at this point.

09:42

My bones are horrible. They are that's fair but you have 77h, hp down. Um, pass under mechanics questions. Is there a cap to fall damage? I usually kept at 20 d6 rules is written 20.60. Yeah. Okay the problem is when you can, yeah, when you can fall from enough, i did terminal velocity either.

10:10

You're just not gonna survive unless you have a fucking featherful and your wizard, who's like a adrenaline junkie? Well, well, the problem with that that i've run into in D&D 5e, is that people would take away though, the other fall cap because no, of course, terminal velocity should kill you.

10:27

And with that ends up turning game into is the wizard polymorphs. The bad guy, the druid flies him a thousand feet in the air. At drops them. Yep. And you you see that happen a few times in your life like okay no the fall damage capture. Yeah, no, i see that happen a few times and, you know, your enemies gets smart, if they become the standard tactic, your enemies start, having things of like rings of feather fall.

10:54

Yeah, gm will punish you for doing stuff like that tactics. Come counters. Tactics fun tidbit about the only other real session i've ever played. I played at Oracle and somebody else's uh, like high level end of their campaign session and i was trying to be a debuffer and i didn't build my character, right?

11:14

Because i didn't understand dc's and spells it all. So nothing works but i did hit like a huge or colossal creature with something that made them fall prone. And the guy was really, really nice and ruled that it took fall damage from. It's like waist height and that was great for me, i felt super happy about that.

11:39

I mean, as a bigger person who is a constantly afraid of tripping because i might die. I can see what why? You would oh yeah. I have fallen off a skateboard, the first time i ever allied and that's, you know, from roughly way sight and then i fell on a roof.

11:58

One time i slipped on a really mossy wooden shingle and landed on my tailbone and the result of both of those as i have a fractured tailbone, you don't have to fall from very high for it to hurt at all.

12:17

Anyways. So, which tower do we want to do first? I've i, i i'm not one of those people that shared that appear. Unfortunately, i didn't really have anything to add to that conversation. I was i've always been a monkey. I role places. Oh, now, oh geez. Oh, she's scared of falling.

12:39

I'm not, i've fallen off of lots of things. It just ain't gonna lie. I'm kind of scared to fall right now because like, feel like i made up glass pretty much constantly. At the moment get a bubble suit. No, it's just as soon as my energy comes back, i'm going to start going to the gym again.

12:58

You don't i miss it. I needed. All i can do is yoga right now and it just doesn't scratch the itch. No, so is there any difference in the appearance of these towers or they're pretty much matching? They're pretty identical. Actually and i have booked free open. Not book two, that's not helpful.

13:22

Specifically. This is book three, wait then we'll book it. Oh, that's book. Four. I'm even farther than i thought, know, into the force, the spirits. I need the hungry storm. Also get it. The hungry storm. I hate it. Yeah, sometimes they're they're both names. Could be better about one brand of wonderful isn't.

13:56

Like the last one called, like night of frozen shadows. That was the second. Yeah, those that was book. Two. Yeah. The, the last one we did. Yeah, it was yeah. Also it was a boo against all the ninjas of that name. And i mean, the books, the first book was the brainwall legacy.

14:13

So jade region. Just does not have super great names. Yeah. The first book has like, does it like say anywhere on the book? Like, hey, this adventure will eventually be tea on famed. Like, does it say that anymore? Oh it does okay because i yeah. Okay, the players guide might even mention it does you will be going to john, okay?

14:40

Okay, because i think i remember like looking for the tea on jaw a baby and see like the the name, the brainwall legacy thing. That's probably not it. And skipping pasta. That that is impacted the name of the last three books are the forest of spirits, which is the next one.

15:02

Hide of honor and the empty throne. I think i remember reading that this dumps you off at like level 14. It is possibly the lowest level of the books. Yeah, i look them up and a lot of them are like 16, some 15. And this is like one of the few that dumps you off 14 team lower than this is councilor fees, which is actually 10 beyond.

15:32

It's almost like individual account, interesting.

15:42

Not, it's not fun. I know what i want to do. Second darkness at some point but no one ever seems interested in it two. Second darkness, i have a character idea for it.

16:02

It is i i just like galarian strow, they're different. Yeah. Also dark laps. I like yeah you tell them it's the dark clans AP and people go. Okay, but how dark labs is it and we go.

16:18

So steps into the tower and explodes.

16:29

He looks around. What does he see? I don't know. I'm still not to that part in the book yet. I was good. That's why everyone was kind of building the silence for me, circle steps into the tower and sees the jade regent in front of him. Oh no, that would have been rude.

16:46

As fuck. Are you kidding me? Please stop. Here we are. The wonderful tower kill the region. Now, is that explain why the last book is called the empty through, right? Well the region is you know, just a i'm not a real real ruler. Maybe it's a ministers thing. It's got a smaller throne next to the jaythrone to kill.

17:10

Dinosaurs behind. Dude. I listened to a remix of that. Literally this morning that made me cry. Please don't push that much. The song fucking kills me. Uh thinking about care about bringing you be just hilarious way that he does. He the actor in the portrays him, wrote that song.

17:37

Uh Kevin no not pepper king. No, no wrote the song. Yeah, that's crazy. I also was surprised to find out. It was him singing? Yeah. All right. I am here. This octagonal structure half buried within the stone walls of like of the cavern. Rice is 20 feet above the cavern floor.

18:03

Inside a narrow stair. Along the wall leads to a small balcony, allowing observers to look out the towers slit windows. A dark corridor leaves leads deeper into the rock.

18:20

And that description is identical for both of these, so the balcony being the area 20 feet up. But if you continue through the tower, there's like a tunnel thing. Gotcha.

18:35

Oh, she's gonna take his still. Sheath sword and poke shoko in the back with it and pushing forward a little bit.

18:45

Do it? Okay, i get the description again. Sorry, is octagonal structure, have buried within the stone walls of the cavern. Rice is 20 feet above the cavern floor inside a narrow stair. Along the walls leads to a small balcony allowing observers to look out the towers slit windows. A dark corridor then leads deeper within the rock.

19:10

So, inside this main room here, this little ledge thing that's kind of drawn is up in the air, and then it just goes straight into this little tomb area.

19:24

All right. Uh which are open niches that line, the walls of this narrow corridor within which live funeralary buyers in a scattering of ancient grave, goods grace and you're going to want to get in here. No, i'm thinking of splitting apart and going down this one. You won't, sorry, i will challenge.

19:48

I was about to say, the anti-magic shell extends and separates the party magically, that'd be a big move.

20:02

Uh, shirco's gonna try and fish for ambushes here with a quick. Oh casting of dancing lights. Uh, i can send those like individually. Like down each of these little outcomes. They're literally just little pewtery beers.

20:22

All right.

20:27

Nothing pops out at him, then shoko will continue on to the door.

20:34

And open it. Actually, i believe find those doors to be locked. It is locked. Nope, they came out. They're open. I had those wardens were in here. Oh,

21:01

New funeral buyers lie in this chamber. Pictographs of the dead rising from their graves, to attack the living, our carved and painted on the walls. A twilight tundra on the left side of the room before moonlight mountains in the center, and a starry snow field on the right.

21:22

Interesting. I like i'm drawing a stories. No.

21:29

Huh. So these are these pictograms these and these uh designs. Do they look like fumiyoshi symbols again? Yes. Okay. Which means he it was likely his cultists that brought these dead back to life. Yeah, just spoiling the the uchthal and necropolis.

21:56

Um,

22:05

Patient's going to look for hidden. I don't know, cavities passageways, etc. There's actually nothing hidden in here. All of the grape goods are just out on the stone and nice. Uh, shugos. Going to try and do a religion, check to differentiate the fumiyoshi. Graffiti from the actual original Desmond like decals here, and then he's going to start up using press the digitation to try and clean off the the bad stuff.

22:40

Huh, let's see.

22:52

I'm gonna go kind of watches what you're doing for a minute and then does the same.

23:03

I didn't know that spell could do that.

23:09

Uh it says it came clean or soil. You go. I i gm know, this felt new the spell could do that. I'll make. Oh, okay, okay. Sorry.

23:26

She's only been a sorcerer for a month.

23:34

Really comes in handy, when you don't have a straighten your body to clean your things in it.

23:45

Yeah, after struggle gets all that cleaned up. Uh, you will proceed back out, shutting the door behind him.

23:58

Um, yeah, yeah, sure. The bodies themselves are all going to be fumiyoshi. There's not going to be any stuff to take in here. That wouldn't be great. Robbie. No no the body themselves are all like destiny. That's what i mean they were. In fact, this was a terrible desecration of a design in place with might be a reason.

24:26

She was like go that way. Oh, she's gonna say a prayer over and all i saw down. There was um cut me holes and some funky art. Then sugar will do the same thing over here.

24:48

Trying to glean what he can information-wise from the the decals first though. In case there's like any sort of clues as to what the who may oceans wanted, what other than just desecrating graves. Hey us strife? Okay. Yeah, that's what they wanted. So, by designating, the the grave of loyal desmond worshipers, they got temple of those.

25:39

Us wardens. Did they leave like intact corpses?

25:46

I can't do ya. Thursday night, inquirrel. Then we should probably return those to their breasting places as well. Oh, she will help do that.

26:03

Always spends the time basically poking at this anti-life shell. Just tap tap set up set that maybe you can refresh actually convenience at this area that we entered from over here. What was this big symbol on the ground. Desna this one. Uh, the red circle area that we came from.

26:33

Oh no. That that's just map decoration, you, you walked through the the statue of design into a natural cave system that led to the necropolis. Got you. That is just a map that they put on all the. I think they put on all with jade regent maps which is one of the reasons i wanted to use their maps if i could, because they are beautiful.

26:59

But i actually think i have a much better program now for extracting images out of a pdf, After shot that was done, he will close the door behind him, and come on back outside. Um, what you don't fall off the clothes.

27:20

So, let's talk now you guys didn't see anything. When you were down at the bottom of the ravine here, a lot of bone, a lot of bones. I think our only recourse is to just jump. Nope, we make it. Yeah. Oh, she's gonna jump it struggle. Well, as well.

27:46

Since the p fails. It won't hurt him, too bad. Actually let me read up on acrobatics again before i say that. I mean, if you don't want to wait, oh, that's about that. I seem to i seem to remember being told when we identified this this, that it could be well like it's impressible thing.

28:08

Yeah, that's a whatever. Yeah, you can suppress it for an hour with the cell magic, uh, and then would that be enough for us to then get the caravan through, or we go to the end and then come back and suppress it again, or by. Then it'll be gone.

28:26

I'm talk before, i think. Let's suppress it and move past it if you can. Yeah, i coyote does not have the spell magic prepared but she could repair it tomorrow. And it is an anti-life shell so it's not like anything is going to come from that side unless they're undead.

28:54

Uh, and it's not, it's not a symbol right? What an actual anti-life spell. It's an actual anti-life spell. Yeah so it's it's not that's good. Yeah, no no no. You can dismantle those but

29:15

Yeah, no. When i read it, that it could just be suppressed. And,

29:28

Uh, don't suppose, you could just uh ask the lady. Does not let us through here. This is not business. Doing me. Great. This again. Right. Anyone permanent intellectual castle, 13, blocking the bridge. Successful. Dispel magic suppresses the anti-light for one hour after which it reappears.

30:12

They don't actually give me a way to get rid of it, but it's also

30:20

Because there is no listed way to get rid of it in the spell itself. So prominent spells generally speaking. Um you can temporarily suppress stuff. Um how long the suppression lasts fall varies by spell? Ah, i would expect that would be something with somewhere. That's how long it takes for it to be suppressed.

30:44

Uh, the books isn't an hour. Oh there you go. So the spell magic on it. It's pressed for an hour. Yeah. Okay, we're on the same page. I mean, what we'll do, if we didn't have someone with the spell magic cry. So koya, walks up to this anti-life show and she says, i have no memory of how to dispel this.

31:09

So, you said, for a while for you primary spellcaster to prepare a spell. This is why you always keep one of your highest level slots available, prep cast and then throws a rock into the quails and a bunch of tentacles. Come out there. Wait.

31:35

Wait, wait to complete my joke after she dispels. It for some reason. She says, when in doubt always follow your nose.

31:50

Um, it's not okay. So quiet says, if we wait until tomorrow, i can dispel it. And then i remembered that omega is a sorcerer five foot steps. Gives us about do something. Yeah, she just sort of like looks at her hand and points at the shelf.

32:29

Really, it's a it's a skill. Check? Can i inspire competency browns? A little bit is pasta. Levels are a skill check? Yeah, i did not know that. Yes, feel free. Boom. Wins a little harder at it.

33:03

Just get angry out at your highness.

33:10

And then the empty life shell kind of vibrates and collapses.

33:21

Well done lady, amigo. Thank you. Sorry, gonna take a look at it for a second and then you're gonna walk across the anger is not how i work. No way. Psych, there's a wall. Oh yeah. I actually put a wall there to prevent you from. It's like wondering through the symbol.

33:45

Okay, so since i'm seeing letters here, i'm assuming this gap isn't meant to be here, right? Yeah, we can not much you could see like what looks like a splatter or a spray after. There's a gap in the walls so we can see. We get two squares worth of that room.

34:06

I don't think that's a room. I think that's like the label. It is off the map. Yeah, like i see an s so i'm assuming that's all letter. It's literally just says the tall. Necropolis. It's the title of the map.

34:28

Oh, that's about that. Looks shiny and shimmery. That means good things right in the necropolis, where the horrible things just experience is, probably not a strange pillar. Seeming almost a bare branch tree stands in the center of this arcing cavern. In the midst of a pool of still water a faint.

34:53

Violet. Radiance from beneath the pool lights, the cavern reflecting off of the ceiling above, like tiny stars beyond the stone tree, a pale-like glints. From one wall of the cave to the northwest of smooth, passage slopes upward.

35:14

That's the northeast is this the or is this? The passage that sleeps upward, this is the one that soups upward.

35:27

So, a pillar in a pool. Wonderful. Lay, i forgot to make this purple.

35:46

That's way too purple. There's also a body. Is that a body right there? Yes. Actually. It looks like.

36:00

There are two areas for descriptions. Here. A gilded door engraved with a demonic test faith. Go face stands in the wall, much of the guilt on its outer. Surface has been scraped off without a flickering light gleams from the edges of the door and a withered corpse lies before the door.

36:23

That would be this body here, sugar bends down to observe the corpse.

36:32

The door. I don't know that it's super matters. I don't particularly want to stand in the blowing water but it's all so very white in here that i can't really make some of that stuff out. It is very, very white.

36:50

Uh, let me but the tree roughly is

36:57

And that's face. And then the pool is oh oh that is yoko. Yeah, shell goes contributing heavily, i believe.

37:11

We're gonna we're gonna dim you a bit. Oh yeah. Sorry, i must have been the. That must have been the dancing lights. I cast earlier. No, that's from the radiance thing that we did when we were fighting the, uh, headless things. I believe koya did something. And i think, we maybe just stuck it on you.

37:33

I don't know or maybe you did something because you're good with undead.

37:42

Okay, that's the amount of bright. It should be in here. Now.

37:50

So pretty bright because light reflects off of ice. Oh yeah. And there is natural light, apparently coming out of the pool.

38:17

Well then.

38:21

As you move up to expect the body, it reaches out to grab you.

38:30

That is not very nice. I will take, i will take. Um,

38:47

And the twist body, the jerks into movement that is little more than skin and bones at this point.

38:58

Oh, religion checks, religion jokes.

39:06

About religion, but that lady needs a tailor.

39:12

That's what she's been in your entire time for grace and she's just been waiting for you. Yeah. Only you can set her spirits.

39:41

Light, how many lights are there?

39:51

We are missing mr. Grayson and noise. So,

40:05

Oh yeah, sure. Sorry.

40:16

All right shooko. Now, we will finish.

40:27

Let's go will oh the night. Wait, one thing, i mean, okay, so she gets another plus four. So a 23 to grapple you. No, yeah, that'll do it.

40:53

District will happen on her next turn. Lunch, just the old damage. All right, who did knowledge religions? Just shoko, shoko, fantastic. That means you get to be appropriately. Scared of where you are right now. Uh, she's a revenant.

41:16

Uh, and she's gonna choke you to death. Right now. Yeah, she's she's gonna choke you to death. Uh, their reason a revidence existence is fueled by its hatred for its murderer, as long as the murderer exists, the revenant exists. If the murderer dies, the remnant is slain immediately, a murderer who becomes undead does not trigger a revenant destruction.

41:47

When a revenant encounters its murderer. It gains like benefits of a haste spell and that lasts. As long as it's murderer remains insight against its murder of the ribbon and also gains plus four brain bonus on attack rolls. Weapon damage rolls gravel checks and saving throws. You also know that if they are confronted with their reflection or any object that was important to it in life.

42:10

I revenant must make a will save to avoid becoming overwhelmed with self-pity this condition, renders them helpless, and last until the revenue is attacked or sees its murderer. If a revenant resists becoming overwhelmed their evident becomes obsessed with the source, that triggered the saving throw and does everything in Kansas destroy it.

42:31

Reacting to the trigger. As if it were, it's murderer and gaining better bonuses. For its reason. The hate ability since murderer of revenant knows the direction, but not the distance to its murderer. This sense can be blocked by any effect that blocks sprang against murder. Everyone, it has true seeing and discern lives and affected all times.

42:57

Hmm, i don't like that. Um, did i kill the thing? Would you said earlier it gets a plus 4 against me? So it's not going to that plus 4 was from. It's grapple. It gets a plus square to grapple check. Okay, okay. Well, so if it's choking me, does that mean i can't cast anything?

43:24

You are grappled. So, you love to make concentration, check?

43:30

You're both grappled by the way. Okay.

43:39

I will attempt said concentration. Check for a second level spell.

43:49

I fail.

43:56

Lovely. I believe that's my turn so and turn. And the spirit layer once again.

44:17

Um, so go chokes out mirror show itself.

44:26

You two to two or what, all right, okay, each round.

44:36

Okay.

44:42

Sorry. Beginning turn. All right, we're good.

44:50

Uh, did you actually use something? I tried to cast a spell and rolled a three on my concentration? Check, and then i'm gonna show, go chokes out, uh, for somebody to show it. It's reflection. Excellent. Boom. Um, echo.

45:16

Okay. Hi, as amico steps up near to help shoco bringing with her mirror. You see what appears to be two? Spectral forms. Stripped up out of the pool of water. Fuck me.

45:46

They will act next turn though.

45:55

Um, echo has a mirror.

46:04

Well clothing, pc 20 will save.

46:13

Of course, though. She doesn't break out. And since she successed on the same, she gets a bonus now for attacking the mirror. Boom, but that means she lets you go shugo

46:37

Oh, can i make a scale? Check to identify specters uh knowledge religiously use and then she makes a full attack to sunder i'll make it was mirror.

46:52

That mirror's gone. But at least she provoked, right? She does provoke. She didn't wait. Does he have a group thunder? She does that. Okay just improve grapple if we're elephant in the room then they're oh it's improves under. Not one of the ones.

47:10

It's, it's popped on the powerful or death maneuvers. I think it's powerful. Yeah, right. Oh, so she just gets deaf maneuvers. Then once you got a proof grapple have, she's not powerful powerful. She doesn't have this underwater. Okay. So, cheaper books. Wait. Not sweet.

47:41

Really, all right.

47:54

All right.

48:01

So do i get anything on my knowledge? Religion. Check for a specter ah 19. Yes. So, uh, specters, oh, create spawn, anyone slang by Specter becomes a specter themselves in. That's a hell of turnaround 1d4 rounds one. So, created are less powerful than typical specters though. And so, for minus two penalty on all d20, rolls in checks, resurrection vulnerability, race dead or similar spelled cast.

48:33

On inspector destroys, it will negates using this film. This way does not require a material component. Oh, sunlight. Powerlessness specters are normally powerless in natural sunlight. Not merely a daylight's film flea from it. Affect your cotton, sunlight cannot attack. And it's staggered unnatural aura animals, whether wild or gonna say can sense the unnatural presence of a secular distance 30 feet.

49:00

They will not willingly approach nearer than that and panic if force that you so

49:09

Uh, they are incorial though. They have turn resists or channel resistance.

49:20

No d r or anything like that, though. Just think for you and then trades.

49:31

Oh, and then it's inspector's certain Oh, look at third part.

49:43

I also should be able to sort of pointing out to their incorial touch has energy drain.

49:54

Uh i think i will be taking my reaction to it's super misses. Oh, never mind. No way.

50:09

Hate all of this.

50:14

And,

50:20

Time, it's fine. So do that. Thank you. Okay, give me. Give me my movement. Thank you. Hi. Oh, you just go out into the water. Uh, ninja. Yep.

50:41

Uh but these things look like ghosts. The last time i tried to deal with something that ghost like i had my weapon bomb stuff but i don't have that because i handed all of that all. So we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way and flying kick to the to the ball to.

51:00

I have so many things to

51:08

All right, roll person. Everyone can roll perception. That is in the room. I think ochi and coya are actually not in a good place to i'm a visual. No, you can't not from there. The disparity, it's a big difference when there's a whole wall right here,

51:35

No way. Good of course. No way. Grayson shoko. You also want to roll above a 30.

51:46

I may go doesn't see it. He is. He is focused. You see a Yeti crouched in the shadows of this tunnel, but yeti ninja. I knew it the each round of living creature, spently inside the spirit area. You know, the chance is doubled of a living creature touches, the tree or water.

52:26

Fool of a ninja.

52:34

Welcome banishing. Trick anything else movement? Flying kick to the back of its head that actually runs correctly. Oh, there it is. I'm sorry. I missed the kick completely with ghost edge. Actually, i, it does. So like half of its ectoplasm is just picked us under off of it and it shrinks in pain.

53:01

And then the moment like that that kick is finished. She just gone whaling with the torment of its damn soul.

53:18

Like family.

53:29

I know, man, she's a priestess of desmond.

53:46

It's a, it's a spirit barrier. The pool is a spirit barrier.

53:58

What does that mean? They can't leave it.

54:09

Son of a bitch.

54:16

You're gonna tell me how i gain uh like oh there's a lot of them. Okay. Anyway, it's not in your round yet. Never mind. Never mind. Never mind. I rolled that too early gracing, an OG self to go.

54:36

I think grace is going to spend his turn pulling out the, that's what the holy weapon bomb and applying it to 10 arrow.

54:53

Oh, that's okay. It's gonna do. She's gonna use her caravan bond to give you guys such a good. So, did Grayson yell out that there's a yeti over there or not? Grayson Shoco shelf. Couldn't see him. It's too sneaky for him. So only grace in and a mako have seen it like no aside too.

55:15

No. Yeah. You all thought Yeti. Okay, cool. A little yellow exclamation mark appears above the uni side. No way. Get get a touch of good for you next turn. Okay. Yay. Such a good where? Where is that one? I can't really see where the edge of the pool is that's on the outside of the pool, right?

55:44

It is. Yeah. Okay, i'm gonna turn off the, the shimmering lights since they. They're just, it's just a faint line in the first place. That's actually much better. You could stop there because i do appreciate the cool stuff. Oh, geez. Yeah, the slightly darker shade of blue gray is

56:15

I think oju's gonna stick with his first instinct, which i haven't measured out but what level is the touch of good. Uh,

56:36

Oh, she's gonna go there and do a stab.

56:46

Drawing is weapon as he did, of course, is this creature evil. So evil.

56:56

I am lay flank.

57:01

They don't does that work. In undead, undead. Traits sneak attack. I think that's what work fine. It's only incomporial things. Boom. Okay. You're fighting against the revenant.

57:29

So OG does a poke and then kind of readys himself or whatever the hell is about to happen in this crazy room. We are again awesome. Perfect. So you actually got quite deeply into that revenant.

57:51

Yeah, and that's going to be OT stern.

57:58

Bringing us in two shoco. Oh shoko will five foot step away from the scary specter.

58:19

Oh, it's the start of around. Does that mean the new spectra show up? Oh yeah, i forgot. Why do you have to say something? Nice. Uh,

58:41

Um should go. We'll call out the specters can't leave the barrier. Stay away from the pool. Uh, and then attempt to hit as many things as he can with some dread.

59:19

Okay, originate a cone on any part of my square, or does it have to be the center? It's a corner. Yeah. Oh it's a corner of my square. Perfect. And or a side.

59:40

I generally dislike corners like that but it is technically legal.

59:54

Uh, and i will make my percussion check. Oh, you're worse performance to date but still outstanding.

01:00:10

Uh yeah, everything in there is chicken. Oh boom. I lied. The revenant's not.

01:00:24

But the specters are all for one round.

01:00:33

Barely, they also have a 23 cmd. That's not saying beer. No. It's a and tonight. Yeah. My their intimidate dc which is the diamonds. Wisdom. Hit diapers like this, right? Okay. So suspecters, have eight hit dice. Wisdom 16. So 21, so they're shaken for one round.

01:01:08

The revenant has nine hit dice plus one taking for a round.

01:01:41

Well, played sir anything else for him? Uh, no, that'll be it. Uh, how much do i have to exceed the dc by to demolize for two rounds?

01:02:20

I'm just waiting for all of these things to have life site. Uh, they don't actually i i've looked already. I i legit. No. All right, my eyes. Let's do something really stupid. No, it just sort of floats there.

01:02:46

Doesn't go anywhere. They have no idea. You're there. Where the fuck did my car to go? Did you click off of your character? Yes. And very smart. Um, not a crate and the second attack, mrs.

01:03:07

The revenant.

01:03:18

Uh, to get anything on this, on my knowledge. Check. Uh, i don't think i've explained it to available streak. Yeah, once everyone before, browning can streak as a standard action, all creatures within a 60 foot, spread must make a DC 18 wheel, save or coward and fear for 1v4 rounds.

01:03:43

Oh no. Is the manuf mind effect for your bike little things. My favorite. But for some reason, i have it made as

01:04:02

Targeting.

01:04:07

They're cool. Thank goodness for a touch of good.

01:04:14

Oh, and i have plus four against beer anyways. Okay.

01:04:26

Did you get in touch? We go to the valium. Such a good. We all got a touch of good. No, only one person is such good. Oh, you coins that? Yeah. Okay. So who got it? Did you get? No. No, i did. Uh, well no, it was in the, in the middle of a murdering things.

01:04:47

Well, no. Well safe is 19. Anyways, because plus four, i like toys mindset noise out murdering things. She looks like. She could use a controlled shock to help with that as doesn't. It has no problems with murdering that.

01:05:06

All right, are you work now? There we go. Oh, i hate it.

01:05:37

Oh shit. All right, so no end clear will be cowering.

01:05:47

Or we'll take the one round that we got on the the second one.

01:05:58

Not amigo.

01:06:06

Actually.

01:06:11

A meco still has enough levels of paladin. She was, she's actually means appear. Anyways.

01:06:20

Powering that was a standard action.

01:06:40

Oh,

01:06:45

That wasn't very nice.

01:06:50

So, you see this kind of slip out the wall? Oh no. Oh no points of strength damage by the way.

01:07:06

Uh, and then the revenant immediately screams in fury at the shadow.

01:07:20

And a good look with that. Yeah, there's literally nothing. The revenue can do against the shadow but the shadow is its murderer.

01:07:34

Back there. No way. Oh cowering, you're cowering. Yeah, i'm sorry. Oh yes. Cowarding. Grayson recent, please murder. This. I cannot stress how bad this is. Yeah. He'll use five of those arrows. He just put these podolia on, meanwhile spike being carry knowing the best of her just going high.

01:08:04

Yes, our damage coming out. Helping. And also makes me good align. So that doesn't actually help ghost touch but you still good sick. I mean it makes me first the holy weapon bomb. Yep. It doesn't make them good aligned, it makes them ghost. Touch. You just gain an additional two-day flow damage against evil outsiders, and i'm dead.

01:08:49

That's what we'll save i needed to make also, right?

01:09:01

Of course. Okay, so it's not. It doesn't give the holy property at all like no i thought it did for some reason i know it would make sense to do that but it it's it's closer to like a ghost salt blaunch but it has extra damage attached to it.

01:09:20

All right. So, boom. You ignore it's partial cover. So that 19 hits uh the 15 misses that 19 hits. And destroy the shadow shoku, your wish is my command. So your fourth and key arrow can go elsewhere. Oh, she dies immediately by the way. I guess what? The factors just to not waste the extra damage from it.

01:10:03

Well that one was already half missing. So you hit it and then shoot another specter.

01:10:15

You can just keep putting undead to rest. Yo guys, fucking triple kill over here. All right. Anything else for you? Grayson. So is anybody uh anybody know why there's a yeti crouch over there? Is it like it's just weird? Yeah, sorry home. Dude's gonna run at the, the end of this round brokers got clutching his chest and clearly like not having good days.

01:10:46

Oh, what are you talking?

01:10:58

Oh, she gonna run up to him. Here is difficult terrain. What does that? Add fancy. So it costs two to go through that one. Great. Then i still have the movement. Excellent.

01:11:22

We are attacking me any though.

01:11:28

Boom. All right. He is not going to be flat-footed.

01:11:40

Which also means,

01:11:48

He skewers you as you running him.

01:11:53

What if i just did spring attack when i did that instead.

01:12:00

I mean, i say take, you come upons for attacking a Yeti who wasn't attacking you. All right, i took the damage.

01:12:13

That's okay. Soul turn.

01:12:19

She'll go. Uh, we had established that these were like cannibal yetis right? No jetties are normally neutral. Something has gone wrong with this group. They're not usually evil, but i don't think anyone explained that nuance to show to you.

01:12:52

For did you have? Were you know what? The nose local? No. Last week's a jumble, my knowledge locals, like two or something. Ridiculous. Oh, i have three rings in it.

01:13:16

Critical will go up here and target. This yeti because well, yes they are normally neutral. The ones in this case, have all tried to kill us and he just saw this one try to skew her. Oh, she so That he defended himself you guys are skewing this.

01:13:43

Um i mean just saying i mean, when a party member swings on someone, it's kind of, like, okay, do we all want to fight each other over this or do we want to act as a group and not all die?

01:13:59

So, ride or die. Without you. I'm gonna hit this yeti with this mortal tear.

01:14:21

Of course.

01:14:25

There are the skirt.

01:14:31

No way. In the end of circles time, inspector doesn't know what to do with his life. And so just sort of presses against a barrier. That is not there for you guys. Can you kissing? He's not five foot stepping though. No way. Because i'm coworking and baffle can't. It's a new round.

01:14:59

You round and the revenant sound. Yeah. But it hasn't been my round yet. So i'm powering for a full round. I should be cowering too. Yeah, you should. Yeah. I failed the hell out of that. We'll say, oh, okay. I just assumed that the cower effect went away when the revenant died.

01:15:23

It's because it's a supernatural thing. It's not like it's going. I'm not going to do anything. I'm not, i'm not gonna argue with anything. I'm just like, It's a typical rules. It's not like it wasn't supernatural effect. So this is actually a good thing. Yeah, we're gonna just unochie that and everyone's gonna get their health back.

01:15:53

Not that. I want to be the the party's propaganda. That's not really what i'm doing. I'm just i'm scaring for both bound. Nope. Nope. It's good.

01:16:12

All right, so he was waiting for combat to end.

01:16:20

And he says something in tiong.

01:16:40

Um, Circle will, uh, look at him and responded to you on. Um,

01:16:53

Are you with the yetis who attacked us out there? My phone is outside kind of it's like, looks down this tunnel like he's making sure no one's listening or something. A trundles down the slopes like a snow gorilla. I know what they are. I'm sorry. It's okay, be right?

01:17:18

I'm trying to take the transcript and i said it up bacon. Take a transcript of the game if you're texting me. I don't know about it.

01:17:30

Trucker will translate for anyone who doesn't speak Tian which i don't think is anyone in this group? All right. Grayson doesn't speak at all. Oh, okay. Tian. Yeah. Uh yeah. I speak it. Just quiet. Speak to you on. I think the actual language is tn. Tiana is the ethnicity.

01:17:57

That's true. It is tien. Uh, she does. Okay. Well uh i guess uh shuncle will rely on koya to translate for grace so he does not shoot our new friend. Oh i'm relay. What the the yeti said as soon as he says it.

01:18:21

All right, well, if we're not doing combats, there's just a bunch of creepy ghosts in this pool. Yeah, gonna do they like there's more deep coming out of it. I they will keep coming out as long as no way is inside the sphere barrier, but they cannot see her.

01:18:42

They're just very confused. Yeah. So it really depends on if no way is going to leave the spirit barrier on her turn. So i guess that's the question. No, absolutely not unlimited XP farm. And i'm just no after getting hit with that cowering thing. She like backs. The the fuck up to this wall?

01:19:07

You, you see like a in the in the snow when the game wants me to wait, i can't of course i can't combat never mind. Yeah, okay, so we're just gonna end this in so you everyone can go back to free movement. You guys can see like the the the snow kind of skid back to this wall and doesn't outline of knowing the wall.

01:19:34

Just, i didn't like that.

01:19:43

Yeah, sorry, it took us that long ago, say anything.

01:19:56

We're not comes out and visibility like,

01:20:08

Question mark, like looks at a like a mika or grace and just like not killing that. Okay. He said friend help. Right? He did. And then said something about his chief being possessed by an evil spirit and the specter is slowly drifts back into the pool of water.

01:20:36

Logo puts his weapon away. Uh i'll see if my sword and OG will take some functions. Spaghetti, they knew exactly what they were doing when they made that pool. And i would not let you endless ex keep far.

01:20:54

He stops about here. It looks up at the big guy. Um, uh, i'm shoko. Do you have a name? Kind of frowns. Fox say, do you say soy, shoko?

01:21:19

Stuck just looks at ochy. Weird translating for you. Do you speak Tiana? Do do we figure that out? Yes. Yes, i'm speaking in tea on, right? Okay. Yeah, yeah. You, you should should be.

01:21:39

Last night out on the hunt.

01:21:46

I saw him speaking with.

01:21:54

Terrible spirit.

01:22:03

And then they become as one.

01:22:12

And he like, bolds his hands together, like trying to explain it to you like he doesn't really understand what happens.

01:22:25

Can you tell me what this spirit looked like?

01:22:31

I need round the ear woman, but blue with wings.

01:22:44

Oh, this lady is just not gonna leave us alone, is she? We know her. He like, readys himself and like points to the spirit. Not friend. Not sure. You not friend. Okay. He like visibly comes down.

01:23:08

We kill her, and her ghost haunt us ever since. Sorry that it seems to hurt you. All tribe. Try kill you.

01:23:28

Coco nods. Can you tell us where your chief is now? So we can try to destroy this spirit. He points down this hallway and then down this hallway, both take you there one way though. You kill my tribe. Another way. Powerful magic.

01:24:01

Tougher looks to the rest of you. Well, you heard him if we deal with whatever this powerful magic is, we might be able to save the rest of this tribe. Maybe her control over them will go away. Once we dispatch her.

01:24:28

What is everyone think? Which way is magic. He points to the the carved out tunnel.

01:24:47

I think we need to get rid of this lady or she's just going to keep following us and messing with the care man.

01:24:59

Uh, yep. What my question was. Do we want to fight through all the rest of the tribe? Or do we want to deal with whatever this magic is? Because but of one of the two stains in our way to her, I mean, you get the impression that you prefer you not murder his tribe.

01:25:22

Oh yeah. Show goes. But he doesn't speak common. My vote is, i think pretty obvious that we don't murder a bunch of, oh, possessed creatures and we try and resolve this with his little legit as possible. But i'm not the one in charge here and he looks too. I'll make up.

01:25:47

I mean, i don't see a reason for us to murder a bunch of beings if we can avoid it. Could be more dangerous.

01:26:01

Clear. Anything stopping us from at least looking at this powerful magic. See if we can even do anything about it. Nothing at all. I don't think soco turns back to the yeti and says, we'll go down the this way and see what we can do. Um, we'll try our best not to hurt the rest of your people.

01:26:28

Thank you, soco jobs. Have one question though. He points. Uh, well actually no, he has two questions. He points at the body. First. He says, you know, who that no gonna long time we stay away from this chamber. So you don't know what's behind that door. No point to the one with the face on it.

01:26:56

No.

01:27:02

Coconut.

01:27:09

The revenue does have gear on them. By the way, is that door locked? Oh, it is not locked. Sugar will continue conversing with the yeti. While you guys are got like, he'll ask, how did you learn to speak this referring to tn monks?

01:27:32

To come to the mountains.

01:27:39

I mean he's got an intelligence of seven so he's not the brightest of apples but they have a wisdoms of 14. Though, they live very simple lives. Usually,

01:27:57

At least they do on this side of the world.

01:28:04

Far. As abstain's concerned. Yeah, these are awful terrible people.

01:28:15

But did they start out that way?

01:28:19

I was kind of inclined to say yes considering the app low.

01:28:28

Yeah, there's not actually a reason for them to only speak at low. They are humanoids. Their monsters humanoids but they're still humanoids, not aberrations.

01:28:48

Would you expected the first one? I would have expected, would have been on in a giant ken like a like to ogres and trolls, etc. Yeah, you think

01:29:03

OT opens this door.

01:29:10

Uh, all right, we're gonna go on that door. It also helps that the the monastery of casein on this side of the world is a monastery of yetis.

01:29:25

You have to understand that asian yetis are very different from european yet.

01:29:35

Or maybe they're all the same and it just depends on where they are. Cultural differences. Yeah, we wait folk like to to rate everything about how how quickly we can fight and kill it.

01:29:51

30 steps through the cool door. The demon face store. Yeah, it's very excuse me.

01:30:04

Flickering fire light illuminates. This octagonal room. Read demonic faces leer from the walls against the painted background of midnight, blue and the center of this room seemingly almost to swim in the sea of night. A beer of blue painted stone bears. Emotionless skeleton is faced. It's face concealed beneath the golden mask.

01:30:31

By the way, a shark was gonna had done decora. And um, uh koya. I feel about 30 years old or like, i'm about to kill over any second. Do you have anything for this shadow, right? Yes, circle is currently at three strength. I mean, it's i really such a difference.

01:30:59

Heckles and takes three rounds together. What do you mean liking charges? I can only imagine that. You're so over encumbered at this point that you were like

01:31:20

His shoulders do appear to be dragging solo, but they they look like they're about to come out of their sockets.

01:31:31

And he is slightly out of breath. By the time he speaks to coya. Can i look a little bit harder at this thing or roll a relevant knowledge? Yeah, i'm just trying to get this rolled. Yeah, i mean what graceful no lean into no way be like hey no wait by the way once again this uh holy weapon stuff.

01:31:51

Super great, uh, when i run now, it's i'll make sure to buy some more materials for you. Hi bean.

01:32:01

So, the room is lit. Yes, never mind. Yeah. She's nodding but like the room is lit by continual flame inside a crystal lamp, that appears to be worth quite a bit of money and the court seems to be wearing a beautiful set of armor with gorgeous sword. Embossed with the symbol of desna on it.

01:32:34

Uh, in addition, the corpse is also wearing eight matching bracelets, eight matching rings and a golden mask with eyes of jade. Um, what are you making this showcode? Can i get a skill to identify like, who? I think this might have been with a significance of these. Items are or the paintings or anything like that.

01:32:58

I this was obvious. Yeah, this was obviously, the high priestess of fumiyoshi who ended up becoming a shadow. Uh, you have enough knowledge religion that even glancing around the mirror. This, there was a full ritual here in her tomb to become undead.

01:33:20

We did this on purpose. All right. No regrets then and show. No, no, no. Oh. Uh, this beautiful armor consists of four polished steel plates. Harnessed together with leather shoulder straps, do round plates protects the wearers, front and back. While two smaller, rectangular plates cover, the sides of the torso, the sword on the other hand is crafted of silvery gray steel with nine golden rings threaded through its spine, that glow with magical power, streamers of blue and purple.

01:33:58

Silk, hang from the sword's pummel. Why is that a temple sword? I see that is a temple sword. You see i didn't think temple sword, but it is temple sword.

01:34:15

On that side of the world. Now, alcohol will. Um, oh well, first of all things like. Um, it does not gonna mind if we rob this grave, right? Because this is like that sword, did not belong to that preseason Yoshi. She likely killed, okay? From the priests of the priestess of death.

01:34:38

Not. That was protecting those necropolis or she pillage it from one of their graves. Uh, okay, shuttle will pick up that sword, but he has smoke weapon proficiency. Uh, that is a nine-fold spirit sword, sir.

01:34:57

My hearings specific weapon. You are. In fact, the armor that she is wearing is the ghost mirror armor.

01:35:12

You can just copy and paste the list because there's what in here actually. So well, we'll know. I continues having like a momentary heart attack. Oh yeah. Um, my understanding correctly that we have come across the, the items of a Desmond Ghostbuster. Yes. Actually, that is exactly what you call spirit shamans.

01:35:39

Are that is extremely funny to me. I just want just want people to know that. I find that extremely funny. Oh, i need to get agile on this fucking thing. Just here in the wall, this is going to be great. Uh, so and the other one is the ghost.

01:36:03

Mirror armor. You can do there is so much treasured here. All right, and i will score.

01:36:32

I am a bar, though. Some medium armor isn't really my thing. There's no one here who's into armor really at all.

01:36:45

You're the heaviest armored person here.

01:36:55

In the party. It's true. Yep.

01:37:01

Everybody else is walking around in Hawaiian shirts or tracksuits, and you're wearing like, leather armor or whatever armor you've been wearing.

01:37:12

Uh, yeah. No, i've just got light armor and shield professionally, but yeah, i've been wearing a mythical shirt the entire time

01:37:41

I need the base. That's for four mirror. What i'm doing a and you see,

01:38:19

I mean, yeah, i guess no one can really use that.

01:38:30

What about coya or our makeup? Uh, koya actually. Lost some armor preciency. Let me, i think it was just heavy armor that will let you

01:38:49

Nope, her caravan von she only gets profession. See with light armor. If anyone in the who on the caravan, there's medium armor, uh, sandra can wear medium armor, kelda words, heavy armor. Is not dexterous one of those.

01:39:18

Um, well, i guess it's a, it's a big old pile of money then. I mean, it is a high ticket item. Most definitely though your sword is, is definitely the highest

01:39:52

We're gonna take our break right here because i need more tea and there's a lot of loots. We throw up the ready, bones. All i would like to use this sword right now. I need to find somebody to enchant it with agile before i like actually start doing damage with it.

01:40:13

So, like maybe he would be better in one of your hands for now. Unless you think like you like your weapons better looks at no way would likely be able to use it.

01:40:35

Ninja does not get mine questions presidency.

01:40:42

Yeah. And i gave up my all swords proficiency as a tangu for my cool sticks that i carry around on my sleeves. And i don't believe i get monk weapon weapon proficiency from anywhere.

01:41:02

So, no, you're kind of the only one that can really use corsair, i guess i'm going on.

01:41:16

Um, yeah. Even though i have a month weapon for Christmas, i don't think i can actually use the story.

01:41:28

Yeah, because you can't blurry with melee weapons anymore, right? Perfect.

01:41:36

Yeah, so that's that's all you guys, okay? I'll be back break time.

01:41:50

Oh, you guys have thoroughly looted. This crypt of a servant of pumiyoshi. Uh, hello. I have returned him back, um, so i was looking at the ninfolks here at sword. And uh, i uh, i misread something. Um, it is not, in fact, a chapter sword. It is a nine rain broad sword, which means it is a heavy one-handed weapon which means i cannot use it with weaponess until i get a people face.

01:42:24

Brick. Uh i i have five strength. So i probably will not be using it in the near future. It is also a marshal monk weapon. Not a exotic one. So oh, she and no way probably can use it. Definitely not the case of pain, but still can't.

01:42:49

You two. Don't have martial. Pepper. Oh, marshall weapon. Proficiency covers it then. Yeah. I i do, i would imagine

01:43:13

I mean mochi. Also, just got his cool sword from someone else. Yeah, i'm kind of, i don't want to be a sword slit, you know what i mean? Okay, uh i guess uh, i could use this to use its activated abilities, whatever so much they are yes.

01:43:39

And congratulations. You guys have successfully found every named item in this particular. AP, radical not ap. Sorry just book this book. Okay, okay. It really generic but no the the further you get into tea on the more unique. It's many of the weapons are going to get come along friends.

01:44:10

So dying that the spirit pulling and see you.

01:44:31

Something goes back this way.

01:44:38

Fully expecting a giant boulder of some kind to come down. This surprisingly, long, passageway, and flattening. It me breed area, nine to you except that justice. All i thought that was just. So here's the bowl.

01:45:02

Where are you? Airline you find the lower catacombs numerous small side passages branch off from the main corridor, which slopes upward to the west hundreds of braille niches have been carved into the rock walls of these catacombs. The dead of uktal are insurd in these crips exploring them. You find plenty of bones, but no skulls which, you know, the cult of fumiyoshi would have stolen for their grizzly displays.

01:45:32

You may also if you so choose, rob the dead. Again, i do not like this place, you know what? She's gonna go down this left hallway. That's not rob, definitely corpses.

01:45:52

By the way, can i get a whack with a care light if anyone's got a spare?

01:46:01

Foreign.

01:46:08

Carolina is right there.

01:46:16

Very much.

01:46:20

What is happening? Hi, grayson.

01:46:29

Freaking bitch back. Oh okay, okay, where are you? Where'd you go? You know, we are in the darkness.

01:46:46

Okay. Okay. Stand still stand. Still stupid bird. Uh, where is it?

01:47:00

Whack. We're gonna want that. I'm full make her get sucked into the stone while on your watch. Oh, mage armor. Let go. I noticed you staying near her. Yeah, we're not doing this again. It is hilarious because the last time you guys left without her, she was i am away we leave.

01:47:28

I may go behind with no way and like the moment. No, like glances away like uh, like like the wall opens scooby doo style and someone steals her. What caster level is a wand of major armor. It'll be one unless you specifically buy it at a higher level, caster level.

01:48:07

We can't see where everyone is. This is, um, okay. Hold on, hold on. Hold on. Everybody. Everybody calm down. Get back together. We need to like put our hands in each other's pockets and staying like a train formation here. Well, you didn't want to scooby do it and nobody fill out in the main corridor.

01:48:35

Is there a wall at the end of this? There is no, okay.

01:48:45

We'll scream about it a little deep in. I can pull that back a little bit. I don't find anything of interest in these catacombs. You can grape rub if you want.

01:49:04

It is an option but it's what you'll be doing. If you're looking for something interesting. Oh stuff. Stuff alert. Hey, you guys

01:49:30

Oh, geez is going to cast commune with foxes and tell. Shoko to get up here.

01:49:36

Oh, this anti-life shell is very different from the previous one. This one looks like it's made of violent angry energy and is emanating from a pair of statues. The passage continues to slope upward here, flanked, by more catacombs. Cut into the rocks. And on each side of the passage of the walls of the passage a huge red demonic face, with short tusk is carved into the stone.

01:50:12

Um well i guess we make some our contracts to try and figure out what we're looking at here like where i put those uh markers like to Which also incidentally means that the thing that it is bound to you do. You can actually destroy.

01:50:35

Crazy but we can't just dispel magic suppress. This one, grayson kick him, you can, but to get rid of the other one you would have had to show the bridge. I don't think i can get to them to kick him. No, maybe i could shoot him i but that will work.

01:50:52

I guess why don't you destroy shooting them? He prepares the arrows in his phone. He's like, is there any reason? Anyone can think of that, i shouldn't do this and OG tickles his armpit so that the arrows fly aside from the fact that it's gonna take you, a lot of arrows to do it.

01:51:18

You'll be shooting in the stone.

01:51:22

I mean this is grace and we're talking about here, they have a hardness ten and 188 tree. Also all of his arrows, even the unlimited imaginary arrows, get back, all right, checking out the side passages maybe there's just a way around.

01:51:49

Cocoa's hesitant to go left. Go right? Because he knows that in that general direction is where the yeti clan is.

01:52:04

Og whistles and birdsong like the intro of snow white as he walks through these really creepy catacombs.

01:52:19

I don't think commune with birds will help us hear. Okay. Yes, i know day you're there. Ryland, let me tell your mom.

01:52:41

Uh yeah. A mako cats heard. This film magic which was, it is no longer on her spell list. I really like the the breaking glass effect on that net one. I like it a lot better than the like the over the top effects that we've been having.

01:53:08

It's still getting. I'm just gonna turn that off. I. Yeah. And as she transfers the spell of the magic, the darker magic of the priestess of fumiyoshi. Kind of ravages her. Let me go. Looks a little tired. I think i can do that one one more time, guys. What do you think?

01:53:35

Let's let's look around to see if there's another way through first. If we can get to the other side of those right faces, we might be able to turn them off. Somehow great thing. You find a very thin cavern wall.

01:53:56

Seems to be a partially dugout tunnel that you would have to make an escape artist to squeeze through. He will go back to the group and let him know he might have found something. So if it will get us around, he doesn't know. But at least it's something different than just catacombs.

01:54:17

This way. I found grayson.

01:54:38

There's an acrobatics to get through escape. Our team artist who's, who's good at that we all are i think?

01:54:57

I'm fairly small i could fit through there, i think.

01:55:05

Og says being the smallest person here except for maybe gracing, how tall is Grayson?

01:55:14

The Grayson is, i think thicker than OG. Yeah, i got some height on you, but i'm 100 pounds. You, tell me your people from there. He can well used to be able to when i was a kid.

01:55:46

I guess i'll roll the escape artists because i don't know what is happening over here. Actually, your skateboard is it's que as light coming through the dig out. Oh perfect, that'll do it.

01:56:05

And you hear what sounds like a yeti roar. This little bit funny. So, All right. Maybe we should back up. Oh, she's gonna tell like you guys hear the roar but he says, i don't see anything actually never mind.

01:56:33

Maybe we don't see a yeti. Come around the corner. Oh, i do. I don't think something really funny to me about how the tokens appeared like cool. I don't think we should go this way.

01:56:53

Do more harm than good and then you see a yeti arm stick. It's way into the dugout start grasping around and it's like they can't fit through the tunnel. Yeah, they cannot. So where are the statues? Could we strike them from the sides here? As opposed to the front like before over here, heck

01:57:27

Well let's look around the best we can see if we're missing anything. Yeah. Can we do a perception through these catacombs? You can it's not going to get you anything, okay? They are just catacombs, well, maybe we should have a Mako try. One more time to suppress it. All right.

01:57:50

Uh oh. We'll come down here with the mako and inspire competence on her attempts. They really said you better bring a mage. Oh, yeah, could do it as well. So, a full caster of some kind is usually expected in a party and we established that i was very wrong.

01:58:15

When it comes to things, they're not considered straight up skill checks. That was something that was in 3.5. Yes. Oh, they are considered sculpture. Oh yeah. This is not. Considering a skill change. Yeah. Change in. Pathfinder temerita, an entirely separate classification of things. They're not skilled checks. They're not ability checks, they're not.

01:58:36

But thank you, yoko and koya could bolt assist with their caster levels family. I'll give you the benefits teamwork. Beat that you don't have right now. We don't need it. She rolled really low.

01:59:01

That's it. I can't do it again. Maybe if you guys want to wait for me to shoot this thing, a bunch. That might be some uh yeti slaughter on the menu. We can always rest and come back tomorrow.

01:59:25

Ie get our spells back and try again or kinkoya. Try it. Not till tomorrow. Yeah. Was there anything ever prepared? Was there anything down this way? He's we didn't did. He and said we we wouldn't find anything. No, they're they're just catacombs and the only loot you're getting from them.

01:59:45

Is you feel great Rob?

01:59:56

Yeah, well not take kindly to you great, rubbing Desmond's? Yeah, we might end up resting between these two areas here on the catacombs because the other one's only suppressed for an hour and we'd end up using uses to do that again. Go over here again. Yeah, focus crashes of this chin.

02:00:19

Um, this crypt would actually be quite a bit of easily fortified little camping area down here. Yeah, let's go pack. Everybody into the place where somebody turned themselves into a shadow and sleep fan, you guys could clean it up. He got prestigation. All right. Oh, she's gonna bust out his folding chair.

02:00:40

He's had since level three and pull out some card games. Um, show goes going to uh, take the the lord of the ring joke, to its conclusion. And like say like well surely whoever made this head to have a way through it right? We lord of the rings. References, someone played drums the yetis know you're here.

02:01:07

That's true. I completely forgot about that.

02:01:15

Damn it. They are coming. I am being particularly cautious for her prison. I have entirely expecting a wall of yucky to appear the cast wall of them. All of yadi but luckily not all of the Yeti will come. So should be, that's i mean we've already established that they can't get into the catacombs, so maybe we could just hold up.

02:01:54

No, no, they can't get into the catacombs from that cave. They can get through from the other direction. Where the, uh, our tion speaking friend was which incidentally, actually, we're gonna say that. Yeti that saw that light is with the group that goes out to investigate and clears your path to go through that direction if you want to press on what

02:02:31

You could. You can sneak through the yeti caves from that direction. Oh, we could delete. Yeah, i guess we could try and stealth through them. I see a purple square for some reason, i was just scrolling back up to where the okay was? That because i like an animation thing.

02:02:47

Oh no, this needs to be deleted. Okay. So, well before we all go packing on that room again. I guess. We'll have that at that possibility of the discussion we could go rest in the room. We heard the yetis roar. They know we're here. We could always try and circumvent this magic spot and sneak through the yeti camp.

02:03:06

Try not to kill them. Sleep or stealth magic or stealth? Which you may want to fold up that chair and come out here and help me. Oh yeah yeah. Oh no. You guys are having this discussion. Still up there. Oh okay. Yeah, i completely forgot that the yetis were summoned by the drums so i have to adjust the map slightly.

02:03:32

You guys are up here once the yetis work of their courage to come into this room, seeing all the undead that they were terrified of being dead and investigate. So they'll probably show up as we're having that discussion because the drums were played a while ago, no way, they had to get their band together.

02:03:56

No way. How long can you stay invisible?

02:04:04

Relatively speaker or executively consecutively because i was thinking that since you can do things on scene that maybe you could sneak past the yetis down there and maybe cause a distraction on the other side but it's more time.

02:04:28

Begins counting on our hands like

02:04:36

I think i can probably keep it up for about 10 more minutes today. Happening. We do also have one potion of invisibility 13 minutes today, gay men's.

02:04:57

Well, i'm not gonna tell you to do it, but yeah, if you think you can handle it it would be very appreciated.

02:05:10

So, what are we gonna say? As far as do we know yet, either coming for us. We saw the arm through the tiny hole. We heard the yeti roar, but we don't know that they're coming for us from another room, right? No, you you do. This is harolding back to last game when the drum sounded through the caves got you, okay.

02:05:31

The yeti tribe was alerted to people being in here so they were gathering up their hunting party and we'll say that the guy who made the deal with you, slowed them down and you guys got out of that room before the yetis arrived in there. Okay, so what they're not coming.

02:05:49

You're gonna save his tribe. They think they're working up their courage to come up here in the catacombs, right? Yes, they are definitely scared of the undead. They broke into the necropolis accident, they delved too greedily and too deep they get in fact that is in fact exactly what happened.

02:06:15

Well then i know what illusions to go with to scare them if they try and get closer. How long can you do illusions for? It's just minor it uh silent image. So,

02:06:35

Oh, it's a concentration so i can keep it up forever. Okay. So, oh, geez, no strategist. I don't know if there's a high intelligence character or a medium intelligence character among us, but if they try and come up here, we could see if no a would like to stealth up past the yeti camp and see if she can circumvent and break these statues somehow from the far side.

02:07:00

And if the yetis come for us, we can

02:07:06

All pile up in that area and put illusions of undead at those two spots in the yetis, cannot get to us. And they don't have to kill them. I know. That's a lot of effort to not kill some yetis but is it complete pitch? Dark down here, yep.

02:07:33

Wonder how so the okay?

02:07:49

Uh, yeah, i'd have to, i'd have to have light to cast, silent image on them and oh, wait, i could do that with

02:08:00

What, what is it dancing lights? Yeah, they know. We're here. You can have the light and they could see us but just be too afraid to go past the undead. You could just put two figments of. This is the undead that they were scared of. That was in that room.

02:08:17

And i could make four glowing spheres of light, which resemble willow whisps. And then i can enhance the illusion with silent image to make it look like those specters are raising out of the ground like around here ish because i know that's where they're coming from and maybe that'll spook them from coming down this direction.

02:08:34

Yeah this is all contingent on. If no way is down to go, stealth pass.

02:08:42

Well, we might not need her to do that if we can scare them sufficiently from coming this way. Oh, you would just do it indefinitely instead of resting? What i think ochi is playing also involves stopping the yetis from coming to us but also involves no way going and trying to find a way to get.

02:09:03

Yeah because maybe i'm missing something here but we can't go back because we're going to kill the eddies and we can't go forward because these is the anti-life shell. But but there's a way forward now. Yes or where she wants, no way to scout before you guys follow. All right, you're talking about the same plan, you're just missing each other's points.

02:09:24

Oh okay. I thought you were talking about sending. No way back through to distract the eddies. Like i'd suggested earlier.

02:09:41

Tell me if we all just want to file through, i don't know that we can all be selfie or if all the yetis are cleared out.

02:09:55

You have to go through and find out.

02:10:02

Um, why not have a shoko? Make that undead spirit thing in front of us and so as it goes into a new room, the they'll all run away from that room and then we can move into it. That's genius. Okay, we're all piling through and showcode is scaring them away with an illusion, chuckle your breath.

02:10:24

Okay.

02:10:28

Oh, stroco ask a coyote to kill them our light so that we can son forward some uh dancing lights as our lights instead. So better we don't give our position away necessarily

02:10:52

I you welcome back one second. Um, no, it's painting light. Don't work. Same way here. I don't hope this. Oh, is it hard to make dancing lights and foundry? No. It's, it's not actually in chewy at all. Um, i don't know if it will work and i don't even see.

02:11:22

Dancing lights on here fellas. It's a spell like help from being a cute tonight. Here we go. Boom. Okay. And guys have a thing.

02:12:05

Don't have the modules installed. So maybe let me import this macro folder.

02:12:19

Like, dancing line. It is installed. I installed it.

02:12:55

May not be able to.

02:13:20

Of might just be restricted to chewy. I read the sequence.

02:13:30

Yeah, yeah, i can't load the two of you sequence macros in.

02:13:40

Well, then we can just work off of coya's light and just say that we're used. Yeah. I imagine there is some way to do it. I don't know how to do it though, and it will take a bunch of time for me, learning how

02:14:00

It will add that time stuck, boundary things to learn how to do so much. It's not even here. She spells he moved.

02:14:13

Abby.

02:14:24

Oh yeah, i'm here. Sorry. Just you guys were back and forth and forever. My brain just it did all kind of hinge on the ochi's question. If no i was willing to which the answer. It's always. Yes. I get to do the mentor thing. Are you kidding? Yeah, yes.

02:14:47

I'm not going to bed or another because no is thing would just be it's just happily slaming on her desk at her head. I'm pretty much the robot, nothing a lot. Um, but you guys were debating it way too much and i was i gotta leave you to it.

02:15:05

You'll come to a conclusion. Oh fuck, i forgot you guys done, Gabe. Koya. Gym of brightness. Yep.

02:15:17

Okay. Show go. Squeeze through the hole what we want to wait until nobody scouts ahead first. Yeah. Oh, are we doing this now? Yes, and koya will waive her staff on at you and give you a pass without trace. Recent rummages around in the the bag of holding pulls out that potion visibility and hands it to no way.

02:15:43

And just in case you're too kind uh and upon during that. So what do i need to get through this uh quiet waves. Your hands with you and provides. You frequent so uh, no. No, i worship does, though, we we're designed to help people get it, not that you would ever condone assassination or thievery.

02:16:15

But and for the benefit of use, the bm being able to see where the hell i am today. As long as i don't have a token selected, i can see you. Okay, cool. So feel free. Yeah. So, um,

02:16:40

So that's not approaching amazing. That's just nice. My normal thing. So, that gets me there. It's one movement. One round, right? So, these braggy areas are 14. Which is one of the rip caves dominated by a deep crevice along this sprawling. Cavern looks like those crevasses. Go off into the darkness.

02:17:18

There all 80 feet deep.

02:17:23

All right. Uh, is this a pathway up here through the no is? Okay cool. Um very quickly uh is like there. Any trucks to show common paths of movement, down this hall. Down this hall and down this hall, not a lot down this hall, not a lot down there.

02:17:48

See it's it's quite small. Yeah, i am. Um but it is it enough that i can happily just like walk around and see if the only fine. Yeah, excellent. The yetis won't fit. Okay, that's that. All right, pack it. Okay, and this is a tunnel. You can squeeze through by the way, it isn't now.

02:18:20

Oh, a quick look, it does a it was thin head down. One, two, three, four, five, six. Seven that way to take a look. See if that comes round this word. Does it curve around you this way? All right, so it does.

02:18:50

Okay, one sec. I gotta scroll up to 12 before consumes me and i this is a common cave roughness of piled, furs or scattered across this broad cavern scattered bones and the stalagmites give mute testimony to past meals.

02:19:12

Okay, so we're nine. Currently do any of them seem like actively readying for, for combat or nope, not on this end. Those were all on the other end. All right, and this wall looks like it. Opens from this side. Do it now.

02:19:39

Uh, check to see if it's going to cause a cave in or explode on me. Or he remember the last time i didn't check traps. So i can't remember. Yeah, so i would i would love to quickly do that if you would like to cook and check or

02:20:04

All right you do not find any traps but you hear heavy breathing on just the the other side of that stone door, really. Oh, i might go just disappeared. I know that's my idea for one second. Um, okay cool. Uh, is there any way that i could like? So this is a flatstone door, there's no key whole, no, nothing, no, nope, just looks like it pushes and moves.

02:20:34

All right. How how much, um, can i potentially, uh, push it forward to, to have a look, it opens wide enough for a yeti to squeeze through. So, it's pretty good sized door. All right, so but the shoulder to it and pushes carefully, all right.

02:21:17

Boom and this Yeti kind of just like hurt and she's wearing a silken scarf. You like looks through.

02:21:34

Does something an aklo. No one responds closest to the shore. Uh yeah. So what was what was like up with the thing around? Yeah, so you can decide if you're gonna go in. Yeah, exactly. I love it. No problem. So, i just need to know how lethal does that really?

02:22:01

Look this wide cavern sores into darkness overhead a deep crevice plummets to the north. Well, to the south of broad switchback road climbed to a distant tunnel mouth. In the center of the cavern skull. Topped columns, surround an octagonal diet age. Foreign steps lead to the top of the day.

02:22:21

As far as stone seat rests between the tests of a bull, mastodon skull a tn style, banner draped over the top, like a canopy.

02:22:39

You do not see this yeti chieftain anywhere, but to be fair, you do see. Sorry, you did see both of the consorts. This one seems to be lounging by a cliff. This one is lounging down by the the penelope by the the pseudo. Yeah. Okay, it does look like a dice system.

02:23:02

Yes, this bit. Um, all right. So that is.

02:23:09

Um so in that case then i guess let's check. Uh, north take a look. I'm not going through, uh, no, not not on this past now, because, okay, i want to make sure there isn't like, i want to get a head count. So i think i'm at 11. The only reason the ad yet, the yeti didn't know you weren't there it's because you got passed without trace.

02:23:36

They have said oh yeah. I know. They have some we have this subscription last time. I know it still wouldn't have helped them fire but she wouldn't smelled you. Oh no, instead of thinking, one of the yeti was playing a joke on her. Okay, cool, cool. Oh, you just ding dong ditch that yeti?

02:24:01

Sounds like something that we would do. Um, so it's another door. Here, it does look like another one of those stories. Yeah. Okay. So i over is, this trapped locked. Gonna kill me, it is not, but this place has its own little description too. But moment, many skulls of bears, wolves, woolly, rhinocerosses, mastodons, and stranger prey apparently hunting trophies.

02:24:29

Rest on a on the large stones around the walls of this cavern the foam roll perception as you go by.

02:24:42

Sure.

02:24:50

27. I would imagine at this point. Ah, yes. All right. So you spot, the consort asleep in the mound of furs in the center. But you also spot. The 21 ready go. 21, hematites. That are each look like they're worth about 50. Gold pieces of beef, eight amethysts, all of exceeding, beauty and cuts worth 500 apiece, and four topaz's of flawless creation, worth 900, gold apiece, just sort of killing in what you're now.

02:25:37

Certain is the chamber of the chieftain of the tribe.

02:25:44

All right, interesting. All right. Cool noted, uh, very quickly, um, making sure this doll looks over here.

02:25:56

You open that door?

02:26:01

Presumably, i can get a slightly better. Look at that room, you can

02:26:09

Okay.

02:26:14

Know. What is so many gemstones? Uh, your polyglot is still on, but what? Yeah, polyglot thing, come on. Yeah, it's listed as common. Uh, i don't understand you something. Yep. None of those understanding because common, for some reason isn't on this one, i'm just turning off that mod on everything.

02:26:37

It, it's a great idea but it doesn't seem to work at all.

02:26:49

Uh, so given the fact that myself is currently in, um, i disappeared through time for sure. No, no. He's just gonna go and feel like, oh, that looks like a lot of stuff open her bag. A reminder bag of holding, just throw it all in as she walks around and sleeping concert, just like all of it in snores, but you see that she has?

02:27:13

She's clutching. She's actually clutching one of the extensive topaz's in her hand. She sleeps quite deeply though. So you managed to take it from her. She she's lucky the now, i think's about it for a very brief moment, to be like, it was, it would be very easy to just kill.

02:27:35

You would be, it would be incredibly easy and the desire to do so is pretty high, okay? I just i want to specifically point out that unless it's for like a demon fortress piezo puts sleeping enemies in almost every single dungeon to reward players who go and stealth and scout.

02:27:56

So i'm just putting that out there, i know which is why i'm didn't the rest of you agree to not the recipe. Yetis. Yeah. Um, more specifically maker basically said, like let's not kill them for the sake of killing them, too much noise. Like,

02:28:25

Get. These are considered very wise. Usually goodbye. The tn people, the mankind people. I should say well i wouldn't know that but it's true you're hungle but the princess wants wants them alive and you're the con to her middle kingdom. Princess. Shut up. Shut up. But yeah. Okay. Interesting.

02:28:56

Interesting. Interesting looking out across this crevasse, uh, is their only this. So these two are consults, right? I they are wearing nice things for yetis. Like this one's got some nice scarf. Uh, this one seems to be like publishing a stone.

02:29:27

I'm sorry. Anything else in this room that if i go near, it's gonna trigger a trap or an alarm system is what? I'm trying not that you can really tell, but it kind of feels like the wind picks up a little bit. Almost like something's breathing very deeply in this room.

02:29:52

That is the air.

02:30:04

You feel surrounded all at once yet you can't see anything.

02:30:18

So the, the air hotness different in here. Yes. Like very distinctly different. Okay. Is it is it similar to the kind of air pants that we had when we were near that tower a little bit? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I know what we're getting out. Okay. Um, that she's in here somewhere.

02:30:41

Yes. Yes, you smart enough to figure out like magic bullshit. Got it. Um, she, she is smart enough to figure that out and, uh, well on that note backtrack so just the thing. So one, two, three, four, five. Uh,

02:31:10

Six seven.

02:31:19

Nine.

02:31:40

Yeah. All right, so after checking that out for a moment or two uh you see nowhere his face pop background,

02:31:54

Oh hey. Okay, you're looking at nine yet? These, he passed back here. And she comes behind her curls around the back of that chamber with on the other side of whatever that is, there's something not right with the air in there. And if i were a bet and woman, that's where you're looking at the bitch with, what's the word that i'm looking for?

02:32:23

It's, it's, it's crimes. Uh, almost like a sparky tingly sensation in the air.

02:32:37

Air rising electric goosebumps static.

02:32:51

Galvanized, the air feels galvanized.

02:32:57

Too long. A word. Very unpleasant vibes not at all on like that tower. There is a way to get to that particular room so long as you can jump the carbon. There's a crevice there too. Deep for me to see the bottom, but it's only about 10 feet. No different than the ones we've seen before.

02:33:23

You just need a way to get past all of the yeah. It is. Ah, they don't look immediately hostile. It seems most of those who've got to the south Huh. Do you think if if i want my initial point of spooking them? Do you think they've run? I don't know when a direction wherever we wouldn't have to worry about them anymore.

02:33:55

If you stick to the left hand side, and follow the wall, and put your illusions to the to the front of that Planters are not going down the left and ignore you. You're like a cramp up in that particular alcove to keep out of sight but she's kind of you know okay?

02:34:14

I don't see why i wouldn't work. All right, then, let's try it.

02:34:24

So go. Well, huh. That forward. Um, about what point do i need to worry about them saying me as he crouches and door step sneaking position. This one. Do you have dog version? Uh, no, i do not.

02:34:47

In that case done, it should be fine. Oh yeah, expense a charge. Give everyone pass without trace. The only cost one charge that stick is possibly my second. Favorite stick, i'll have to get a new one when this one is dead.

02:35:16

So now it gets to like that and then indicates that up this way those, i believe three or four yetis. So it's too much further. It's like that way but you can pass through this way and get to the front of this.

02:35:45

So, just keep going. This way might want to cover your light as you pass this area. But yeah. All right. So,

02:35:59

So, cover koias, light, while we're over here, just light. Like, i can't believe it, but we still need an escape artists to get through that little hole. We always giving you free to movement, okay? Take the charge off, might come in crucial later. Hey well i will actually have to set up and charges because it does not happen for some reason.

02:36:24

And while everyone files in though, make sure you use one for way in. I have she does not need one pretty well. Her way in he just like walks through just fine as everyone follows through though. Uh, you know, it was grace and passes. No just grabs, hold the shoulders and she's like, hey pulls open about Rebecca minor bag of holding.

02:36:46

That's just full of gems of just wiping drool off his face.

02:36:57

Oh, why are we going that way? Because that way leads up to via his direct. If you hug the left side was two doors. The first door has a yeti immediately behind it. The other dollar on the far end. Doesn't. You just have to be very careful about the sleeping one.

02:37:18

All right. So it's going to be a problem once you cause pack and i kind of critic sword. Well yeah. Come on. Right. Just waiting. Not there. Oh, i thought i got him with her.

02:37:38

Weigh-in becomes like an adopted yeti monk after we abandon him here. And it took this photo turns white just start talking aklo.

02:37:59

Man, you guys flip through this cavern fairly easily. I'm almost positive. They gave you the seven journeys for this specific reason. I love that. Stick a great staff. Yeah. No. Specifically goes to this store and puts her back to it. Like no no no no. Big. Big x with arms.

02:38:16

No.

02:38:23

It's gone on this way. There's a head around here except believe there's yeah. She she gets there and then you knows can't stop puts out four and attraction. Which direction was that? So there is four in this one. And this one up here, can we do some stuff rules?

02:38:54

I'm gonna need some stuff rolls. Um, well, is this where we want me to set up my illusions? If the stealth rolls fail, then you can scare them away.

02:39:09

Oh, okay.

02:39:15

That i feel like a stealth roll. No, i don't want to know the information about stuff girls. I want to roll myself. I'm glad that you posted that in the chat. The drilling thing because it reminded me about what you said about the gems. And i just imagine that like after everybody else goes to sleep or like what everybody else is off?

02:39:34

Doing other stuff. You guys just take out some of, like, all the shiny that we've collected and you guys, just like pet it and stare at it together. So this interesting thing happens where no way n wayn kind of looking at each other. I don't want to do it but i will it'll make things easier.

02:39:57

Only if you're willing to do it, you do not have to whatever. It'll give my legs a break. And he just crawls down her arm. Like he's walking towards her wrist and turns into a tattoo on her shoulder. Yo.

02:40:15

Helping also look at this fucking party. I know. Look at this, when she'll go was, like, who wears medium armor? And we're like no one. No. No, we're not. The only downside is that yet. He's actually have good exception and koya.

02:40:42

I don't suppose we can, like, makeup for coya in some way. Okay. I just chug this real fast. I just gives some potion of his life. There's like chill. Good. Yeah, he just drinks it and she vanishes and hold on one second. Let's see, i think i'm missing. Did a makeover roll?

02:41:07

No, oh no. Not yet poet. Does have the lowest though. That doesn't mean anything. It doesn't. But yeah, that was quite as 18 by the way. Yeah, those are 18. Btw. Yeah, i assume your guys's rolls are all fairly high also, but that was a 19 for ohchi just to keep up.

02:41:34

You hear koya, make the sound of trying to make the sound of wind with her voice.

02:41:45

As she drinks the potion advantages she goes. Yes.

02:41:55

Oh, oh, i thought that was. Uh, no. I thought i was uh don't even say it. A mako for a second and yet he just turns around and resumes what he's doing believing that the wind must have been. The wind Grayson reaches in the bag of holy and pulls out.

02:42:16

We have three potions of vanish. I know they don't last very long, but uh and hands them to make a oh maker just casting his ability.

02:42:32

It was one of the first spell she learned.

02:42:37

If you call for another stealth check, oh, geez. You're gonna take one of those potions advantage. Sure. Oh i'll just pull it off the sheet if i needed. Oh cheat not make a stealth check yet. Oh no i did. I was just saying if we have to do, okay?

02:42:50

Every reason. Oh yeah, just loved her way. Free the the main character of this ap is by far koya like the whole time. It's it's quite a micro pieces like it's just us like throwing ourselves at dragons and stuff. It's like, um, the stay at home husbands anime, right?

02:43:18

I've never seen it, but like, the way of the house has been. Yeah, all of us are not gonna lie. I love me some slice of white anime. I haven't seen it or much slice of life but i imagine that's like her that's the style of her anime as she follows us around and keeps us alive and gets up to all these shenanigans.

02:43:37

So does that mean? Koya is the sam to make those Frodo. Oh definitely. Oh, definitely.

02:43:48

That would make a lot of sense for sure. Over the longer. I think about this analogy. The more i realize that it means that grace is probably legalists. And that. No, no, not happy.

02:44:07

Well, i mean sam wasn't exactly a 67 year old woman.

02:44:18

I guess that makes ochi Aragorn. So here's where we were gonna need some stealth thing again. Well, you guys can keep your current self checks, everyone got really good. So we're gonna oh geez. Borrow here because he has a low wheel. Safe. The problem is that the yetis are just really perceptive, they are.

02:44:43

So let's still catches koi's stealth check again. Yeah, she's invisible. Oh, that's right. Okay, and you guys have passed without trace. So,

02:44:54

Name single other party. That could be all of these perception checks. All right, all of you have evaded being seen infiltration, successful. Prayer. Uh, no, i would. What indicate to the that that yeti over there that area over there and then do a page, like, somewhere in the air?

02:45:26

You feel the energy in the room, get even more excited. And you hear a woman's wailing whisper very, very quietly. Just sort of echo, they're here.

02:45:52

No one saw you so you guys can still do stuff. She saw you.

02:46:00

All right, he didn't see me. Uh, you just gonna hand wave that jump there. Shoco. Yeah. Well oh no. No. Is there another way across? Yeah. I've been waiting to bust this one out because i know that if we want to go back to our koya, is the main character thing.

02:46:20

Remember when she feather falls, shoco for his stealth rule or climbing roll or whatever? I have a way to get across this for choco because everybody else we're rolling initiative. Can just jump. Well, you guys are getting another turn before the yetis. Can really jump into action and she's spotted.

02:46:42

You we need to get across. So you guys are getting a surprise room, okay? Uh can uh, i still can't really see what's happening in here, but

02:46:57

It is, it is in darkness. Well, yeah, but the light sources on me because i guessed no, we covered our lights to self. Just. Yeah. But you can uncover. I mean, you, you know, if you cast it on earth on a thing and then put it in your job kit like you can, you know?

02:47:12

Yeah, just pull it back out. So put light on your token. Again, just use dim light. You don't need to use the bright light. It's unnecessary. No, no one's gonna do exactly one thing. Uh, fun hearing that was for. Um, where is where's the other good potion that i had left?

02:47:39

No, no still waiting for you and Grayson on the admission tracker.

02:47:57

In that color, just a little bit more.

02:48:04

The color of lights and brightness to lights, intensify for anyone with low light vision. Yeah.

02:48:17

It's unfortunate. All right, we got quite our own liverson. All right. Uh you said you have a way to get across the bridge or the gap to everyone, not everyone just for shoco because he might not make the acrobatics. I don't know what his skill rings are not yet, but she has a chitin ring so he can shoot a link of chain across and make a little chain bridge to help.

02:48:45

Show, go climb across which reminds me this area over here. My acrobatics isn't really bad. I don't know. Well without breaking character about it, can you make that 10 foot jump? Um, Like say for you, well, i guess this one. Yeah, shrunko looks. And is it and thinks? Yeah, i think i think i've got it and this is all non-verbally.

02:49:15

By the way, just like, oh gee just like looks at it. Looks at you. It just turns his head a little bit eyebrow and sure it goes just like, so go looks at it for a second and then does like a slow nod like that's strong maybe, bro. Recent watches them do this and he's like, in his mind.

02:49:31

He's like, huh, they must be communing again. Yeah.

02:49:40

Thanks for that. Thank you for that. That was incredible.

02:49:48

Well.

02:49:54

That's the running gag on koya. Slice of life show is shoko birds and then maybe like, bro. What, what do you want to go to the caster level?

02:50:11

Is.

02:50:18

That is a dope elixir. How many paul, what's the club, everyone? How many schmeckles is that? This is one thousand schmeckles. That's quite a few schmuckles. My ring cost that many schnuckles like the mako's turn, she's got enough space to get a running start. Uh, you feel invisible woman jog, passed.

02:50:46

May not know a season, just like. And she just says duck to ochi right? Make cocoa. I just pulled him out of the way. Just kind of grout grabs your eyes. And then OG says, i am not a duck. I, and because she has passes outrage, she does not disturb any of the dust or snow as she lands and tumbles on the next side.

02:51:10

Continuing her move up to the throne. He assumed that we're cutting, is that what this is? I kind of assumed. It was like, it is supposed to be a throne. Yeah, and it's very surprised. These i never will find the old maps are really remake them. I really should start remaking these loans.

02:51:30

They're just a little rough to extract. I imagine they don't convert well. Um, Ochi is going to leap. Drawing is sword as he does. I don't think i can even fail this. I'm going to show you my remade map and then you guys can decide if you want to use the j.

02:51:46

Regent maps that are. Yeah, i think like this maps are really pretty but it's the practical aspect but sometimes it's like, what is this representation? Yes, but by the maps have like very little to no detail on them. So OG nowadays landed i was gonna like try and move somewhere.

02:52:09

I don't think i have enough time in the surprise round but he's gonna see this yeti over here. Frees up for a second and then turn around and just look at the way really hard.

02:52:26

And that'll be the end of my surprise round turn. Why are you looking at me? What do i do?

02:52:37

There's not enough time for all these questions in the surprise round. It's true. You're right. And she just makes makes that don't. And, Like,

02:53:08

Christian will leave directly from where he's at to the throne and without even moving just twitches his toes and jump straight there. All right. Chris wants to wait like the extra second just to let show go, make sure he gets across first and then he'll jump. That's what i'm saying about the ring, like, still do that.

02:53:31

But like i was gonna see if shoko made it or if you like didn't try and then i would shoot the chain across and he could crawl across it.

02:53:45

Then he will use key point this with action to get the jump bonus.

02:54:00

You monks and ninjas. You're looking at a DC 20, sir. Okay, you don't have a running start. Let's go. Uh, and you're neither a monk nor ninjas.

02:54:26

Transpire acrobatics. You want to start making some noise with your the drums? Hey. Oh nice.

02:54:47

Is the table based on if you have a running start 50 doubles? Yep. Oh, it's really simple. If you don't have a running start and you don't have the monk and ninja abilities that say you don't need a running start. It's really hard long jump with from standing, so was the jump, not a standard action.

02:55:08

Was it just my movement? It was part of a movement. Yeah but this is a surprise around. Certainly get one great. A move or a standard. All right.

02:55:28

I forgot that i just have the built-in running start thing from key pool. Oh yeah. Like because i just questioned everything. I was like, maybe i can feel that jump on. I got a the travel domain power is a standard action. Not a move action, right? It's just acts as dimension door.

02:55:47

Otherwise, i don't know, it doesn't move. Actually, i don't know, i forgot to put it on her sheet and i had to open the features compendium to get it. Yeah, let me double check, but i definitely feel like it's hard and move action dimensional.

02:56:09

Potential help. You can teleport up to 10 feet or cloud level today. As a move action teleportation must be used in fight for increments. Oh, you see coya like Wiggle her butt like a cat and then like silly run at it and then just disappear from one side and appear on the other.

02:56:32

This is what i'm talking about. That's main character of behavior. Come on now, everybody else all like ultra serious ninja jumps across and she's like that's incredible, only no way. Gets to spit grace, and i didn't even see you flex, with that 55 acrobatics together. Exactly. What you described?

02:56:55

He fucking stutter stepped over there. Grayson is an anime character. What's gonna mario? What's the teleporting step called and bleach? I haven't watched it in so long jump. Yeah, yeah. That.

02:57:15

Of many chain. Yeah also, can you make snowy like, bend the square one square over? Because currently gray sun? Just stood on me. Pretty standing on her head. Grayson's levitating. It's just something what i try. And okay, i tried to move one of you and it's fine. There you go.

02:57:40

We're okay. Thank you. And then quiet, just appears behind ochi campaign this far. The OG you hear behind you and then OG falls and dies because like we discussed it doesn't have feather fall or anything.

02:58:09

Boom. All right. And that was clay's. Turn. All right. Second round of combat. Blessing of river.

02:58:28

He should not be saying all of that out loud. I'm terrible about that. It's it's okay. I literally wasn't listening. There was something you said earlier about a spirit barrier. I'm like this would be really immersion breaking. If i knew anything about pathfinder spells and spell like abilities,

02:58:50

Um, sometimes the game just be like stuff happened. There is no spell equivalent. It's just them on on on on. A standard action uh the electricity in the room thirds of flash angrily, but does not strike this certain Oh, so can we get a description of this room one more time?

02:59:24

I'm seeing now? Yes, zigzag walkway thing that goes up the far side from us, this wide cavern soars into darkness overhead a deep crevice plummets to the north. Well, to the south abroad switchback road climbs to a distant tunnel mouth in the center of the cavern skull top columns, surround an octagonal diet age.

02:59:46

One steps lead to the top of the dias where a stone seat rests between the tusks of a bull, mastodon skull a tion style, banner draped over the top like a canopy sea. It, you would never guess, all of that was in there from this. Nope. Yeah i got these don't even look like pillars.

03:00:04

They look like fucking traffic cones. Maybe they're very blurry. They look like accidents. Um, i'll just so white here. Let me i'm going to show you guys an example of a map that i made. Please do do. The flexing. Is it flexing? I don't i'm not trying to brag enjoy boyfriend.

03:00:31

It is when you're like i'm better than the people, it then, your contracted for paiso about not strange network where the bitches choosing here you

03:01:00

Fuck are all my maps.

03:01:16

And show you that one because magnets is going to see that one in a different game. Oh so is Abby but she's already seen that map. Oh yeah, i know what you're going to get up.

03:01:38

Put them all on a drive. Abby has seen my custom maps and so is Magnus. I i'm i'm not bad. I gotta say. It's true. I'm not bailey wiki good. But if we're good.

03:02:01

Come on. How how does the bitch kill us? This time come out amiko. He doesn't no uh no no no what? I meant not what i meant. So amiko kind of shrugs a little bit and raises 10. No suey. Uh, still shaved and like motions knocking, out the, the yeti.

03:02:33

Yes, good.

03:02:41

Oh, she had to move and feet to get there. So single attack. No fire damage. What are you doing? No, no fire. Turn off. So, whopping eight. Is that with power attack. It is. Okay, that was two. All right, she doesn't have agile on it but she doesn't get that or she takes 30.

03:03:09

All right, so that yet he thinks five of non-lethal damage. It gets sponked, it gets bunked and the potion of invisibility not greater invisibility. Or amigos invisibility, not greater than visibility breaks. Oh, i guess my invisibility. Isn't that powerful yet? And then she looks up at the ghetto. He's like, looks downed.

03:03:43

Okay uh yeah. Watching her unsuccessfully knocked that any out. Was fantastic. So OG's gonna run up and try and do non-lethal to him? What does that look like in elephant in the room? Uh, non-lethal just does but you can't create them on link anymore, okay. So negatives or anything like that.

03:04:06

You say you're doing on lethal and you do cool.

03:04:14

Let's, let's think about this for a second nochi. Why don't we be smart? I don't really want to go up on the oh yeah. That's what i can do.

03:04:35

So before this movement, i would like to say, i'm going to spring attack

03:04:42

That's so we're clear. It's going to be very important with the creatures of reach.

03:05:02

Do we get sneak attack also?

03:05:13

Okay, i'm gonna add them to the initial check and I'll just go. So i don't forget about them, they're not acting this turn or no, they would act this certain. Excuse me. Yes, they would, that's why i wanted to try and run. Few of them out. We went through round one much faster than i thought.

03:05:29

Uh so that's going to be ogster and really very sad. I didn't knock the itty out.

03:05:40

Well, she's at 28 non-lethal of 190 feet. So, kind of figured

03:05:48

All right. No way. It's time for you to non-lethally flends. This yeti.

03:05:56

Oh, this'll be entertaining get up there and exfoliate him. Next, some really deep power washing of their fur. You just massage him so deeply that he faints from the pleasure, excluding strike over the space where you're quite certain. No is and although you can't see her for a fraction of a second from where i like your lights spell is reflecting off of her glasses.

03:06:25

You definitely see. Like just biggest :-( disappointment, just like why you gotta be like that, why you gotta do that to me? Also, can i if it's is that return? Okay. Yes. Okay. Want to finish your time. So, i can know i had already clicked and my turn previously and it's on, you know, I think it's because we added the eddies in it.

03:07:02

Like bounced it back to me. That is feasible. Yeah, that might do it. Yeah, you're right. You're right. But nowhere who is likely. Okay. Okay, fine. And, uh, sorry. Princess as, uh, she kicks off the ground and then just tries to keep this thing directly in the face. Um, so let me see.

03:07:35

Oh shit. Clear. Got teleport from the travel domain. Travel domain. Good. He also got in view with spelled like ability from the community domain. Hi. Claire friends. Right. And telepathic bonds.

03:08:00

Wait. So it hasn't on lethal damage on it now. Can't we just and start doing lethal damage until it pushes it over the edge. Isn't that how that works? I think it's really weird. Never ruled it to work that way. You like to do that and i'm just like that is a really cheap fucking way and people suggest doing what you just suggested and like that is an upsetting.

03:08:26

I will tell you that, no way, a little really like her stuff, is fencing, the side of of creatures and people, you know, no, it's fine. We bumped them so he's fine. Yeah. The it doesn't even it doesn't make sense. When you say it like that, i'd like to say she's a nature and ninja, she's not, you're you're aware of this, that's not what she do.

03:08:58

Um, but that being said, that's but but not do not. So not be saying again. I don't want to eat, you know, i getty attack that seems unnecessary but i'm sure pizza in here. So if you can pull attack, frankly reason will make a charge attack. Yeah. Get them, bro.

03:09:28

This is happening.

03:09:35

So add a plus two to this attack roll.

03:09:44

And certainly, it's and he, he's unable to not do the acid because these wearing those gloves, it just happens whether he wants it two or not. All right. Well, i am gonna call that 18 points of non-lethal then and six points of burning.

03:10:08

Uh, a bit of a smelly hair situation going on, that brings the Yeti up to 71 non-lethal damage though. It doesn't even gone yet. So from this direction, do we hear yetis flat footed ochi uh roll? I think attack for me, she has an active concerned so she's still flat footed.

03:10:34

I believe i put it in there, did you? Yeah. That's in there. Oh, okay. Never mind shioko. Uh, do we hear yetis like mobilizing and like commotion for destruction? I mean, i see one right here.

03:10:51

Uh, yeah, she's about to engage in combat and murder. Okay. Um then i guess it's time to back up a bit and uh start of my illusions. Um, so first off, it's a free action. I start setting my uh daring thing lights too flutter to and fro along the crevice.

03:11:17

Taking the form of four will of the wisps. Like i says they could do and then i will cast on a silent image so that's for 10 foot cubes plus one per level. So that's that's 12 cubes worth. That's that's 12 10 foot cubes. So, that's just like the entire crevice will start to of those green specters.

03:11:54

We encountered, we'll start rising from the crevice.

03:12:01

Well, no, it's not. It's not will toward it's, it's will to disbelieve if the interact with it, isn't it? Well, he's dropping it on this one. So no i set that's that. Do you not see my my token? I see your token. I'm sorry. My my cursor. My cursor.

03:12:19

Oh, okay, so you're on this side. Yeah. Yeah. To like dissuade them from coming over. Oh no, she's coming. Over is this participal over here?

03:12:35

Uh, it's a very narrow edge for a very large creature. For a very large creature. The consorts are not scared of the undead. Oh okay. Then i guess i'll i'll have them. I'll have the spirits focused on this door. That's where or wait. No. The yetis could come from here too.

03:12:58

So but but she could communicate to them once she jumps through them that they're fake. You were attributing far too much intelligence to them. Oh okay. Then yeah, the the crevice starts to spit for the specters as my concentrated illusion. Give me a book. Check, that's what really matters.

03:13:32

So they're going to need a 28. Not even think that those are specters rising up to murder them because they had nothing they could do when the specters murdered their kin.

03:13:47

A little bum. Anything else on your zone? That will be the end of my turn.

03:14:00

This lady is going to

03:14:15

Gonna bite amigo. And then trying to clock racing and hmm. No, or maybe ochi? All right. One is grayson two is. Amigo. Three is ochi for who's getting the claw attacks? Oh gee of course. It's where i'm here. For grayson is one. I think it was two for the bite.

03:14:42

Attack two single attack.

03:14:52

Nice set up her pairing ability.

03:15:10

Have that anymore. That's right. All right. So, that is actually going to hit her.

03:15:20

New clothes attacks.

03:15:25

That's a hit and a hit. That was a 17 and an 18. Oh boy, are you, are you ready?

03:15:46

Over the rand. I was not and then it runs you. That felt fantastic. Oh,

03:16:01

You hear her say oh fuck no, no way. And then she appears right next to ochi,

03:16:23

And you get 28 points of healing, and you feel a coyote touching you

03:16:39

The uni savages. Well, the Yeti consorts. She is going to leap through the illusions. He doesn't have to make macrobatics. Check the jump that distance, not really.

03:16:59

Boom, she can't even really fit down that grass.

03:17:06

So, she could get stuck in it, but they also have their climb scene.

03:17:18

Goo goo, which will really just slow them down.

03:17:26

A little bit uh i will be using my reaction to dodging panache this attack. She's about to make all that's good because she's coming for you necromancer.

03:17:39

So, i five footstep away and it's oh, oh, that's a 30 to hit. Oh, 30 days. But uh, where is it? I think it's a plus six. Yes, plus six. I get you two of 31. AC doesn't it? Uh, i believe, is it my original to my AC or?

03:18:02

Yes, it's your current AC. Okay. Okay, but i do, i move by feet. I'm trying to i can't move my character because it's gonna stop my turn. Yeah. Oh there, i will turn three movement back on there. All right, actually. No, i'm over here so but i can be within distance to start wheeling on this lady.

03:18:27

Speaking of that lady. Boom, that is not five feet of movement, sir. It's not, it's not. If i put that what choco met was, instead of stepping here with his five foot step, he would step here. So that next turn, he can five footstep there. So no, i understand what he's saying is movement is not a five foot step.

03:18:58

So, the large yeti was reach. That's already in. Melee range with him. Gets to make an actual opportunity.

03:19:11

So, it's nachoco's. Turn the movement dodging panache provokes as a normal from creature's. Other than other than the target. A good you are in range of this yeti. Now, i'm on the same conversation. Okay. So, so here would be the place to go. You're gonna provoke from her one way or another.

03:19:34

It's not a fight footstep. Oh, it's movement. Okay then. Yeah rescua. Oh, so if you've got 50 foot reach,

03:19:46

That's that's within 10 feet of reach nose. 15 feet on top under. It's saying she has reached to that square.

03:20:01

The fuck. Yeah, just 10 foot range.

03:20:07

Radio 10 foot range, instead of reach that what's going on, it's saying that i would be 10 foot movement. If you were to move that way, but reach for reach as concern. It's it's a it's it's 10 feet, it's rather. It's saying that it would be 15 feet if you tried to move there.

03:20:31

If if the Yeti has 15 foot reach then yes any direction Shoko moves, it would get an attack of opportunity. If it has 10 feet of reach, it could only get shoko if he went into that square. Not this one. So you started in this club, hold on it's bite is listed as having a 20 foot reach for some reason.

03:20:53

I want to double. What does it have? Like alien. Jaws. What the heck? Yeah. Like operation of a sorcerer. Well, they freak out low. Yeah, that was about. So that would explain a lot. These are the many, many, many, many generations later. Alien crossover descendants in the glorian setting.

03:21:18

Because as a tall 10 foot, as a tall large creature, you have your immediate five foot spaces around you that are you know, adjacent to you that you can strike. And yeah, i thing, but trying like just out, it's set to reach.

03:21:46

Where is it getting this 20 foot range from?

03:21:59

No. Just god creatures that have height that are tall usually only have 10 feet. So is it willing of spare or something? It does have a sphere. Yes. That's probably where he's getting the 20 foot. It's a long spare, but there wouldn't be on the bite. Then someone be able to close all bite.

03:22:17

If they're holding it alongside it would not. And they do not, i do not see, so on its natural attacks. For some reason, instead of having the retreat they have ranges on their natural attacks which like only assume was another one of those issues that came from the SBC converter.

03:22:38

Yeah, i would recommend looking at the book at this point. I cannot actually find. Where did that range is coming from? Because the range on their attack, it's set to reach.

03:22:56

I would say this safe. Bet is 10 feet. Honestly, i'm gonna put none and see what that does.

03:23:09

It says, it's none. Okay, so now it has zero range with it. We're gonna set it to melee now see if that fixed it.

03:23:24

It's at 10 feet now and it still says that squares within range. Well, this one. Yeah, that's very specifically every square in this square is in her reach. Apparently, according to the in-game measuring tool, i mean, usually a 10 foot reach like that. Does let you hit diagonally 10 feet.

03:23:54

My diagonally two squares rather at least that's how i've seen. People describe it, everything in that ranges, they're threatened area, according to this. On, on her natural attacks. Yes, here is actually farther than that. All right. And honestly, eating the natural attack, isn't the worst thing because it'll it'll open up you guys to move around without revoking, is this.

03:24:24

Yeah. So her spear comes out to these squares and then staggers in a pattern,

03:24:36

I don't know just where the like that's a different thing for movement. Those is the actual attack, residence.

03:24:50

But there's nothing stopping you from using dodging fanatic again. Is there and no except the fact that it's an immediate action. Then yes, you can't do it again.

03:25:04

Um, trade the six damage for for 11 damage. Hooray. Um, early on damage previously. She did. Oh my god.

03:25:18

Um, they both rolled really well to attack, though. They do have very high attacks. Well. Yeah. But then they roll the 19 and a 17. They that's fair. That is also true. They are rolling very well in our literities. Um, so how do concentration smells work in Pathfinder? Do i have to make a check to maintain it now?

03:25:37

Yes.

03:25:42

Isn't it like against the damage taken uh DC10 plus damage taken? I believe so just a cool 38 caster level check to maintain no big deal 38 21 company with her bites. Not her damage. Well, you're right. I'm sorry. I saw the big numbers and panicked. Well there goes our plan.

03:26:05

Because shoko rolled a four. There goes our plan because they rolled a 19 and a 17 and sugar world of war because that's fair. Can't you fire it back up after you get out of range?

03:26:21

Uh, i can. But like i imagine these yetis have a pretty good move speed. I think they're about to be here. Boom. Boom. Now a mako. All right. Heck will attack boom, still no fire damage so minus 4 but 19 more non-lethal that brings her up to 90 of 103 cookie.

03:26:59

Oh boy.

03:27:05

Well, an attempt to get this to go a little bit faster. Oh she's gonna say why won't you go down as he's swinging uh to challenge this yeti.

03:27:22

And then we'll full attack.

03:27:32

So, the first one is plus seven. So the first one was also more than enough to knock her unconscious. If it hit, i'm sorry, that's a 16. It does. Hit their AC is 16. Oh, those are bad roles. Okay, if you roll the 19 goes blanking. Yeah yeah. Oh yeah, i forgot to put the flanking on there again.

03:27:56

So, one fourteen,

03:28:04

In the past savings.

03:28:12

Rise. Go into like the swirlies like from the pokemon anime. When Yeti consort is unable to continue. That's kind of exactly what happens.

03:28:30

Um, and then OT will five footstep this way.

03:28:37

No way.

03:28:42

Uh, do you want to do anything with your move action high five foot stepped on the corner? Space. That's fair. You cannot stop there. Well, i full attack. So, if i bump into koya, i'll just add you around here to there. Yeah, but only your first attack like, actually nothing out.

03:29:02

Yeah. So you can abandon your full attack and take a move back. Then if you'd like yo then i will be i'm sorry i'm about to release the all key when i stopped talking and that's not where i want to go at my anyways and i'm afraid to go on the deus.

03:29:16

I would have liked to have taken. It longer route to get there if that makes sense. Oh, what we will do? Then thing you went here, i've got 60, i've got plenty to do. You got plenty and went down and over. Are you acrobatic thing? Those last 20 feet though.

03:29:40

Thank god. Combat reflexes. Okay. Um, they don't actually they do have improved critical though. And improved drag and greater drag, please stop. I think i can acrobatics the last 20 feet. You know she already made. No, she didn't make it that opportunity but i'm just yoga dozing canaster. Yeah.

03:30:10

What does that cmd? Boom, boom. It's barely enough.

03:30:23

Foreign visible now or she using greater invisibility? Yeah, it's an attack. She just kept to this. Uh yeah, she can't feel like healing spell.

03:30:39

As a where could get used to this? This splitting around combat invisible healing people. You see why i like it now i do. I do, i understand person and then no way it pulls out a cheese grater and he hands it to her and says happy birthday quick, go to town on them.

03:31:09

I'm not being given authority to go full whole cheese blender. So will not go for cheese blender yet? Think about it aggressively.

03:31:37

Uh, which one are you going after? Oh, there you are. I could not see you. 21 building illegal. Yep. Have i have tried these two swords that are currently going unused. In my hands. I'm very upset about it. And equipment takes her action. Now the stone warps around the form of a gigantic yeti, atop the stone diets and she erupts out covered in the power of the inferior of the abyss.

03:32:32

And then screens is rage when you vanish again, let me make sure i have all this set up, right? It's set to a cleric levels so i have to roll it from her token off the best token.

03:32:55

It's kind of briefly bring her token over. I'm sorry possessed. Oh, now i'm over here. Okay.

03:33:11

Channel to harm.

03:33:17

Katyana, does not bother trying to exclude anyone. She doesn't have selective channel anyways.

03:33:33

I'm going to use resolve to roll twice.

03:33:45

And i'm glad that i did. Oh my god.

03:33:57

I could feel it coming. Oh i don't want to say i've like invested in my will save and they still come out like this still it came to this. We did everything right? No one yeti and coyote take half damage one yeti. We'll save the one who's currently up in battling and i might go take full damage.

03:34:35

Uh, so yes, crackling ice and electricity starts shredding an assaulting everyone in the room. So is that harming the unconscious yeti? I don't want to be blamed for their death idiots and she is shredding. The unconscious yeti? Yeah, i thought she would

03:34:56

I can kill this one. Right. I guess that word. Kills us and then lightning coalesces in the top of the cabin and strikes a theme. This is very rude. I knew it was coming. I knew it was coming, is this huge sized?

03:35:31

Now should be large size. Oh geez. In the most dangerous position i've ever seen ochi in. Yeah. Yeah. Just because you're taking up. Nine question. Oh that's because she's not actually i set her on that middle. Five foot square. Yeah, for thematics, i got that. Yeah, part of me was like what is the range of fat?

03:35:55

Fat fat thing. And i don't like does not seem to have a sphere on it. Most videos cotyana does not like them. Uh it does have fury of the abyss though on it. By the way guys, you don't know what period of the abyss does. I'm i'm gonna take a guess based on by bad things always happen to me feelings and say that with me being close to it.

03:36:28

I'm gonna take even more damage or something. Oh it has it has the demon. No man. Oh no. Yep. Oh, you was a priestess of stupid. And she remains to what one even as a ghost christen. Well, since people said, feel free to kill this one. Uh, it is talking a free action.

03:37:01

Yeah, here is chief Bormong merged, by the way. Um, should not go. Uh, looks to grace and and says can you use this thing and pointing at the the the broad sword on its hip right now. No. All right, that proficient. Sorry. Oh, you don't have monk proficiencies. I have month proficiencies but monks aren't proficient with with her?

03:37:31

Yes, yes they are there. Yes, the specific specific bank weapon and it's not listed in the month weapon proficiency. It's a specific weapon. The base weapon is a nine ring. Broadsword question mark. Yes, which i believe monks are proficient with. Uh, this can expel the spirit if you could just hit her with him.

03:38:03

Can also just kill them. But, um, all right. Sure. Uh grace, someone come forward and i guess use an action to take it off. Your hip is an action to take it from me, if i'm offering it. It costs more than drawing. So i would if i was jamming I'd say you could as part of your movement or as a move action, take it off.

03:38:35

Yeah. If you, if you take, took your turn to draw the sword and offer it to him. That would be one thing. I don't recall you drawing that sword. No, no. You would have to move up to you and then draw it and collecting an item up of another person's person is always a move action and or a full round action, if they can't help you or tell you where something is

03:39:02

Okay, so it's up to you Grayson. Do you think it would be worth it to try this? Or do you just want to kill the thing if you want me to try it? I will.

03:39:15

I'm putting a step forward and take it from your hip if you let him. Yeah.

03:39:25

Is anybody have jordan the axes pigeon nail address.

03:39:47

Uh you know what? Everyone give me a sense motive. Check. Actually, i just want to point out this would not have been fun at all. If we had fought all these yetis That's about right. Here comes my hyrule. We ready for my hyrule?

03:40:12

Like the left and right hands be thrown basically going moderate murder rate, just kill it. Yeah. Koya. This, the actual person with sense. Yeah. Actually, you would koya and Grayson both realize that the yeti chieftain is fighting the possession or at least trying to katiana is not in complete control of that body.

03:40:44

My last three rolls are four, three, and one. I know and if no one got it, i was just gonna say yes. Just kill him. But but oh yeah, and gray, symbols, got over 20 and coy had that 20. So she likes sees the sorrow and regret in the candy cheats inside is this as a result, this is flavor stuff.

03:41:06

Is this as a result of her immediately channeling and killing some of the yetis? Yes, actually. That's what i thought he was not prepared to her to try and just murder his lovers. He loves his consorts, so i'm looking into this. There is, there's nothing here telling me that i am proficient with this.

03:41:30

It has the monk special ability but that just means i could use it as part of for a flurry of blood. If i was a normal mug, if you were a normal month, you may not have permission through it because you are uh, as an archer. Well i have all the normal month weapon proficiencies as well.

03:41:50

Oh not on that actually. No the nine ring broadsword is not on the monk preferency with with the temple sort is it's a special monk weapon groups, blades, heavy monk. That's the fighter weapon group. That's not the defining thing. That makes it through with spices. That's yeah, yeah, that's not a monk thing.

03:42:09

That's a fighter thing. Welcome to Pathfinder. And then the monk special ability in the book, says a monk weapon can be used by a monk, to perform a flurry of blow. Yeah. And regular monks have in like one of their very first abilities. They're proficient with all among weapons, but zen archer mode, probably doesn't no, the the monk thing doesn't say your proficient with all monk weapons, huh?

03:42:36

List out. Weapons. Individually internet. If i'm not even profession with all simple weapons, no, not proficient. But you can use slurry of blows with any weapon that has the monk trait. That's what the monk trait gives, right? But i can't do that. So yeah, correct. So no he actually really can't use it.

03:42:55

Well, it's completely, right? I will not take it from your bell just showcode says take this. And you're like, what the fuck am i gonna do with that? I can't use. It can all my co use it. Or did she give that up too, though? When he goes a sorcerer now, she just levels so she can use a marshall weapon.

03:43:19

Yeah, but she's wielding and no sui. Oh my okay, okay i guess. So the show goes, just gonna have to try and swing with us. Five strength, man. Oh, if you want to hurt his swing into deep possessing, yeah, she can do that but it's not her turn. Yeah, nice.

03:43:39

Like this thing, just appeared and specifically waited, for no way to become visible gracious. Leave no ways there taking that ochi strap the wide sprint into the crovals. Yeah. Yeah, i think that's a is an attack of opportunity and you will have to roll acrobatics through this square to get there bormer.

03:44:04

You have the movement does not have great effort. Watch out for beetle board. Big bad. Beautiful forks. I was hoping everybody remembered that one. I've used the love. Beetleborgs that was so pissed. It only got the one season that in the nights of tier to know, which eventually let me to a love of gaelic mythology.

03:44:28

So i did not know. I needed it as a child. Yes. So that is, uh, not lethal damage, excellent, non-lethal acid, damage, bringing us. Well yeah, the one point of acid will be lethal. It's just the rest of it. It just burns a little bit. Excellent. It sounds. It shoko, broco draws out the sword and propers it to on.

03:44:58

They go and says the same thing on it. Shoku shoko, shoko, i want to point out to you that the save to de-possess. The thing is like a 17. Yeah, but it's it's a chance to end the fight in a single stroke. Like um, so then what do i have to debuff saves here?

03:45:22

Yeah, if that's still your strat and you can debuff, the saves it. Absolutely. I just wanted to point out to you the math because i did look at that in the beginning was like that's a really bad save for such a cool weapon. That's a really good save for an item honestly, uh, whether or not the priestess of fifid will fail, the will save is a different matter, but it's a shot.

03:45:53

He is an actual cleric. Yeah, just as like a it's a move action to to draw and proper the sword. So i still have my action right? Great. Then i will attempt to concentrate on a second level spell.

03:46:11

Hallelujah. We will make me a safe against mortal terror. Targets. The more or the other yeti born more.

03:46:26

So 23 to save. And even if she succeeds, she's still shaking for around which still gives her a minus two on saving those

03:46:44

And then you pour some negative 2 or something. Negative 2. Yeah. So it's technically reaches out that i need. Well this is a second level spell. I have a plus six to charisma greater focus and the money. Yeah, but you you have effect notes in there, that modify the dc.

03:47:04

So we we've counted them. So she need. Oh, i forgot to put in the minus two, which brings her to a 22 did. I just i was about to say, did i just hear a? But you have great though because that should say this two favorites to happen using some less, it's something else.

03:47:23

Uh, i thought i had already put that in there. That's fair enough. I will be fine. No, you only have rig dealer yourself. Focus in there. So that should be a plus two, which makes that a DC 23 that she has to make with negative 2 on her save which means she got a 22 Okay, then Because it has a KitchenAid.

03:47:58

Don't you also have an additional plus one to enchantments pills? Yeah, that's all that's what's already in there. Um wait. And what's your cell focus for for enchantment? Oh um, i think i think i manually went in there and offset the spell level. Oh yeah. Yeah, i have manually.

03:48:24

Uh, oh yeah, the effect note was from like way earlier in the game when i couldn't figure out how to make it. Okay. So that is your DC. Then that is my DC. Okay? And she makes it and she's shaking for a turn. Yes.

03:48:42

Which only works because you're a dirge singer.

03:48:54

I'm about to get deleted, please. Do not get related.

03:49:06

Uh, anything else, mr. Shoko, uh no, that'll be that.

03:49:15

Before your charges one charge per week, got it.

03:49:30

Yeah, di savage is unconscious. We're just gonna remove her from the combat. Oh, i thought that was the yeti savage next to me. That's why i was painting. I'm in full attack range of two very scary yet. It's right now.

03:49:51

It's gonna trundle her away right over here. Oh no. Not over here, over here.

03:50:04

OG you will die, if she doesn't do something for you.

03:50:18

I am alive, at least katiana held her action. Try and get the invisible people because she was top of the round. I thank you for your mercy. So spaghetti. Consort. Look at her husband like what the fuck at the yeti concert spins on her husband? That just attacked her.

03:50:43

It does does say something in act low years and she responds then uh poor among responds in aklo. Boom. This is going to be very important. Oh hell yeah. I am on the way. I need the token. The thunder. You.

03:51:19

But she gets the minus 20, so, that's 13. Here's here's how this conversation went. What the fuck, man? Oh, my bad. It was an accident and she's like, yeah, exactly. He said i won't call the cops. I won't listen to my friends. Uh, yeah, she's going to full attack her husband.

03:51:39

Oh shit. That hits. Yes. Domestic dispute way she uh she didn't buy his shit even though it was a 33 but she gonna minus 20, oh, for doing damage, right? Okay, we're doing something that pause. Yeah, yeah. Gotcha. Almost got it, almost got it because cut you gotta has a really high fucking blood check.

03:52:07

But unfortunately, the ready does not successfully end rent or do you both damage?

03:52:24

13.

03:52:29

And he held them pain. I'm gonna go is going to lay on hand yourself.

03:52:48

And by footstep onto the stairs.

03:53:00

What was that? Sweet rapier attack with sweet, rapier attack. That was wrong. Weapon is what that word, unfortunately. Both of those are going to miss. Oh, did she decide? Not to take and sword. No she hasn't. She just he didn't click the room weapon. I completely forgot. Actually that she had it.

03:53:24

Hold on. She is going to play with that. She'll pull out her third weapon. Yes, apologies. And that is going to have a bunch of completely different modifiers because she can't use weapon finish with it. Oh yeah, that's the thing successfully hit. I also couldn't really use that the same way that you can't really use it shoko.

03:53:53

Oh, gee, the can pick the AP. Gave us the answer to this encounter and none of us could use it. The AP also gave us table and traditional. And we never had to a mako so yeah.

03:54:08

Um, give it to the yeti. Oh, jeez. Like positives for a moment. Don't ironically if you speak act long uh she doesn't but she speaks Tian and actually she won't make that second attack. He just says, catch Brooks and happy daddy.

03:54:40

So ochi's going to five foot step up. And then i'm gonna suspended key point to do extra attacks extra attack. Now, when she's not gonna do that but yet he has no idea how to activate the sword. That was silly.

03:55:08

Is this evil? Uh, i caught Tiana's evil but the being in front of you is not. And when i'm gonna get into that um does the does anybody know if the haze check box adds the modifiers? Because i would like to use it for my extra key point attack, but i don't want to do it if it's going to mess up my numbers.

03:55:31

It doesn't all no. The base buff does cool. So i'm going to press the haste, check box and we'll do a bunch of swings.

03:55:43

That was a horrendous showing unfortunately no those are gonna hit it even. Did you put the bus to actually even once? Plus two, it won't hit. Yeah. And i did not but yeah, sad day.

03:56:02

Um yeah. Sugar gone with challenge. Make sure that all the challenge o g will start crying. No way. I was just like one of these will hit for sure. One of these will hit, this is my worst decks being a fucking god-stat. Paiso expects the party to have somebody with strength in it but whoever takes strength.

03:56:26

That's is not a good session and especially not this point in time though. Thanks builds are harder to get off the ground and strength builds. Yeah.

03:56:41

Very good but like yeah, it's not all that, right? So uh this is why important important thing. I was like how many spurs does this take up? Because i need to know. If i five footstep here, am i going to be able to swing? It's uh it's big beard.

03:56:55

Let me, let me put him in the actual squares that he takes up. Yeah, so deny me my fault attack. That's that's what i need to know, right? And you know, ochi and the mako are on the diets doing battle with him. That's the thing, the matches on you.

03:57:15

I don't know. This is their gridding.

03:57:23

Yeah, they were like, we're gonna put a 20 foot wide space, taking our 10 10 foot by 10 foot space. Taking Yeti on a five foot by five foot day is the math. Ain't nothing. I think the grid just doesn't work with this map because the grid was made 10 years later when for the online version of the game.

03:57:50

Yeah, there's no online version. This one the earlier maps were like this moving quen along. Um, yeah. So that's the totally fine. Uh, two things. One, a nico and ochidad. Are you using lethal damage against all good? Friends. Here i did not call out non-lethal and i was fully intending to do.

03:58:12

Lethal. Damage to this guy. Yeah. Mako is not risking it against katiana. Yep. Okay. And would you like me to make up a sense motive to see this individual is going to? Oh she did full attacker her husband. Okay, it doesn't know what the spirit sort is.

03:58:40

Yeah, that yeti changes, her mind fully after a makeup. It's her husband and then throws the sword at her. So, the actual movement path is more like a map of that happened.

03:58:55

This implication gets there and feel like eating contact from this thing, so i'm just going to stab and go invisible again. Still have you. You do have that prepared?

03:59:18

Okay out. Yeah, teeth so i can kill it again. I've never wielded this weapon before. I'm trying. Oh, you're trying racing. Might actually be the best suited to wield this thing, even with the, but the subtraction for wielding a And tackle would be a plus 4, you guys keep telling me, he's a strength come up with no deck, but i just assumed that it was super so no, he's a wisdom monk he's got a strength of 16.

03:59:56

Oh, but he's not proficient and i roll the one. So it's that like kamiko has a plus seven is what she has. Yeah, that's a better chance to hit them. Grayson would have.

04:00:16

What? Well, yeah. I don't. Oh yeah, i have the strength of five, bro. Of course, you're the same age

04:00:31

Swift action theory of the abyss.

04:00:39

Boom.

04:00:48

Please don't break my arm. Please don't break mom. I'll break you. Some come in. By uh yeah i would love some what is reducing the damage perfectly attack role. It should just be a plus 11 but it's plus one. Okay. Uh, so let's see. Who wants the, why?

04:01:24

Uh, when is the mako Q is ochie? Oh gee. Before this really happens. Major armor is an armor bonus. It is. Okay. There's one of the double check. My AC was correct before we made this happen. Continue 26 dead. As a tie. Hit me. Yes. Planet hits me. Not hurting.

04:01:57

All right. And then full claw attack on a mako.

04:02:15

Thank you.

04:02:21

Both of those hitch. Where is the red damaged?

04:02:38

Complaints friend, there we go.

04:02:49

Schedule a phone though, katiana sinks her claws into a mako's torso and blood kind of just erupts out of a mako as almost most of all of her health has gone in that first around the attacks, uh, bringing her to six hp.

04:03:23

Uh, crystal do is bullet pack on the cheap. Then this point not carrying if the chieftain dies or not.

04:03:40

Not create a tackles for most of them. 30 hands.

04:03:47

He does not benefit from her dr. So, 30 hits 28, heads 15, misses 23, misses 20, misses

04:04:01

This is end of book, boss fight.

04:04:13

Still guys. Anything else movement?

04:04:21

Any movement for me. Let's do if i put something.

04:04:38

Let's go. Um, rondo rondo. That's right.

04:04:56

Well, now the entire cave, definitely knows what we're in here.

04:05:09

Out of curiosity, you have enough bard levels. Now, are you giving it to the yeti? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. He gets for Rondo, she's helping us. I don't care. Won't be safe.

04:05:36

Excellent.

04:05:40

And sugar will five foot step forward to try and draw some macro.

04:05:49

And then i will end my turn.

04:05:56

I'm off. Queer shoes.

04:06:02

Everyone gets taste. You have been inspired courage right now. I haven't. Excellent. All right. Well, koya is gonna do her her thing since she's been holding on to her channel energies, and she hasn't moved this turn. She is going to exclude, the yeti chieftain for now.

04:06:38

Our signature move the double channel.

04:06:52

She just sits there. Safe from harm.

04:07:05

So 11 and then 17 points of healing. Uh, she does not exclude the yellows.

04:07:19

Oh, hopefully one concert can convince her friend there that? Uh, who immediately snaps awake hopefully.

04:07:50

All right, that require, it's Yeti screams in tien. And her sister are not her sister as she awakens entián. It was a lie. She is betrayed our tribe. Our love is lost. Fuck me and just leans in and hair is a chunk out of the sheep. Just with her teeth.

04:08:26

Oh my god. Is that too critical red, those two crits on. That was a crit on her claw attack at written on her bite attack. He has not rended yet. Yeah, but yeah. She gets around fucked my life begins and hp back. I can buy myself flowers plus 1983.

04:08:55

All right. Yes. So she just leans over and fucking annihilate. This dude dropping him from a hundred and twenty hp. Almost to 20, few.

04:09:12

And he just loses all pretense of being anyone but katiana and says, got what the fuck? Oh, does she get a haste attack?

04:09:28

Uh, we'll make it her bite attack.

04:09:37

It. Misses, boom. I mayco. No, no, no, no, no. Hold him down, don't kill him, he's just possessed. We can save him. She says, hold him down while i hit him with this sword until he gets some possessed everybody. Yeah, and she does continue just trying to smack him with the blade.

04:10:03

Oh gee, it will be a lot easier when he's bleeding out on the ground and then, oh, she's gonna swing on the student bunch of times.

04:10:17

Change. Yeah, we're gonna challenge.

04:10:23

To my thingy's work. There's one the other thingy singing that doesn't work. It's going, that's okay.

04:10:38

Yeah, it started.

04:10:53

Okay. So, first attack, get seven extra damage to it.

04:11:06

And then 17 points damage. Nope. Uh, that confirms. Oh excuse me. It does 11 points damage. It does not confirm.

04:11:25

You need to be undead. You're not actually dead.

04:11:40

So, i do want to point out like, well, i need to knock to not kill him. Wasn't just an altruistic thing, but hopefully we would have an ally when caution is ghost pops out of him. Yeah, i didn't think i was gonna do another damage to knock him into negative 21.

04:12:01

Hey, no. He's definitely a negative but it's not in control. You get him saying like he goes unconscious, the ghost comes out, then we can go, that was my hope.

04:12:18

So this is just an unconscious body. That's it's still not unconscious. I guess. Come on. Die hard. Yeah, what? Oh,

04:12:40

Though here's the fun thing about this is not something that would be apparent. Is that like he should be going down and should be dead, but is he looks really, really fucked up. But tatiana fights in borberg's body until he dies or she is expelled. Fantastic. So, let's start over, everybody switched to bonking.

04:13:17

I mean one point and non-level garage causes somebody who's on that hard window to polygons.

04:13:28

Right? If you're up and walking about with diehard and you're taking lethal, doctors, find the moment, you take a single point of money with them and you actually call unconscious.

04:13:41

Accidentally. How does that work? Pathfinder doesn't make any sense Pathfinder. It's it's actually a thing. Specifically give you an option to do something, even under diehardt so that you don't kill them. We want to talk about how Pathfinder doesn't make sense. Let's talk about how fall damage or falling happens instantly and you fall for the entire round, the distance that you would travel in that amount of time before you could do anything.

04:14:08

Okay, let me double check and make sure it's not the way her possession works and Being being possessed. If shadow demons will tell me, anything does not mean that's they're able to put your body without you being conscious, you still need cognitive minds to control the body. You just dominate.

04:14:34

It would be like charming, someone who's asleep? I guess i am trying to help you because i'm telling you right now. If it goes to know what time you still standing, this is going to be a, a blender fest. She's greater. Yeah.

04:14:54

We'll just say that you knocked him unconscious and she erupts from his body.

04:15:09

Boom. Boom. Boom. Lord. No, i can't deal with that right there and

04:15:21

That's about lump to the ground.

04:15:28

I like the way he's like swagged out with his cool armor and his wives, he just makes them run around naked. That's this. It's really something. And i had the ghost by her, by the way, because they did not provide me already ghosts. Why much? I don't know. So i have i had both of these and i just turned one blue and transparent.

04:15:56

Hell, yeah. Okay, well it's appreciated that you did and yes she rises from where he was standing sort of she's still standing on top of the diet and loading in the air.

04:16:15

Range. I'm gone through two of my three challenges in this one. Fight that happens. Better to use your resources. I've gone through seven people. Instant total of God, transfer all of this. This, this

04:16:45

Add her to combat.

04:17:01

14.

04:17:07

Two 14. No one else is there and we'll remove him and combat. All right. That was on Eastern, no way.

04:17:21

Hi, it's me. I have flanking right now, don't i? Hello. Yes, invisible. Um it's true. No way it pops up says deja vu. Bitch. Yeah. All right, so debating. How how do you want to go around this? Um,

04:17:56

Are you fucking kidding me? Hold on, hold on. I need to look at ghost rules, holding oh actually continue your attack. Sorry, i need to look at these before, her turn. That is it's a standard action. Oh, thank god. Oh, okay. Uh yeah, her blessing of further is no longer help, assisting her.

04:18:27

Um yeah. So no way seeing like you know terrible confirmed is like okay uses a key point to immediately kamikaze and then we're gonna after we're just gonna go home supposed to talk on, this will be against flat footage.

04:18:53

So that'll be i'll be fun with an addition translations. You venture grace too. Slightly easier.

04:19:10

So, this is my main hand swings.

04:19:22

Boom. Boom. I don't know why it's not including my thing. Oh, it's because it's using the inventory i want. Why is this linking to my inventory? One. It's not be doing that. Yeah, i don't see any kamikaze being in there, it really.

04:19:39

Let's try this again. Use the prop one if you could be so fucking kind. That's the one you want you why though? Yeah.

04:19:56

Uh, you bypass hurt the r, if you have a magic weapon, 30 2 points damage an additional all-time swines. It also happens but i think that one she has no natural armor. So cleansing strike does not apply.

04:20:23

A 21 hits, 23 hits and boom. This is all. I should know. This is all ghost. Touch. Yes. Okay, it's confirms

04:20:43

Those are non-immune. Criticals they are unless you have ghost touch.

04:20:52

Uh, right, she's not a music. Your criticals when one more word to make that same and accurate. You remember the 19. Unfortunately misses though, but three very solid hits. Yeah, i have no hair appointment so i will i will not be using anything. But uh native figure out how much it's the 19 is the only one misses.

04:21:16

You haven't found a way to include hero points in foundry yet outside of kiwi. Two five nine. Okay, so i take nine points of recoil in the fervent attempt to send this bitch back to the store. I. Well, you definitely just probably drew some aggro. Oh no.

04:21:49

Uh, because she streaks when she sees you and then you pretty much tear her to pieces.

04:22:02

Weird health. Um, and she shrinks and plunges her, or at least attempts to plunge. Her incorial clawed hand into your chest cavity and grab your heart will probably succeed. Kalima he doesn't you don't 16 doesn't hit your touch you see right? Yeah. Yeah, you don't get corrupting touched. I i don't want 45 damage that's why i had to make sure.

04:22:42

It was a standard action not an attack action because she fucking cast blessing of pervert. The start of combat, it's part of her standard tactics and i was like that can't be what they meant, right? Delightful racing. Uh, now it's over 126 plus three damage ghosts close with a lot of hit days because she's a ninth level cleric.

04:23:17

Oh, now she's oh yeah, now she's super dead. Like does she still have the window thing? You do not have ghost edge. So, that first also the crate doesn't happen and she takes half damage from each of them. So this is the the arrows that i dipped earlier, the five that were remaining that wears off after one minute.

04:23:39

So yeah. Okay. The first arrow. Misses the second arrow hits. That's half damage. She's still up the third arrow hits. Does half damage. She is still up the fourth arrow, hits steals half damage. Oh okay. It's not that as she's still up actually.

04:24:05

The quiero also but i miss the key arrow. Yeah, you said fourth arrow but not i dare. Oh, and then i jumped to the hasted arrow because you can only use one of them. You can't bowl.

04:24:23

No, right? Your specifically says, it does sacrifice. Yeah, never mind. She goes down. Do three hba before that. Left the deck and immediately OT is going to stop pointing his sword around and like lay it kind of like flat and down. And put it, put his other hand up to the yetis.

04:24:51

Is she was not a normal ghost because she was created by the morose tearing her soul. From her body regeneration ability. She is utterly destroyed, very slow consumed by the living storms. That dissipates upon her death radical

04:25:16

Yes, not right. So, that was a terrible, terrible storm, spirit, that tricked, our chieftain.

04:25:31

He kind of looks at her husband, like she might forgive him but just sort of leave some unconscious over there. Unsure. Oh, she's gonna go check on him. Coco will shave his blade with a shutter before explaining into the two concerts who we are. Oh, and why we're coming through, why we're here?

04:25:55

Um uh and what we think happened to their husband. And that he should be okay. Now. Yeah, which while that's happening. Oh, she's gonna reach out right next to him and touch koi. I'll be like, give me a hand here. And check on the chieftain. Make sure he's okay.

04:26:18

Chicas stabilize on him and he awakens.

04:26:27

Easy. Big man, bad lying spirit. You'll get those every once in a while.

04:26:39

Do you guys bring nothing to stop her. Thank you for freeing me. So what i do still in your trust, nothing taped out. That was a lot of flood that was pretty scary actually, but i'm fine.

04:27:05

It looks at the floor, which is probably just a lot of books. Are you sure? I will be fine. I think it's very lucky that koi is such an experienced healer. I'm beginning to believe that choir is desna herself but the end of this campaign koya becomes does. This mortal herald?

04:27:25

Yeah. Just, he becomes mythic.

04:27:32

Thank you. I never get the play wrath of the righteous and playing quit. Now.

04:27:40

So we'll just be on our way. We were just passing through. You have rescued me in my kind and you've saved my wives. From the structure, i would give unto you a gift. Please. Take back. There will be fine. I've always wanted a pepper.

04:28:08

If you get a pet raven. Yeah, i have him somewhere on my sheet. Well i have to look up here. What this does ravens i have to look up. Do we really got something special for managing to not kill anyone? Uh, you do. Actually he pulls a dark blue rhomboid, cut stone and offers it to you.

04:28:36

To me, whoever's closest to him sick. That's me. Thanks, i'll take the loop.

04:28:57

Uh and it is in flowless condition. So this ionstone grants you the effects of the alertness speak? Yo.

04:29:09

And this woman who stood with you in a fight, takes a bracelet from her wrist of white. And green jade. I kind of offers it out to you guys a sign of friendship. Soco takes it and bows and appreciation.

04:29:37

Okay, we were very glad that we could help, but these are most welcome gifts.

04:29:46

You have many things. And after they find out and realize that you did that without killing a single yeti, uh, he comes running out after you guys, as you exit the cave, carrying a much larger sack, you did not interested a single person. You got well mentioned before.

04:30:24

But we had no reason to suspect but they weren't just pure evil back then. Oh geez. Just kind of smiling this whole time which is kind of hard to catch because he's a bird. But when this dude comes running out with a bunch of loot for us, he just turns the grace.

04:30:38

And it says, wow, i guess we don't have to just kill everybody all the time. It really pays to be a good person. Oh, it's more fun in there. Nauseous actually gives you a polish and carved stalactites that he uses as a scepter and occasional club inset with 14 pieces of amber worth 100 gold pieces.

04:31:02

Each. And then a large amethyst, geos worth 750. And can you put the the other things that were given to us in there as well? The make sure i didn't like miss here, then like the onions alertness, ion stone and the bracelet. Oh, blue, rom boy and done. Yeah, i will copy and paste those from the other area.

04:31:32

One moment. Yeah. Even though you you showed them to me? I i'm not assuming that no way is adding them to the group loot and can do once we're out of here. It's just not the time to to do housing 21, human tides worth 50.

04:31:57

It's just just like, this is my payment for not going half. This is a it's just grayson and no way counting up all of their jewels and their matching ninja tracksuits and thank you everyone for saying to finish book three. This was actually the very last part of it.

04:32:21

So comments, this side of the mountains, we beat the old man, we beat the dragons and the tower and poor islands and we beat the yetis. We did it and enter the kingdom of hungle.

04:32:48

That is the path of spirit.

04:32:54

I've never looked so forward to not being in the frozen door before my life. Have i not loaded a map of hungle up in there yet. I have not. Okay. Well that actually drags because no none of you are really familiar with hungle yet so thank you a frozen north choco's like okay you all ready for the hard part?

04:33:23

Now, shut the fuck up. Thank you for name-dropping, porn island. By the way that may be really happy.

04:33:35

Boom. And the temperature starts to rise as well as you guys descend from the crown of the world.

04:33:46

So, what's the general like path or taken through hungry? Like are we going to cut their like the the capital? Maybe if they have one, i don't know. You were not gonna be going that south part south into it. You're going to be cutting over through the spirit, the forest of spirits.

04:34:07

Oh, is like the castle is right there. At the end of the pathogen eye, is our an eye, like the city. Is that the capital? Yes. Okay. Aaron. Sorry. I did not realize that was the capital. There is a prince there. I i didn't, i thought he was a like, a minor prince though.

04:34:31

It's, it's like the mongols. It's he's a prince in the same way that what was what was Genghis Khan's name before he became known as Genghis Khan?

04:34:46

Let me get open the other books. I'm sure, i'm sure. I remember i can hire stuff and hagenheim is the the place where you're going. So if that is the capital, then, yes, you are going into the capital. That is where we will be starting next week castle, or do i can have quick question, loot related, so grace.

04:35:11

And please stick around. I thought you were going to ask a different question. No, i have zero experience with iron stones. Um, i just tried to look up that one and i couldn't find a price on one of the srd sites. Can you even sell the best ones, the flawless ones.

04:35:32

And the other side of that question is, has anybody going to take it? Do we all want to try and roll for it or it has none of the important information on it, um, the, the buy price for it is 10 thousand. So the sell price would be five thousand.

04:35:49

Um, i think reason would pass. Yeah, the extra two, the perception for him and not be worth it. Yeah. Um anybody who has ten or more ranks gets the plus four though and we have you for perception. So if you don't want it, it would be cool for somebody else to have versus a thousand to a thousand two hundred 1250 gold pieces for everybody.

04:36:15

When it's i mean it takes up it doesn't take up a slot. So, yeah, and i could get you well, i could give you my iron gone and then you would be the perfect lookout even while worldly sleeping and the screen take the hand slot though. Yeah, i don't think i have any gloves though you're talking about Grayson or no.

04:36:38

You all of that, though. You talking to Grayson or myself, magnus for the gauntlet? I was talking about. You have your acid gloves, right? Yeah, yeah. I don't have hand signs. That's what i'm saying. Like your perception is already so high. I don't think we necessarily need that. So we could get into contact with the most close, the closest uh, chapter of the pathfinders guild and pick up grace in a waystone along with the submitting an application form.

04:37:15

Away finder wayfinder. I mean yeah how that works? Boss. Oh no and the grand lodge is an absolute um oh you have to apply it just walk into a field okay that's not true. You can sometimes just walk into a field allowance to get a field promotion, uh, but it's got to be a good reason.

04:37:39

I don't actually think there is a huge presence of large enough presence for a large here. I would have to actually look up more details on the city right now. I'm trying to get your map up there so i think i have that map because i was going through for the wiki thing.

04:37:56

Let me go look at my thinking real quick. I mean the the bonus perception would help. No way with finding traps.

04:38:09

It would also mean that i don't have to use my eyesop for my eyesight evil. And i can trade it. True. Oh yeah, then no it works. I here we go.

04:38:26

Looks at inventory. Like i have the speckles that i do not used any milk lighting, turn off token vision, all right? Five levels. So, oh, the path of agon hike comes out of this pass here. I just see gray squares.

04:38:52

You don't see this map? No, i don't. You might not be on this this thing. Yes, and i, i don't in my searching for cool stuff. I found this map by the way that somebody made, which i thought was fun.

04:39:16

That is a way you can do that. Most certainly yeah, i'm not seeing anything. I'll try to reload and then or do agony is right here, minkai is over here.

04:39:44

Presumably, this is the epicness forces. It is, in fact, okay, forest it is a big forest and the road of spirits actually runs along the coast instead of going into the forest, because it's scary in there. Makes sense. I bet we go inside it. Yeah, the fastest way through before?

04:40:10

It's always straight through the middle. Did you guys watch the ritual? Because i watched the ritual, i was making another the ritual. What is up? It's a movie. It's a Netflix. Original all of this off. Now, do something a little more lighthearted, but the very first thing that you must do is go to or do agony.

04:40:40

I'm going to put a map in there so you guys can see it. We are going to be doing this, uh, next week by the way.

04:40:51

Dragon. Hi. So that i can do full research on this.

04:41:01

So then now the question that i thought ochi was gonna ask to a level up, that is usually my job. That's actually my next question was at the end of the book. Unfortunately, i closed the book but i'm pretty sure you you. I don't think i'm doing it again.

04:41:23

I do not think we do level up next book, starts up.

04:41:37

Who knows you? Already check. I can, i can tell you what's actually written on the back about i'm at the page now. So doesn't really matter. Hi, everybody before venturing, you should be 10th level at by the adventures end. So yes you go from 9th to 10th level. Oh my evolution has a murderbot has reached.

04:41:59

Its its peak. Oh yeah. Now, i have to make a bunch of choices on both, on my go anywhere. They also sounds like for the next three books. We're not gonna level much at all like me. Yeah. On level per book. Yeah, that's why i didn't think we'd be 10th level.

04:42:17

Yeah, i was like, hmm. There's only going to be like 1.3 levels per book from here on outline. That's oh, let's check out them little region. So it's like two levels. Every every book for me, this one, uh, jade region goes over 16 carry on crown. Only goes 15?

04:42:41

Okay. Yeah, to do this whole thing. It's just the local i get now. Also thieves goes to 13 council fees as the is the one where like it, i thought it was 12 for some reason but you might be 12 that in the last boss battle and then get 13.

04:43:04

Bubbles. Yeah, i think we only hit 12. So i think our jam was kind of like, nope. Now you can help them. Like i'm never gonna play this character again. What are you talking?

04:43:16

This level. I get inspired greatness. Yes, everyone gets the level up. You do not get to do selling. And purchasing yet though, as you are greeted upon breaching or do agony. Oh no. Because you came during the off season and out of a hungry storm that was visible. It just pretty much everyone.

04:43:48

Manual health on d10 is 6, right? Yes, uh it should accurately add it. If it's doing the half numbers, master tricks pasture.

04:44:07

I know i actually need to make a really important decision on this tracking. Yeah, you're straight ninja, aren't you? You got a master tricks. Now that's awesome. Yeah. On the one hand i can do what every other ninja does and become an incredible murderbot. Sure, sure. All i want to do that.

04:44:32

But, i mean, it's it's greater invisibility for 100 rounds of dirt.

04:44:46

I actually a miko gets a couple extra spells per day and that's it.

04:45:05

Let me look it up.

04:45:13

You do. It is a bloodline feet and a bloodline spell.

04:45:27

Period, bloodline heroism. All right. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And maestro bloodline suggestion. All right, that's why she had hiddie's laughter in ventriloquism. I don't remember picking those.

04:45:59

As far as her feet go, she has improved initiative already.

04:46:10

She could take wrote defiance and heroic discovery, but we weren't using

04:46:24

Broke to find for a recovery.

04:46:30

37, girl. And, Big either of those that's pretty good. Magical aptitude.

04:46:44

Persuasive. Persuasive seems like it might be important. Eventually attend nursery is doing very well with those elocution lessons. Yes. Actually he is.

04:47:02

He is an excellent teacher designed in that way.

04:47:08

Intensible cleric russian pilgrim. You already have blessing of the hero.

04:47:34

She's got all work with the little spells. I got those last little actually. All right. They're done. Okay. That was actually easier than i thought. It would be on the one hand. I should really just take invisible blade for vigilante's Hallam but given that literally that last fight, i kind of want to take commie warden.

04:48:04

That's not what i wanted to do, decision paralysis and Anyone else get like something really fun for this bottle. He's inspire goodness. That's cool. Uh yeah, i guess if there's ever an occasion where i need to both one person only. Uh, i mean the good things you keep in mind about greatness is if i remembered correctly.

04:48:32

Great. This is the one that increases your affected with that. Yeah which is real nice for certain things, you know, effects that are raised entirely under character level.

04:49:14

All right, how long does it take us to get from that final battle to the location that we're that? We starting next weekend.

04:49:29

Just because i am very slowly crafting. Something for ochy and see if there's a chance, it might be done, or not. You go how cute including the adventure? Again.

04:50:09

That they're all and hate these.

04:50:34

All the journey two mankaya sarco over. However, now the pieces are finally entering Tianz new dangers of weight.

04:50:45

You must choose the nation of hungle and the haunted force of spirits.

04:50:53

That's not helpful. I actually need a distance. I can figure it out. I've been working on reverse engine. I got it. Okay. Uh, so it's about 120 miles actually from the exit of the path of agony down to ordu. I eigenheim just coming down from the mountains. 120. You say here let me

04:51:28

That's 300 miles. I'm gonna try and duplicate that line best as i can.

04:51:48

Oh, it's about twice the length of that rose.

04:51:59

Oh, there's a draw lipsy's options that i should have been using that entire time. So about that long.

04:52:11

And i want you to be that way.

04:52:22

That's 340 miles.

04:52:30

So then, how many days is it? That we'll have passed. Caravan is 32 miles again doing about three days. You can hustle. Now, the snow is lightning as as you come down from the mountains into hungle, it's more planes area, and less snowy. There's some in the planes because it is still winter.

04:52:52

Okay, so three days but this but this is not like the lands of the norm king's constantly covered in snow.

04:53:05

And then there will be some travel time as you get there.

04:53:19

That's not an ellipses at all, I'll plug on

04:53:32

Okay, i'll get the map sorted out by next by next week. We're getting into book three stuff now and yeah i'm not fully prepared, the answer. All of these questions.

04:53:47

And now i can't get rid of that symbol. All right? I'm gonna go and eat everyone. Have a wonderful evening. I would talk to you, some of you tomorrow. The rest of you next week. Thanks guys. Good fight. I'm here have a good week. Everybody stay safe.
