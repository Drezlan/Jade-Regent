00:03

Because there's a, there's a member of the five storms in there.

00:10

You know, just they just have it in the back.

00:19

I could be more serious about this but it's a slowly coming back to me. We they asked us to go where they told us. They told us they asked um, the one actual art from the book kami. It was like a floating archer guy samurai with no legs. Gave us a little bit of backstory on that.

00:43

They don't know how the, the five storms got out of the house over their blossoms which is where we are now, we went in and we did a lap around the first floor and there were spider people coming up from the ground, like a tunnel through the bottom floor of it and somebody was shadow dancing in and out doing stabs and stuff on us.

01:07

Oh, yeah. Keep the denses break. Amazing. Hook us up with the kami and i was like a bunch of them over the Tori. Gate of all different kinds. And we did some rp and some talking with them. I said the house of leather blossoms. We don't know how they got out.

01:30

We can't go in and they weren't supposed to be able to come out. One of them is still in there, we went in

01:44

We're also asked for a nicely now that i'm remembering by uh by one of the county to specifically find a was it a bonsai and bonsai if we requested that uh a hobgoblin had apparently come by and snatched up the ward of one of the lesser kami. So we've been charged with, by the way, since you're going in.

02:11

Could you please treat it into the back?

02:18

So like sure why not, don't really see how we can say the word. No in this conversation but here we are.

02:49

Went to the pagoda got attacked by a shadow down. So 10 to the figure out turns out places trapped now uh spider creatures.

03:07

Grace is doing his very best tower defense, gameplay and scoring a pentakill.

03:16

Uh, it's about it for my memories. I believe is a quadrical. But yes, now we also have that shadow dancer, leading going up a couple times. You're still up to find a way to deal with her. If you could stick around for five fucking seconds, then i will make sure she bleeds to death.

03:42

She's very good at not doing that though. Mildly infuriating. You.

04:03

Comfortably.

04:11

Oh right. Giant hole in the floor, but there was a giant hole in the glorious. Yeah, that's specifically. Looks like it was made so that you cannot easily scale up or down it. I think that was the enemy.

04:55

And we will get started as soon as he gets back. Mmm, my mr. Typing.

05:21

Yep.

05:45

Okay, i'm back. Sorry, i was grabbing a drink. I'm getting my. Okay, niggas apparently like so welcome back. Um, i'll bet anything that magnes at the same thing that i did, which is that, Arizona doesn't believe a daylight savings. So we've been playing three pm. It's too big. Yeah, that was me several hours ago.

06:28

So a reminder of the floor, you've just arrived on tall. Black lekard screens with printing dragons designs. Turn this corridor into a twisting maze.

06:52

A little, um, i think we're looking at the opening scene.

07:00

We are not on that.

07:17

Quiet. There we go. But okay.

07:31

What i did last time.

07:54

So, which way do you want to go whichever way is for

08:06

Well, clear points down this way and says this boy kind of looks forward, but that way also kind of looks for force.

08:21

Here just gone up and down up or down some stairs. You had just gone up to the second story, though. This looks like it doesn't go anywhere. Actually, i mean yeah no it's first question. Uh, is immediately going to be like, all right, so which one of them has been tracked.

08:39

More than the others. Uh, which is, is me going? Please tell me that i can like survival check for something, please. You can survival check. I, i can't guarantee that i am especially good at it, but i will definitely try it.

09:01

Considering it. I actually do have boost to track. I keep forgetting that.

09:13

Oh yeah, she has more than that. I forget me. Looking at character sheet. No, it'd be like, oh, wait, i'm actually good at this. So you would know that there are more tracks to the north of you.

09:37

There enough. Then we'll keep your lights high. Shut it down. So, let's do love to be in the shadow. Um, feel free to consider that but nobody is keeping an eye out for traps along the way.

10:00

It's the game wants to supposed to be awesome.

10:08

And effectively, she's just going to try and follow that that pattern.

10:19

That.

10:30

Attorney. And,

10:36

That can stay on.

10:45

I can turn that off.

10:56

None of those need to be on. Oh sorry. I still have all my world building modules on. All right, feel free to tinkle with them. Here's a quick question, buff check. What? Buffs would actually still be active right now.

11:16

Um, for the level stuff i would imagine. Yeah, that should be fine. Good hope and bless. Where did that person? Just go. It randomly kicked me down to the first level again and now the game is restarting ago. But it's reloading right now. It seems like maybe, oh, maybe i, i suspect.

11:43

That's because sons is disconnecting a bunch of the, the world building modes, correct?

13:08

There we go. Okay.

13:34

Off the bed.

13:41

You know.

14:21

Don't trust when the console is just blank. There it goes.

15:10

Crying it back in.

15:15

Thumbs up.

15:38

All that. Is that music?

15:59

Just let me know when you don't even configuring him.

16:04

It could be good. Now yes, that feels much better. Okay.

16:31

Um, if the map there for everyone. Yeah. It failed. Floated for me. I would like to apologize from my my lack of punctuality. Okay, i just got 502. Bad gateway.

17:01

The game was literally just green restarted. Uh okay. Okay. Okay, and i just refreshed if the the maps don't appear for me again, i might need to restart the server.

17:22

It's okay. I'm i'm going to neglect to continue my movement until you're in a good spot and everything is okay. There are traps on this floor. I am fairly certain you are capable of finding them, though.

17:41

I know that there's no way that we're getting through a floor of this. That doesn't have traps. I'm convinced at this point, it's spiders, it stands for us. There's gonna be it's going to be sure everywhere. No, i'm sad. Now, i read the, i was reading the world description while i waited.

18:00

And i got to the line where, like, no guest doll. I may do one of those games in the future though and that's not going to happen now.

18:12

I mean dual classes. The thing in tui too. Yeah, but it's not as absurd as guests, all guessed. All this, just for that's for a silly game. That's for, that's for we want to be superheroes and not and not face any trouble at all. Which is a very fun experience for everybody including pm if

18:44

It seems like something that would be fun for like, like, uh, like a quick thing. Like, you know, like two or three sessions.

18:56

Where like the whole gimmick is that you guys are all ridiculously overpowered. I'm here with coya have. Okay, it's gonna turn on a light. Spell, you will want to do that. That's probably a good idea. Do not be me.

19:28

Do you think we're ever going to do the, the goblin adventures? Yeah, we be goblins. I keep hearing great things about those but i've never and i would like to play them.

19:54

Hello. Yes. Went to picture. People are loaded in and happy unloaded and i'm looking at the calendar calendar. Each of the goblin things. It's a, it's a like a one session adventure. Yeah, kind of i honestly have no idea.

20:25

But, uh, i don't know if my voice could handle robeing goblins every single session.

20:34

I'm here. Everything is smooth.

20:40

Every time i come to a fork in the road, i'm just going to say that we're going to check twice the right way at least. The one that gets the most.

20:51

Oh my god, i forgot how many little icons are on. Showcasing. Oh well, we got a lot of busts on us before. We went in here. We did.

21:07

I straight ahead of you.

21:17

Like let me move. Yes. Weird. It's not letting me move is the freshest set of tracks directly to your left is where the most tracks are. I just realized the reason i might not be letting me move was because of lag. Uh, which means the show goes, probably gonna just jitter in place for a while because i tried to move with lunch.

21:40

Probably. Um,

21:48

Yeah. Okay. So is that way that leads down? You say that that's a way. Just the light cuts off. I said, light my vision cuts off here.

22:04

Of that wall is aligned weird, isn't it?

22:21

Yeah. In the interest of being curious, boy is gonna peek around that one.

22:32

When i inevitably get eaten by over look a group. Oh wait a very very old RPG joke. Uh, go into a forest to go left to go right a few times, but if you go in the wrong order, you get eaten by a glue.

22:53

That sounds so familiar.

23:04

No, you see this standing up there and then it kind of lunges out the dark at you.

23:16

And that's really fucking rude.

23:30

What do you erotalki? I see.

23:42

One of the clones, just turns back to you as the is the the other three. Uh, seem to simultaneously draw, draw blade. It's just like again.

24:04

Oh no.

24:14

And because shoco i know is shoko.

24:24

Hmm, where is the monster man? There he is. Kind of like a religion. Check on this fellow. Uh, no not yet. You can't see them. Oh, okay. I just hear shambling and moaning and assume. That's about right. This is going to go. Well. That's how i'm starting with the morgue.

24:53

Huh. We are all initiating right now.

25:23

No, you're rolling through.

25:32

Same here.

25:38

It's a, it's on the combat tracker though. How much there? I just got like five of them at the same time. I'm here. Yeah. Oh god damn. I may go right.

26:06

Um, i can't see it. Where is it? Don't unless you're happy to know what strange thing with a rather large tongue is like one of one of the clones very specifically is like, don't you fucking there? He just steps over here. So someone else can go up there.

26:35

I still have four images left.

26:43

Bringing us to the mortgage turn. Well actually just sort of steps up.

26:56

Oh no. Have i been doing mortgage wrong this whole time? Do they not have to grab you the lick? You, they do not. They just have an attack as i recall.

27:13

It's just one of their options, i would.

27:19

That is terrible. So,

27:27

You get to target my flat footed. Touch chasey. Yeah, good. Yeah. Yep. Uh, so the tongue doesn't do any damage. I don't know why that's in. I just need a fortitude save from you. Uh, you need to roll a one. D4. Find out which of the clones. You lash out.

27:55

Oh, that's fair. One day before and we were having no ab1. Yep. Oops, Ryan A two. Yep. So you see one of the clones like get vaguely touched by this whipping tongue and then just kind of glitches out in place and then evaporates into shadow.

28:27

Hey coco still can't quite see this thing so he just sees a tongue come out of the shadows. Yes. That might actually be enough for knowledge relationship. Actually, morgue tongues are very specific. Uh does it get? It's too flame attacks as well. Is it one of the if it's not classified as a standard action attack, then?

28:54

Yes. It's part of its full attack action. Oh, shoko is very familiar with with the what this is. I you are. And it. Does they, okay?

29:14

Uh, one of those hits but one d3 83 it misses. The other clone just get shredded in half.

29:31

So with what is essentially a 44 on my religion? Check, can i just open up the nephase page onwards? Oh yeah, feel free.

29:44

So you have a baked into your malia. It's just wiki bake. Just opens wiki page. Just like a link to d20 pfsrd just in your religion. Check. Just so several of you might see this happen, uh, this door.

30:06

Wings open.

30:20

Only taking a single and missing. She's not flat-footed.

30:36

But then, the tongue will hit.

30:42

They go is not fucking paralyzed jesus. She does get licked ouchy. You hear something about kenneth, kill it with fire, come out of amiko and tian. It's a little disturbed. Sounding perfect.

31:11

Don't you will five foot step up fast and then do some some standard.

31:28

Evil, uh, yes. Very much so.

31:38

So some attacks on that one.

31:46

Some. Boom. Unfortunately, that will not confirm.

31:59

A mighty hit though and the iterative with them will not hit. Unfortunately, uh, you still took out like a quarter of himself though. Um, and then you think that's gonna be it,

32:25

The button bringing a thin to no way. Uh yeah the second clone the lesson arm now draws it sort of like all right. Okay. Fine. Blender. Those were some baller 2d6s on the holy damage.

32:48

Right. Yes, is my Oh, that's the other one. That doesn't give.

32:59

Okay, we can fix that.

33:04

Problem.

33:32

Um, on the home, dude, in front of you, you do

33:44

He dies after the second attack that is fair. But yeah you uh you see that thing. Get agglycerated. And that is all she can do at that particular. Instant, there's any attempt to five, footstep. It's got.

34:17

Go go. Oh, oh, it didn't it didn't tell me. It was my turn. Oh shit, goes eyes. Widened as he prepares to explain what these things are. Only to see. No way, obliterate one before he could get a single order out. Um any sort of shakes his head and continues?

34:39

Um morgs, the odds. Don't let them lick you. It will they, it will paralyze. You also don't let them kill you, they'll turn you into a zombie. Oh, digital call. I was just thinking about how nice, it'd be to fucking die. Here it already licked me. Wait, there's another one.

35:09

Yeah, i'm trying to call. No way through the lackard panels at the moment. No, there's not another one.

35:22

This is a little awkward, um, Circle will attempt to draw the attention of this one is one of these.

35:57

More go, in probably should have looked at their saves first.

36:05

All right, he locks the gaze with you. I think that's the first time that spells has worked this entire campaign and my turn.

36:22

It's a coastern.

36:37

He can.

36:44

Is anyone injured? Morals. I can't really see anything back here.

37:01

Your tongues don't actually hurt, interestingly enough.

37:12

Fascinating. If it had double move christen,

37:23

Uh probably either seeing or hearing the one that comes up behind coil. Oh yeah, it comes running up behind you. Uh, he's gonna turn and fire at it.

37:58

Each other with and nope. Nope. Actually a 22 misses.

38:16

And that's his turn. So that thing tastes several arrows from you and doesn't go down. I think that's the first time that's ever happened with something.

38:42

Oh my god. Yeah, there. These things are, these things are brick shit houses. They do not go down easy.

39:00

Um, do a concentration check

39:08

She makes it. And then you just see fire erupt on the one in front of amigo.

39:24

Did easily talk by the way. I can't see that anyone in the description, but it says that they command undead armies. So they have to be able to communicate somehow. You don't need to be able to communicate to command the undead. Not in the way that humans communicate. It's also probably things a bit like shadows but they can understand the languages, the life.

40:02

That was minko's turn. That mortgage is dead.

40:15

It's more looks misses even with a touch deck, even if he did make it, she if she has concealment against him right now that that is probably a good thing, boom.

40:49

It is fair. So let's hope for hi on this role. That amigo is not hit by that critical. That's not a high on that role.

41:06

And the second one. Misses her anyways. But she thinks it really solid blow to her torso. And since you are now in Tian, we will playing the rules of watching period pieces. Uh, and she cops up blood for no reason. Just an indicate that she is. In fact, injured, i mean, ironically, i chest like compression if you compress it so much that your rib pierces your own lung, then yes, you would be doing that.

41:40

Yes, but you would also be dead. Um i mean you'd be dead very soon with the amount of blood. Some of these people cough up. They are dead fucking bleach, and it's in a bit surgeries other than coughing up blood and bandages, like same. Same with the i don't know if you ever watched the untamed.

42:06

I love that show. By the way, it's amazing. It's on netflix. If you like chinese boy love drama particularly magical time period ones. The untamed is amazing. Uh, but so much blood blood coughing. Just way too much blood coughing. Let's plug in everyone, cops up blood. Like there's a sip freeze at one point and someone coughs up blood happen.

42:31

Would i be able to swing diagonally through the storeway? Yes, mind will do so

42:48

Boom, boom, boom. I was gonna say, but he gets soft cover, but it doesn't matter.

42:57

Both of those swings. Connect your holy blade. Fizzling flesh off of, uh, sizzling some muscles in you off of its body. I, there's no flesh left. Really beef jerky. Yeah, it's gross. I hate morguards.

43:24

The notes down here about morgs that don't rot and like continue, living as people, but in disguise is kind of interesting. I would do something with that and that will be my turn. That's pretty gross. No way. Oh, this is when you tell, but i have to make it roll to get through it square.

43:51

I mean, yes. Technically, you do have to make an acrobatic role i guess. It's flat footed cmd. Yep. Can't really take an entire opportunity against you though but i guess you can fail it and not move through. Yep. Uh, it also, for whatever reason, put me in the thing.

44:13

So, i'm assuming there's a whole report that i just felt what where are you?

44:21

Elevation when i she does pledging damage.

44:30

Um, 10.

44:39

Luckily, i have just enough movement to do that half speed,

44:48

Why isn't it letting me? Oh, you're okay. I shouldn't have tried to move you.

45:00

There we go. All right.

45:12

You get there without any problems. Excellent. You exceeded its cmd by 10 points.

45:23

Thumbs up. It then proceeds to get slashed but um, It gets slashed. Well, apparently no, i just like sees that one blow and it's just up. No.

45:51

And viciously corrals that wakizashi into its face.

46:02

Yeah, that is the end of the return. Like. Well i, i will, in fact need to be moved because on my screen, i'm still on the wrong floor. I don't know why me on the wrong floor, but it's done that.

46:18

The mortgage create spawn operates off of any killing blow and makes not just its tongue or not, like just like if it kills you all under the effects of its tongue.

46:37

You've got a panel somewhere here, that changes the height difference of the only thing i can think of. I mean, i must because i go to that panel and the game just goes floor.

46:54

There's nothing there though, except a wall.

47:14

Oh wow. I'm just realized that i did in fact confirm about 20 with a 20. Yeah, you're very angry. Uh, it died. She'll go.

47:28

Broker will hear the promotional down here and five foot step down.

47:37

It's not letting me five foot step down.

47:46

I guess i just have to give it a bit. Is having a like moment where you fight with something to, to above koya. Grace is standing there. Yes, yes.

48:07

Recent is invisible to me, which is really weird because no one else is.

48:29

Um, oh okay, none invisible. Graysom you can, what all can i do to help you?

48:51

Can. Can i see the the mortgage? I step over here. No, it's behind a wall. If i do that.

49:04

Um, charcoal is kind of boxed in here. He can't do much. Oh, so i guess i'll just play

49:14

I'll just players around of of rondo, a little late for this, but it's something.

49:32

Everyone talking on haste.

49:37

Okay.

49:55

Here it is. Such a c, got him coil.

50:06

Was that role a 17? I would like, did she create on a

50:27

More concerning. Uh, if you bought your concentration check, do you still fail?

50:40

We just have to hit the DC. Okay.

50:47

Uh, but he only takes half damage so that becomes 18. Unfortunately, he is still up.

51:04

Weird. Does Grayson have some kind of invisibility? Can everyone else? I give them that no special thing on. That would make me invisible. The purple lightning is blinded be specifically dwarves.

51:31

One of those people who doesn't see race but the only race he's specifically doesn't see his tours. Whoa, well thanks for putting that on me. Makes it. Oh, oh, now i could, i, i can now see, grace's token. I cannot see his artwork. I just see a green box.

51:52

A health bar or and his buffs. Your computer does not like the game today. That is weird. Yeah.

52:06

Koi against suplexed. Uh, she takes a blow. It's not that bad christening. What's even funnier, is that i can see the invisible, no way. I can see the outline of you. Why i can see a little faded outline of no way.

52:30

Through currently looks like a rabid wolverine thing. She's not doing her best right now. Grace. And that was unnecessarily violent. I tried to attack. Call ya, everybody.

52:47

Grayson put an arrow each in each ice, socket the mouth and each beard.

52:59

Uh, and rondo because it hurts if we keep going.

53:11

Is everyone? All right, i'm making me look hurt. I am.

53:23

One of her is like rabid angry. The other one is like how, how fix that boy is coming? Okay, well, we need you for this one, those close. If you had a um uh it would have just just don't like me a fucking crap man. Soco danes. Not to tell oniko, what would have happened, if that thing had killed her.

54:00

I was listening when you spoke. It came through a ball.

54:09

Also means these walls, some of these walls are false. Those does not.

54:17

How fun?

54:22

And then clear will channel energy there. You can go and on round here emoji. Always heard all the time mono pochi. There it is sure. Bird up. Whatever works. What can i do to help you? It remains my pleasure.

55:02

Um, i don't i don't appear to have the sensu on my my inventory though. I thought we didn't. We make a sensue for me. Last time essential beam. No, i mean that man. The fan. Yeah.

55:25

I do recall us making it and numbers having the conversation about you needing a weapons chord for it.

55:40

Probably would expand. No way. The tracks. Go straight ahead. A wall through a wall.

55:54

Okay. Oh, not from there. Sorry, straight ahead through here.

56:06

Through a wall. That just swings open goes into the wall kicks. It, some of these lacquered panels are on hinges. I'm trying to move out of your way.

56:32

Don't know why it's still so laggy.

56:40

It just be like that.

56:57

From this is the shipment be like that. Go away. Well.

57:44

So that everybody have a good week just following. Yeah, it's ground to like us halt again.

57:58

Um, i'll explain fun. I've been make them away through and walker post again. Like anyway downtown yeah. We thought that too. Look. Obligated. It's all good. I have to say,

58:20

Whoa, and then a bunch of stuff happened all at once. Yeah, those really fucking weird.

58:44

Going to move. I'm trying so hard to move. It's so it's the lag makes it so difficult.

59:00

I'm gonna grab a snack. Hope you're right back.

59:08

I'm sure.

59:13

Whole point of moving to, this was to get away from this shit. And this is worse than forge ever was. Well, except when we literally couldn't get into forge as this worse than the like your other games from this week.

59:33

I mean, wrath wasn't this bad? It had moments, but it was not not me'll be this.

59:53

There aren't any extra scenes here and i don't think ions had any problems was ayons on this last week. I think.

01:00:10

I don't know what it's not like anything could be burdening. The server too much. There's not a lot in here right now.

01:00:34

And restart the server. Oh, look. It started moving in. Yeah, it's listening. Oh, she stopped mining bitcoin but boom. I imagine at this point, you're you're feeling the the lacquard walls to see which one of them move. Yep, each one of them gets a gets a firm fist like wax it.

01:01:00

Oh, a firm, fifth. Hey, don't don't take my words out of context.

01:01:09

Just sort of sounds like you're, you're punching each of them?

01:01:15

Yes, that is what i meant. There were no other ways that sentence could be taken into account? No, no ways at all especially yeah. It's a special is not kind of hard to read into that. Please don't at least not before. Like, you take me out to dinner first, at least i'm moving right along.

01:01:41

Um, the am i supposed to be able to see weird purple stuff? No, i know. I did not think so. How is that?

01:02:09

Okay? I don't know why that's showing this far down. This is not even on this fucking floor. Amazing. Uh no, that's on floor. Five amazing. You're on floor, too. It's okay. I can see through time. It's fine. Maybe i will just make it invisible until you get that floor.

01:02:34

Okay, i made it invisible. There we go. Um, so uh, was any of this wasn't married this blackard screen, which is open joy and i take it there. Oh joy.

01:02:57

Foxy.

01:03:09

Control thing.

01:03:22

Oh, please come on.

01:03:35

If the encounts are going,

01:03:59

Ability and combat.

01:04:05

That.

01:04:25

Should only be 30.

01:04:34

No, it kicks. Open the door and it's like, ah,

01:04:55

Oh shit. Okay. There was only three, i don't know why i was counting for.

01:05:09

Choco, he was this. I'm here. I'm here, uh,

01:05:18

Uh, initiative initiative.

01:05:32

Still being way too imports. Well, they are fast as fuck. Fuck boy. Five. Footstep. Lickies 17 Mississa. Oh, please. Please don't call it that the keys. I i hate everything about this place.

01:05:58

But i'm pretty positive that 34 hits. Uh and that the 18 misses, yes on mr. Ochi. That is his turn. Here comes another one. Oh, i actually need to go back to this one because we hit you with a slam. Anything to the beach. You're cmd, uh, negative 21, though.

01:06:38

He 24 against attach AC.

01:06:44

I need a fortitude save, so i'm going to spend a result to roll twice. Wherever land is all button is the text is. All right.

01:07:02

That means you need to refresh.

01:07:17

God, you're good. You are enough paralyzed. Both of those success.

01:07:27

I'm gonna put a minus 2 on his attacks as you have cover and those both miss choco. All right, uh,

01:07:45

Particle. Try and get pasta is compatriots.

01:07:54

Um, i assume this is a Grayson that i can't see. No, grayson was behind you. Grace is here.

01:08:18

Oh well if i'm not gonna be so big. Oh, rondo, everyone gets haste.

01:08:57

You know, i'm not sure it should be using this thing like this. Um, like i'm not sure what they belonged effects of repeated repeatedly starting and stopping it within short periods of time. Like this are just the annoyance of everyone else as we keep hearing the the beginning of the song over and over again, i'm pretty sure.

01:09:22

I could replicate the first few notes. Now on a shamizen, thanks to good old princess there but frankly the rest of that fucking song i've got no idea what it is.

01:09:48

You breathe again game.

01:10:04

Thinking about it rationally though. I think it's actually murder on your cardiovascular system. Uh, most definitely, if you're the reason i've got high blood pressure, it's your fucking fault. I'm very disappointed in you.

01:10:24

This is entirely coming from a woman. I don't own nonchalant about this whole thing. Like,

01:10:36

Which at this point appears to be operating independently of now, don't be concerned about it.

01:10:45

So something about uh, shoko and in his box form really gets your blood pumping, huh? Again, dinner first.

01:11:03

Do i have to buy? You dinner, are you going to?

01:11:13

Oh yeah, just got a grin statue. Well, see, now i have to survive. Oh, geez. Gonna pipe up and say we have food out of the Caribbean. Of course, short coast like we have McDonald's at all. That was ochy. It's allergy. Sorry my brain is just like it was too good of a joke.

01:11:42

Well done.

01:11:56

The McDonald's at home is just preserved. Giant slabs of tiger jerky from the giants huts.

01:12:10

I think it might be in the front to several gods and all of the coming, i know. Guess what's right? In front of you, like directly to your left a bird slow head. Turn looks like a shadow, doesn't it?

01:12:34

So, like, like i say, the one of the like, the actual note is still looking at the mogs down here, the shadow clone just slowly turns and goes oh hell no. Um at which point rolled me at 1 d2. Uh, no you stop. You stop the right one. In the clone is multified.

01:13:02

No, that hold on.

01:13:10

And 10 points of backstab, i think? Yeah, so 16

01:13:19

Yep. Okay. Mainly, yeah, that looks good.

01:13:33

Nothing else need to be concerned about. I hate to ask that question but oh there. No, i'm just fixing their sneak attack. Really quick thumbs up because it's gonna happen a lot.

01:14:03

Bringing us to grace and turn lag, please.

01:14:16

There's a grocery store looks like shelters done to me.

01:14:22

Oh, this shirt goes turn. She'll go just rondoed. That's a good point. You did Rhonda. Why you after the family emoji? Begin. I'm trying to drag her to beneath Shoko and it's not working. That would be this roll tap to move forward, but all these spider webs are slowing his movement.

01:14:55

There are a lot of spider webs. Yeah i can't imagine this is particularly girl donna. For me it says it's my turn. So that might also contribute to what about the date?

01:15:11

This is gracious time for me.

01:15:16

Oh gosh. I can see. Can it looks like i can see her. Yeah, you can kind of see it. You can see the sigh in my chest. There's definitely that.

01:15:36

Unfortunately, i currently make one attack but i'll try attacking her. Get them pan. Yeah, lot of thoughts are showing up as explanation points, but at first, i only saw on LA and i just assumed that was her alarm at being staff. You just hear the metal gear solid alarm.

01:15:57

Sounds just,

01:16:03

All right, so the unfortunate thing about the gossamer is only one arrow means she catches it with her sigh and drops it on the ground. Next to her. Oh no, fuck you. Okay. Um, i mean, that's all i can really do because i had to move like third, 20 feet.

01:16:22

So,

01:16:30

Now, in my tracker it says it's an ankles. You might need to refresh.

01:16:39

Um,

01:16:53

We are most definitely going to spend equipment. Even more attacks, the correct answer you a bunch of swings.

01:17:13

Is there any way for me to add an extra attack on the full attack action? Paste. An additional one on top of paste. Uh, nope. You're just gonna have to hit it again. Make it an extra attack. So, there's the one.

01:17:38

And then there's the single for

01:17:44

Tune. The first one. Second third. And the fourth that morgue is still standing. How annoying?

01:18:01

It's got seven each feet but it's still standing and turn button later. So that's my turn. That is very strange. My little hot water at the top. It's still black text.

01:18:24

Uh, no way can't actually not knowing amiko can't actually see anything from there.

01:18:44

Bum bum. So she's gonna cast heroism.

01:18:57

Hold the charge.

01:19:04

And then spring attack touch, no way with it. You can do that. That's terrifying. But he's not actually spring attacking you. She's moving up into then touching you with it before. Going back to her space and i hope i find it accusing

01:19:28

That movement will provoke an attack opportunity, though.

01:19:36

Oh my god, the lag.

01:19:45

Kind of it's like a weird kind of lag as well. That's the

01:19:53

Strange.

01:20:11

Let me go is there.

01:20:28

Yeah, there's more kind of shuffles up. His friends are in the way he can't get to you.

01:20:37

Oh yeah. Also can't get to any of the undead. No way.

01:20:50

Hey, bitch.

01:20:57

Period is seeing sound emitted from behind the mask.

01:21:09

Dancers were supposed to have their shit together.

01:21:30

Boom.

01:21:35

Went into apply the damage. Other damage, please.

01:22:06

So funny thing that 22 wouldn't have had if you hadn't flint, stop hammer,

01:22:19

We just hear peter griffin laugh from the air, where noah was, i i get the distinct impression that you probably still see like this, the stiller manning shadow clone that was like modified. And then the actual no way, vanishes this thing explodes into blood. And it's just like and then bobishes i and when the gossamer goes down in a spray of black blood.

01:22:47

You hear several voices scream in pain and fury echoing through the pagoda. Oh, what did i hurt your fucking feelings? I'm so sorry. All right. I don't think we're gonna catch anything of sleep anymore. Well, i mean, the drums were probably gonna stop that 21g 21 and 25. 25, excuse me.

01:23:22

It does. 42 would save. Por favor.

01:23:33

I wouldn't have been able to make that that extra attack last ride realizing. Now, what was considering doing it? Just halfway. Oh, for the resolve. Yeah. Because it burns an immediate action. So, it wouldn't have my students to stay.

01:24:00

No, that's okay and see how that goes. You are fine.

01:24:27

And then he double slams. Oh jesus, that's a real good.

01:24:39

Uh, first grapple attempt is a 21 fairs second. Gravel attempts is a bunch.

01:24:51

So that's him for the grapple or grappling our couples, what?

01:25:03

Are they skill checks? They are attack rolls. That's my failed fort save there or ability. Now, you are paralyzed for two minutes minutes minutes. I would be concerned if we didn't have a coya.

01:25:35

Therefore is probably i don't actually think playa has to remove paralysis prepared.

01:25:45

You're not a travel domain clerk, right? She is, i forgot about that. Actually, she casts freedom. No, that was a different game. If i was like, that's a different different than the worker. Different doesn't. Wait, does it, does the staff of journeys have freedom movement? It fucking does actually.

01:26:10

Again, i would be concerned if we did not have a Korea, but we have a question. I mean, i would still be kind of concerned uh because now it makes it too slam attacks.

01:26:35

I mean i as a player someone concerned, no way is big, man.

01:26:43

Or we're gonna get zombie bird. It wasn't funny. The first time it happened actually. It was pretty funny, but now it's not stop. Stop. Misconstruct. Me and boom. It did miss the second attack. Oh, my nice crit. On a paralyzed. Ocean on a paralyzed ochi, uh, This look guys, look a got him.

01:27:19

Yeah, great job. Great for so proud of you, the more does in fact pick ochia by the neck and seems to be planning on leaving with shooko, nope.

01:27:38

So, how does movement through allies work here? It's all difficult terrain. Nope. No moving through allies is your normal thing. You just can't stop in the same space. You also can't charge through them, okay? Uh, which of these two squares is a wall. Uh, like like could ice be here and then see all of these guys.

01:28:03

No, no, no. And no ways in my way if i want to do that. Uh,

01:28:16

Well, isn't this slightly bothersome uh

01:28:23

Joke was gonna whip out his agile wave blade from the uh of the scabbard of bigger and give it the, i believe it's plus two for four or three, two ounce, something like that. Wait, let me look real quick. Let's get rid of bigger.

01:28:50

What? Let's work for one round plus three plus three for three rounds.

01:29:16

And one of these is looking like real fucked up, right? If your shirts kind of hard to tell uh ochi is still technically in that spot. Actually can't stand there.

01:29:33

Well then i guess i don't take the thing out of my scap room because there's no point. You've also being held but yeah, that's fine. You can be there.

01:29:47

Oh, she is small. Yeah. Oh, circle will run up and

01:29:59

Attack. Roll bonus. Three damage bonus plus three.

01:30:13

And i don't get a haste attack, do i? No, you have to full attack to do that. So you moved, okay.

01:30:39

I mean, we're doing.

01:30:45

You cut that more down.

01:30:52

All right. Hopefully that opens up room for one of you guys to get in here. Oh shoot, i will end my turn.

01:31:11

He's important.

01:31:24

Are you just stopped on ecology? Oh, i can think about is i made my girlfriend watch missing forward one down two. I don't know if anybody's familiar but there was a story of like these 14 like Guatemala workers up in like a national forest logging area clearing out an area and they watch a ufo come and pick up an elk paralyzed.

01:31:48

As soon as it got beat or whatever and just like for like sticking out carrying away by this uniform which bumped into a tree and that's OG right now, he's completely silent and unmoving just arms. Still out gonna get carried away. Taxidermy to ochi on Grayson's. Turn the the spaces are a little confusing.

01:32:17

Now what what space could grace and move to be able to reach out and touch ochi. Uh, this square is technically empty.

01:32:33

Okay, grace. It'll try to move there.

01:32:39

You should assume you will be acrobatic thing.

01:32:48

Um, No.

01:32:58

Because the one that's holding ochi his tongue is busy. I think is not only his claws. Uh, okay. Well, he misses a 29 minutes. Is your touch AC? Oh it's touch. Um, yeah, that hits fourth to save. You're a dwarf though. I expect you to to make this. You're fine.

01:33:24

Continue. Uh, and he will reach out and touch ochi and use a spell like ability.

01:33:37

To remove the paralyzed condition. Well, technically suppress it for 10 minutes. Okay, we have a slight problem here now. Yeah. So i'm gonna rule that shoko gets pushed back one and OT goes back into his original space. Social gets posted to no way. Boom. So she'll go kids pushed either here or here.

01:34:11

One of the other. Those are your closest open spaces. Oh, the one where the gospel was works.

01:34:27

And then as soon as OG gets unparalized, he goes grace it. Oh oh, you're here. Thank you. And i got your back coaches. All right, and that is gracious here. And now it's ocean your hair done. Yeah, i think technically they're already dead. You know what i mean?

01:34:59

Well, it depends on what school of thought you go by. Like it's it's something that people talk about a lot showcas starts on like a but like a tangent. Oh, gee is going to do a bunch of attacks on the one that paralyzed.

01:35:16

Oh, my door dash is here. I will be right back. Oh, the head and hit and that and myth.

01:35:31

And then oh, gee is going to five foot step back.

01:35:39

Oh no, i can't. No, he's there. That's right, that is correct. You're fairly son, you ought to sound but may have been nice. Slapping her own set of clone at this junk. Like, what the fuck is wrong with me?

01:36:11

Uh, yeah, so ocean in 10 minutes, you're going to get paralyzed again. So presses. It, the duration of the abilities no longer running. I thought they would be concurrent for this. I think it's depends on the thing, but this one specifically says, it just pauses it. Yeah, the fact that they calls it a temporary cease means that.

01:36:36

It's they do not. Yep. If the affliction are condition, has a duration. It is suspended until the spell expires.

01:36:47

But by uh by then koya should be able to fix you of that. It's just super crowded up here right now, and no way can't actually see anything to get into in there. Again, let me go get

01:37:08

Amiko cannot, she can't even draw line of sight to the morgue.

01:37:22

Oh, she is just gonna get out of the way. It's super lagging again. Why?

01:37:44

Maybe dumb to ask at this point, but the paralyzed condition needs suppressed. That automatically got me out of being grappled.

01:37:56

Uh, no. Actually, you would still be grappled changes, a lot of things. What do you mean? Well, could i have made my attacks on it? If i was grappled, yes, at a minus two. Oh, fair point. Hold on 200 weapon again. One-handed. Oh, is it? Yeah, i usually i always been using two-handed ever since i got this.

01:38:31

The sword and you wield katana one-handed. Yep. Do you have the proficiency am? Because warrior poet? I am legitimately both mean to you. I want to say no worries. Yeah. It's a weird proficiency that ninja gives you katana. Okay, so we're just gonna put his hp back to max a year.

01:38:56

Gonna those one-handed a minus 2. Okay.

01:39:12

You are still grappled though.

01:39:32

I've actually came out better.

01:39:39

It did come out a lot better, actually.

01:39:53

Good.

01:39:57

Oh, not a lot better. You ended up doing 10 more damage.

01:40:09

All right, someone is finally in a square. He can kind of target. Grayson a tongue reaches round the corner. Oh no. I deleted him control z. Uh, if the 16 is the attack roll, that's a mythical against touch. That was a joke.

01:40:43

Okay, i'm gonna roll the slam attacks from the other, dude.

01:40:53

It's back. It is back control. Z worked. Against normal EC, then they both miss. Okay.

01:41:11

Now is coyote turn.

01:41:21

Grappled automatically, it did.

01:41:31

Incoming general energy.

01:41:36

No way to heal or harm. Thank you. Favorite.

01:41:48

Now come to the harm.

01:41:53

Oh no, she moved. She can't do that. Yeah.

01:42:01

Sorry, please continue. All right.

01:42:10

Again, well the good news is i can't see that one and need to be any further than this.

01:42:22

Who cares that i'm firing into melee?

01:42:29

Who fucking cares?

01:42:40

That's what the negative four included. If you need further penalties for cover and whatever. Nope, the first one takes him down. He had ADHV left. Oh, just the first one. Yep.

01:43:01

All right, that's the case. Oh, hey friend. Yeah, we're just gonna try and get through your square and not to be in the way and avoid this entire this entire thing, 31, to get through flat forwards, the ended carry on,

01:43:33

There are enough research in the wall.

01:43:39

Uh, dead morgue shoko.

01:43:51

Oh, and the Wakazaki on the floor, i probably should have mentioned that, that you're walking dashi. Uh, one of them dropped in order to deal with that. Yep.

01:44:21

I'm trying. I'm really trying. It's, it's slow going but i'm trying to get over there. You're all right. Fine. Is there a no way in this spot? There's not. Okay, broco will Attempt acrobatics.

01:44:50

Hey.

01:45:06

The 27 in touch JC. Oh well, that's a high CMD. Roll me one d5.

01:45:23

One clone of shoko evaporates in a puff of fox fire.

01:45:46

On our tech world, that is the tech world.

01:46:07

It did go through. Oh, there we go. Okay. We go, and i confirms

01:46:21

You stabbed this morgue as he tries to lick you.

01:46:29

End of turn. Great in.

01:46:39

Oh, that's a little get ready. He will not spend the extra key for an extra era though.

01:46:50

Oh, it's really terrible attack rolls. I don't think any of those hit. Oh wow. Uh, they do not

01:47:04

That's his turn. Oh, g first

01:47:22

205, let's have next decorative and that'll be my turn is in a way right there, in that space.

01:47:33

You see a wakazashi on the floor but uh,

01:47:45

All right, booted.

01:47:57

That was my fault. I didn't think that was gonna do a reset, it didn't even give me a warning that it was gonna do a reset.

01:48:21

I don't see what you're talking about.

01:48:28

It's not like the game reset for me.

01:48:34

It hasn't. Oh no, it hasn't but i just realized that i might just be my internet again. So usually when it is resets for me, it does resets for everyone, it did reset from me, i will very quickly bear attack.

01:49:19

We're at about break time now, so let's pause here. Anyways, and i'm gonna restart the

01:49:37

So big break everyone. Go potties.

01:50:26

Hello.

01:50:32

Nobody's playing the stuff from, like, even one batch ago in 14, i spent 90 minutes left yesterday. Trying to get people to play up to a storms crown with and nobody would show up. This is a good reason for that. Stomps crown is. Um, did you do it in the end now?

01:50:58

Okay.

01:51:03

It's not a fun one. I think it's fun, but i'm also like good.

01:51:18

Um, phase two uh man mean shades of alluded to uh excuse to be able to monkey bread. Like you know your rotation enough that if we start throwing things at you with like split second indicators, you're going to be able to dodge it and keep doing your job. At least that's how it feels for mellor.

01:51:46

Which i find very entertaining.

01:51:52

Bobby gives zero fox and i very much enjoy it.

01:52:08

Go to place and fight. Big naked green. Wind lady. No, not that one. The other one to be fair. Two barbie. She is kind of a staple comes with the territory of being one of the four scenes, you know,

01:52:33

That was not expecting the rendition of her that we got, but i enjoy it.

01:52:54

I should actually play ff4 at some point. Probably should have played it before. I started then walker. Honestly, it's all right.

01:53:07

People people do like it really breaks in like people's absolute favorite, but it is a classic.

01:53:30

Yeah. Why is this soy sauce chunky? Is it actually? I don't know. Fucking yakitori's awesomes or something else that it might be anything of it.

01:53:50

If it's chunky with sesame garlic, that's fine. If it is not, uh, do not eat. I'm gonna eat it anyway.

01:54:06

That's a spirit.

01:54:29

When i made the mistake of thinking zero was going to be the reaper class trend. You were like, no, she's something very different. I was not expecting this much very different. I really, i really like zero. She's great, she's fantastic. I love her. She's, she's pretty great. Have you?

01:54:53

I forget exactly where you're at of.

01:57:00

Nearly two words in this is what it's like to be known as dead for real.

01:57:33

What's wrong? What is it? Oh, i love being a woman. Oh wow. Like, you're actually like, i mean you're

01:57:49

You know what's been a while since I've done a kid makeup like this. So i just felt like reminding you all that. I can look like this anytime i want and there's nothing you can do about it.

01:58:19

Wrong hydration.

01:59:08

My favorite heart to catcher told me bad it was declined. A screamers to your business, are you? It really does bother people. Think i'm just fucking sex god in LA and i fuck all these people because i i mean i can't remember the last time. It's how long has it been here?

01:59:32

And it was slogan. Are you exciting? It really does anything on this fucking sex doll when world's collide should be the cash. I'll be the rubber band. Okay? If to be the king,

02:00:44

14, uh, not food or blood. I am very behind on them.

02:00:53

Then we want, we won't.

02:00:59

I am returned. Welcome back. Are you shimkas i have no idea. Probably if you're talking about start playing, i don't remember. I am. Okay, i'd someone joined the game and i was like it's this game publicly listed. Who the fuck is this? And then i forgot that i had told you you were at the time to join now.

02:01:22

Yeah. And i, i don't think i even chose that username. I think it just gave me one. That's weird.

02:01:35

And being extremely nutty and finding out what elements of everything for like actually taking. So fucking what do you think? And it seems to be entirely your jQuery. I have no idea what that is.

02:02:00

So,

02:02:06

Basically, um,

02:02:14

It's supposed to be a way for it to perfect polite, the HTML and XML event handling, which is only something you need to care about in so far. That like the back end of boundary is like a bunch of jason, right? Right. So, for whatever reason become, like the specific processing for your, your jQuery library is just i'm not even, i'm not even gonna say.

02:02:46

I'm i'm just gonna show you.

02:03:19

Yellow means waiting.

02:03:27

It's a lot of waiting and they all goes all starts in the very base verse game file.

02:03:42

So it looks like it's hiccuping on scripts, pretty hard.

02:04:26

And then for whatever reason like it takes a bunch of times specifically, just tell the load. It's actually, it doesn't take time. That's, that's a lie. It doesn't actually take and whatsoever to load in the fonts that it just takes a long time to receive it. I don't know why, it's very funny.

02:04:48

Like it's it's literally like, no kilobytes. So it doesn't matter. But perfect.

02:05:07

Huh. That actually matches what i'm reading in my console right now. It's literally tripping up on scripts somewhere.

02:05:22

I just need to know.

02:05:30

Theme packer.

02:05:55

Here we go.

02:06:04

Hey, i'm gonna ask some questions of the people that molten hosting over the next few days. See if i can figure out a way to fix that.

02:06:22

Is music coming off emoji.

02:06:29

Yeah, there's a pulse of an animation musical score. It looks like that's a pretty cool looking animation. Oh my god, just noticed that. Oh, that's the it's your turn thing that's for it. Just happened when i did the the reset. I wanted to see the new border and the last time i changed it, it didn't do a reset.

02:06:56

But this time it did.

02:07:06

Yeah, that's the current, it's your turn thing.

02:07:18

Unpause the game and so ochi, oh it's actually what she's turn. I reload it again. Grayson is with us. Yep. Come here and spirit and body.

02:07:52

Oh, that's pretty fast, load. Perfect. Yeah, see it held us talking shit. And that's usually what gets serviced to respond in my experience if they figure out how i was doing. It sequoia and didn't have much else going on. I don't think is no way occupying, the space and i'm in, by chance.

02:08:25

Do i run into her? Nope, when i'm just going to stand next to koya and just put out my hands and say please may I have some more healing.

02:08:39

On hurricane. Yes. And that's yeah, just trying to make some room die. All that good stuff. I have an intern button. Amazing on ironically like amazing.

02:09:11

Still says paused.

02:09:17

No, not anymore and get a herois emoji.

02:09:31

Feel heroic or something. She'll go a 15 to hit the outside. AC that will miss. There we go.

02:09:44

And the double slams.

02:09:52

Uh the 24 misses the 28, also misses but it smacks clone

02:10:04

Uh, you still have total defense on for some reason.

02:10:13

Might be okay. Uh, so i was like, there's no way your ac is a 30. Yeah. Uh okay. So does the tongue dispatch a clone? Does it does it does a non-damaging it. It is. So the tongue gets rid of a clone little slam gets rid of a clone, and the second slam will have to roll a d3 to see if it hits me.

02:10:45

It's me. It's you, you take 12, you're not grab bold unless the 20 beats your CMD. It does not boy. Yeah. Yes. Grandson. You may have some healing.

02:11:18

And then suddenly it's moving at the speed of light. Jesus, no way i'm down for this. All right. So, uh, which which one of my weapons did i drop? I actually said. Oh okay. So, i actually, uh, what kizashi i did, but i have two walkers. You do. Indeed.

02:11:40

Makes no difference for this encounter, but it is important.

02:11:46

Because, uh,

02:11:56

This is a hit. This is a hit. This is the head. Um, where did i just apply? All that damage to

02:12:14

Has no natural armor left.

02:12:25

Oh, we've only it. Could bleed unless it cannot so she punches it through the goddamn throats.

02:12:39

Uh and damn near kills it too. Still up. Wait, barely. No, it's not.

02:12:51

Guess who else can also do the thing?

02:13:02

And don't i go. So like this invisible fist goes into its jaw cracks its jaw. Realizes those just is that so just continues backing it in until it becomes wonderful wall. We can go with that. That's pretty horrifying. Very elephant. Elephant lied. Open that i don't think i ever knew how to pronounce the name of that show.

02:13:29

I always had lead of elephant line memory unlocked. Yeah, not what i was going for, but sure. Sure, if we can, we can go for that mental image, uh, blazing Rondo ends and we are all of fatigued because it was more than three rounds. I was gonna ask because i felt like we were right there.

02:13:57

Was it okay? We can say, it wasn't.

02:14:03

I felt like it was i thought of the story.

02:14:12

Yeah, i'm in remember what i just said about cardiovascular systems. There's nothing back here. Boom. There is this lekard screen easily moved on a hinge.

02:14:40

And someone passed me my sword, please.

02:14:50

The, the boss, the, the haze falls off. Unless oh, she does this before unless unless, oh, she opens the store and something obviously attacks us before. It gets around Ashoka's turn in the ends. With off, you will end the buff.

02:15:11

We're going with we don't get the team. Yeah.

02:15:22

Everything to have stopped again, it has solved for me as well.

02:15:36

So, what are we feed for a small period of time? We are not, you know,

02:15:46

That is a door that i didn't actually, but a door on.

02:15:58

The door actually east door and how trapped is the door and how is it going to kill me?

02:16:25

All of our sanity. 40, previous. One second.

02:16:40

I had my console open that time when the leg started and it holds me. What module is interfering? Let's go ahead and turn off the enhanced terrain layer because all that really does is let me make direct difficult terrain.

02:17:17

Hopefully, hopefully.

02:17:25

Month, little details. Why are you having issues?

02:18:05

The only thing i can think of to fix these errors, if they keep popping up and all these modules is going out and getting all the modules out of the game and then reinstalling them and hope that they correct their own pathway issues.

02:18:25

And that sounds like a lot of boring computer work. I don't like doing.

02:18:35

That's, i will strip this game down towards base score. If i need to,

02:18:42

I like this game too much.

02:19:26

Things. Let me back into the game.

02:20:18

And knowing what is your perception check at currently?

02:20:29

Post something bigger than the 19. Yes. All right. You can't not spot the traps then that are just on the inside of the store. Uh, there are none on the door itself but just inside. Uh, like the several squares immediately follow, or a bunch of slits in the ground that all seem to have blades in them, that snap upward and not like child choppy blades, like dagger size blade.

02:21:16

Oh, that's actually kind of cool.

02:21:25

That that is not looking. Um, that is terrible and very painful and should probably be dealt with. To the question i have is, is that connected to the door? Or is that like a pressure plating pool? It looks like it's a remote trigger. Actually isn't now like you see a chain leading off from one of the the switches inside?

02:21:52

The can i theoretically trace the chain?

02:22:03

It probably goes up somewhere likely through the nearby wall which leads you to look up closer at the ceilings and you see great in the ceiling where it looks like people have been able to look down at you the whole time.

02:22:34

I wonder if that's what the screaming was.

02:22:50

So so they are like this entire 10 foot section right here, entire 10 foot section,

02:23:04

And dismantling it. As in like smacking the floor, find living in a working them out, is not an option. I mean, you could probably just play, open one of the wooden panels right here and cut the, the pull cord, so that it can't be triggered. Yep. Pretty much what she's gonna do?

02:23:26

Yeah. Uh, what's your disable device? Ah, versus traps. I suppose you could fail, you could watch. And what i my bonus is a 30, something.

02:23:45

Yeah at work. You could just jam it but no here, you're fine. Can you completely disable it? Like she could neatly pick up the the thing and like to explore. No, you see? No, i just punched through the fucking ground and just grip out of according like i should do it.

02:24:07

But is keeping a a keen eye up on the ceiling now like that is unnerving. How high are the ceilings? 20 feet, 20 feet up there. Okay.

02:24:26

Oh okay. You are still pretty fucked up. Don't mind me. Oh, she's happy.

02:24:45

Thank you. Well, she scuttles away.

02:24:51

I'm only hearing the oh yeah. Zoidbergs dr. Koya. Um, all right. Which, which way leads further into i get the distinct impression that we want to go into the middle of this place. Does that seems to be where we're going? Uh, i can't seem to select. No. I make those token things or not working well, right now.

02:25:29

What is happening?

02:25:40

Take these four packages terrain. Ruler lib wrapper, drag ruler monks active tiles. There aren't any active tiles on this.

02:26:15

Okay, i'm gonna have to turn those off to

02:26:31

Okay.

02:26:59

Sorry if that resets for you guys again. But i turned off all four of the modules that came back for the failures.

02:27:30

Uh gavin that cat's name is richard. Ah, yes.

02:27:42

A very serious name for a very serious cat.

02:27:50

How do you get dick out of richard? You have nicely.

02:27:59

He also take them to see. This is the joke.

02:28:37

This pagoda will be okay. It will, this is this is the true terror of the temple of wilted blossoms. The fucking lag. The house of world blossom is like made a packed fucking shaka or some shit. The reason the only like there wasn't there weren't actually any like uh protections in place to keep the Oni contained.

02:29:06

They could just only take like one step every like 10 years and that's why i took them so long to get out pieces.

02:29:18

Though that's uh it's not a bad idea.

02:29:32

And now i'm just getting a bad gateway.

02:29:42

Restart foundry. Not the server just foundry. Thank you.

02:30:34

This is so ridiculous. I put so much work into this dungeon. I literally built it completely from scratch and it is actually pretty cool. It's just a shame that the server is being non-compliant to you.

02:31:08

I will be right back.

02:31:17

And then almost we might be going back to forge if this isn't sustainable and i will just have to be more active about removing things from games in the forage after they've been used.

02:31:40

Maybe cut back on some of the automation.

02:32:29

It's a good joint screen.

02:33:47

Anyone actually in the game yet, you know, i just clicked reload to see if it would do anything. I got 502 kind of him and everything's blink and nothing is loaded. Oh, i'm looking at the brown wall legacy. Let's see if i can log in.

02:34:46

Yeah, i got brainwall legacy too. Just no login. Yeah, same here. It's still not popping up for me.

02:35:25

Leave this bit is absurd this. I don't and i don't understand what's happening.

02:36:13

Well, i will be right back. I didn't get a drink.

02:36:31

Oh, the login just popped up for me. Yay.

02:36:38

All right, i've clicked join game session.

02:36:44

Login, as magnet successful joining game,

02:36:52

You can probably still go get your drink because i have done graded to just blank purple screen. Okay.

02:37:47

Oh shit, thanks a lot happening. There it goes, there it goes.

02:38:32

Wait, here i go. Here i go.

02:39:01

I have returned to a 504 gateway, timeout.

02:39:10

That's fun.

02:39:35

I'm halfway in see an Abby in here.

02:39:43

I'm glad you do.

02:39:59

Now, i'm suddenly getting the feeling that this might not be molten hosting bald, how's it?

02:40:17

I i think it might have something to do with the way. I transferred my games. I am in two purple screen land so i am gonna go and remove all of the old module from inside the game, folders and then reinstall them through foundry attached to molten hosting.

02:40:47

But i had to do with the cards for the magnificent magenta because they're trying to cards from my forge folder.

02:41:00

Which no longer existed here.

02:41:14

I seem to be kind of running. I see several other people have joined me.

02:41:23

I see purple screen.

02:41:29

I think we should name it. The purple screen of false hope. I don't think that would be grossly and accurate, honestly.

02:41:47

It says, yes, it's like every mud has an error.

02:41:56

Weather effects is having errors, it's not even in use right now.

02:42:08

I'm gonna do spring cleaning of the game tonight after

02:42:20

Haha. No, he moved. I can do stuff. It's pretty great.

02:42:32

It's it's pretty awesome. I think it's quite nice and then i spoke too soon. Well, the game is pause. Now. No, it's not.

02:42:59

Uh, i see a purple screen and game paused. Oh, music just came in. What about now game is no longer passed.

02:43:14

But still purple.

02:43:37

Whether fx?

02:43:51

And monks token bar, huh?

02:44:09

It is taking it sweet ass time. Processing these things.

02:44:20

There's something something. Just shut choko out.

02:45:30

Is everything seems to be working for everyone now very strong sentence. I just say, darkness.

02:45:43

I was able to move pretty continuously there.

02:45:57

I say errors. Not happening anymore. Nope, there we go. Now it's slowed down again and what caused that? Exactly what the fuck do you mean a blow gun had an issue?

02:46:17

The blogun png. No less.

02:46:26

Dude watching, this console is wild.

02:47:08

What's weird is like, he still keeps seeing everybody moving like five feet at a time. So strange.

02:47:40

No way, this way is not traveled at all. Most of the floorboards here. Look completely covered in dust. Well, when my game decides to like, not crash on me, really

02:48:06

To what that tells me is that this is either. What am i saying fucking feeling?

02:48:19

That or i'm going to be attacked by and then that's a fun. Don't actually see any of those vents over here either.

02:48:35

And now it's me really sauce. Come along everyone. Keep.

02:48:48

Interesting. And all of the walls are solid. None of these ones move, it's not strange.

02:49:00

Shouldn't always follow the strange. And then,

02:49:08

No, i slaps like her own club, like, don't worry about it, cooks. Ignore her. I'm saying shadow still. I just a big black screen. It's okay because it's going to freeze again. So you're right. Yeah, it was, it was working too. Well, there for a second. It was working too.

02:49:30

Well, there for a second. Oh, look at all of these errors in the console again but now it says no packages detected. Oh and weather effects and error retrieving wildcard koya and

02:49:51

I'm sorry. I ever said anything bad about you forge, will you please take us back?

02:50:01

My new boyfriend is much meaner to me than you everywhere.

02:50:10

That's pretty fucked up.

02:50:18

Yeah, it might mean more organizational work for me, but we might be going back to forge.

02:50:35

I was really urge server that we could use that just works.

02:50:44

I mean i could do some research but this one was supposed to work just fine and it might be, suppose is trying to pull too much information from full. Don't exist them today. And tomorrow night and see if you can get this. Fix is it? Because Abby is british.

02:51:05

Is that why it hates us? No. It's because of things, i think like you and koya. Both trying to pull multiple images from a pile directory that doesn't exist anymore. Hmm, and the scripts on your character, sheets are telling the system every time you click on their sheets, to look for them.

02:51:32

And the weather effects is trying to do the same thing. I think i just need to get the modules out of the base game world and then reinstall them from outside. So, we're gonna do this last bit, completely bare bones, theater of the mine. Let's go. No. I mean, i'm gonna turn off active token effects.

02:51:59

Advanced macros ambient doors and find our theater. The mine sounds like an absolute nightmare. Turn off weather effects heartbeat image. Hover. Hey, those can stay. It's fucking in turn. Play do not play 3.5 adjacent systems and theater. The bind play fucking force. Those two, we work in theater.

02:52:41

I haven't tried it in theater of the mind yet. Oh, you mean 500 to it? Yeah. Uh, probably better than first edition does. Because although movement is like it is important to regulate it and stuff, but very few things have uh the stuff like a tackable.

02:53:13

Okay, you need the rest of that. Everything else? Fuck off?

02:53:29

It's having such an issue pulling up images. All of these are pmg's and web piece.

02:53:39

So it's tripping on image files for some reason.

02:53:49

Heavy, any ideas?

02:53:55

I don't think it is. I think the images are a subsequent zero. Two bad gateway indicates, i couldn't connect to the origin server.

02:54:15

So this means we're having super issues staying connected to the server. Yep, which means the server is now having the same problems that forge had like three weeks ago, which is what's recent. I left it.

02:54:33

Like,

02:54:42

Let me relax. I'm trying to hold.

02:54:52

I'm gonna test. It is the same hub.

02:55:03

Stands is a weird to call it francisco. My brother looked at me like it was an absolute freak when i said that he's like nobody calls it that never even been there. So i couldn't say, uh, francisco sounds like a character name, do you mean Francisco? Because nobody don't know calls it.

02:55:29

That Okay, you could do sf. You could do frisco. I've heard frisco many times, how was frisco, okay? But not francisco. Well, because frisco kind of rolls off the tongue a little easier and it sounds like frisky. And this is america look. All i know is that like my my works data centers crawled after different cities and various provinces, right?

02:56:07

Yeah. So we have one of our major data centers called new york. Native one is called san francisco. Hey no. Errors on this load, actually.

02:56:21

They're going loading back in. I will click the little circle arrow.

02:56:36

I'm a bitch. Close to meiosis it. Bulge to me, your secrets.

02:56:52

Lagging on movements, why? No packages detected.

02:57:09

Just super legging on movement, huh?

02:57:19

But why is coyote's movement so slow?

02:57:30

Oh, because it thinks you're flying because of the buff.

02:58:04

I am back in.

02:58:11

I'm currently on the brain wall screen waiting for the login ui to pop up things, loading purple.

02:58:24

The, the text boxes have loaded in still purple.

02:58:38

Getting my hopes up. The map is back. I'm in.

02:58:45

I'm now on the gray screen before the purple screen like that. We all know the stages of these screens. It's awful. Uh, okay. I am in. Yeah, and i'm worried about how strong this only of the five storms is if this is her tax against us.

02:59:16

Rockers celebration. I still can't move. Five feet, though, same. Let me know. Look, it's it's we can ask too much of it. Okay, we should be able to ask basic functionality of it though.

02:59:43

Like i've done, i've shut up most of the module. Is there any chance that the reason like it's doing this? Like is because it's, like, multiple people asking things of the system once, like, if nobody else clicked, anything and just one of us tried to move our characters, like at a time.

03:00:03

Would that do anything without help at all?

03:00:09

What about the the layered map? And the fact that we're okay listed as different floors and such, that's not exactly resource intensive.

03:00:26

All right. Everyone is moving now on my screen after just finished another round of loads.

03:00:45

Oh, that's fun. And then it's stopped again. Yeah. It's um,

03:01:25

It's ridiculous. This is.

03:01:34

It has decidedly gotten worse. As time has gone on to

03:01:43

Like we have would what? What's having like really shitty connection? Do anything about this? Like like would it drive this level? It shouldn't especially since it's set up to those. You guys can connect on your own. You shouldn't be able to affect other people.

03:02:15

There anything else? I can turn off? I can turn off the hood that seems to be. So, anyways, this picture of Richard as inspired Japan. So, we have fun, right? They have three cats at my mom's house, but no dogs since my dog died. Two plus years ago now.

03:02:45

And so, my mom and my sister decided to get another dog and the dog's name is pretzel. That's a cute name. That is pretty cute. Lab. Only lab main pretzel.

03:03:04

Uh, for everyone that's on start playing. Now, it's gonna say that next week has been canceled. It's not. I'm just giving you a free session next week for this, uh, and we will either be transferred back to forage. Or i will have found a way to fix by next week.

03:03:36

But i have turned every single module off now and i'm still getting error. Aborted 502. So it's not the modules causing. That's that's awesome, right? That's awesome, that's cool. That is awesome.

03:03:58

If it tick tock sound right now, that's awesome, that's awesome.

03:04:31

Fuck my life.

03:04:37

I'll have to reload the worlds onto the forge.

03:05:14

What do you mean game is not defined?

03:05:20

Two-way board kit.

03:05:29

This, this is what i'm looking at.

03:05:45

We're on my screenshots.

03:06:10

And then it just stops loading after that. That is 10 thousand percent. Your hostel? That is that is your host. You know what? Well, it needs to stop it, it really do. Well, it needs to start to be fair. Yeah.

03:06:33

And then just immediately started this time around when i read. What the fuck? Magic. Yeah, i would.

03:07:28

Colors.

03:07:39

People, if you're having inspiration, please include the following server name. World name description of the issue.

03:08:30

Oh, i feel like i was sold. Snake oil.

03:08:38

Um, why is that? Well, because i just joined molten hosting discord server of which they're only about a thousand members and uh, one person working

03:08:57

So this server is in some dude's basements in like Croatia. Here's what you're telling me, no pieces. He's in the u.s central time zone. I well, actually, so maybe he could be pretty selfless.

03:09:21

Yes, i will be looking for a different third party server hosting then because i do still think this is probably the best bet just maybe not molten hosting

03:09:49

Yeah, they came in clear rooms.

03:09:59

And almost be tempted to to tell you to just like run an AWS at this point. The, the reason i wanted to do a cloud hosted server was because i don't think my computer could handle a cell posted server. Oh yeah. I i don't doubt that. That's why i'm like yeah.

03:10:20

I just just getting EC2 on aws. I don't know what that is, then amazon amazon. You you could just have like a single a single thing that you're like an application host that you're doing. They are, they're pretty good. There's two problems with it, though. Um, the the first one is uh they're pricing, can be uh obnoxiously opaque.

03:10:57

Um, then would require some digging in those was an option. The other one is i have no idea how you deploy found it because anything about it because i couldn't help you that. But like if it's just a, just a cloud-based web, host your native. I can just get fucking amazon to do it.

03:11:18

Am i looking to that this one was supposed to be super good. And i have so many options for increased storage capacity that i'm known, where even near halfway meeting my storage. Going to a reddit post asking the question of the best server to use. It's literally every single answer is just use forge, so it's like if whatever third party option, we use.

03:11:50

It's going to be one with. I bet as about a small community as molten hosting appears to have because forge appears, to have really cornered the market on this.

03:12:12

And the problem with that storage has a finite amount of space. Oh, this guy with three up votes. I run mine and google cloud using their free tier compute engine.

03:12:33

Works great for my group of six, interesting.

03:12:45

Oh, fuck me, forged and added a latent, a test latency.

03:12:57

And the ability to update a region. Oh, i just found someone suggesting bolten hosting and one of the fucking staff members from molten is like in the in the response going, hey man, i appreciate the feedback one small and then like he just starts doing customer service in the reddit comment about how they're not good, i guess.

03:13:25

So, let's see if he's still active. Maybe i can message him for you. He has not posted in a year. Wow. Okay? That's, that's fun. So we're going to be leaving. Molten holsting.

03:13:48

Probably a good idea at this junction and i'm on the map but i can't select anything.

03:13:59

Okay, here's here's a more recent post. Are you familiar with oracle? No. Are we talking is disco oracle. Uh i just uh, it's a oh it's just a another right of post i found. Um, Here, the stock operating result here.

03:14:30

Candle babe. It'll be like uh, three tier Oracle cloud. Yeah.

03:14:52

But then the next few results are all use molten quality was less than expected turn off. Pay period. Thank you, do not renew.

03:16:02

Yeah, so none of these people are having any issues with molt. Apparently that's just

03:16:23

Anyway, can i interact yet?

03:16:34

What is this post? Guy who says the contract for molten is 170 a month and someone responds with that's no it's less than five dollars a month. And then the guy responds apparently, there are different hosting sites named molten. Yes.

03:17:00

Or are we using the wrong molten hosting? It's crazy. Um so the one i'm using is the vlogs a month that gives 20 gigabytes

03:17:33

But the big thing here is it looks like some of these people were able to select which us server. They got the pick. The only one that was available in Oregon.

03:18:01

I don't know, forge's ability to check and update regions. Might be nice.

03:18:38

Take a look at that later.

03:18:44

Because it seems to me like,

03:18:55

Like it's not that it's consistently. And a seven thousand, dennis and whatever it takes for it, to hit time to kill. Like it's having moments where it's perfectly fucking fine. And then someone trips over the goddamn cable. Again, i know which makes me think it's was something in the game causing it.

03:19:22

Oh no. This junction. It is absolutely not the game. It's definitely, but i think to be moving just fine. Now, i give it half a second. Nope. There it goes. Yep. So, something about the movement.

03:19:45

I don't think that's necessarily true because like, it has moments where, like the movements just fine, it's animating the movement of our tokens and like, 120 frames per second. That's where all the band was going like. It's, it's definitely not that.

03:20:09

This is not a client-side problem. This is a server processing problem and given the fact that we're getting 502s and 504s, it tells me that somewhere in the handshake connection, it is just fuck dying and dropping.

03:20:29

I i would take your, your host out back and shoot them and fucking face. Um,

03:20:40

There is absolutely no excuse for why? It's, it's just dropping. You're not like are you bandwidth cat?

03:20:55

What do you mean? So, for the stuff that you have, i imagine not, but to ask you aren't limited by like how much outgoing data your server is actually allowed to pump out at speed, right? You're not limited to a connection of five. Okay, a lot. As far as i'm aware, i don't recall reading, anything like that anywhere.

03:21:25

I don't know. Whatever.

03:21:34

I'm soaring back out snow.

03:21:43

Let's check the beginners, guidepost thing. Maybe i read something wrong.

03:21:51

Okay. Oh, this helps me out immensely. Now that i'm actually reading the FAQ. So, you host this in lot, US was to correct. Okay. So i given that it is an AWS region which suggests this is a WA2 server.

03:22:16

There's got to be something in the background.

03:23:11

Running. No.

03:24:05

Everything seems to be moving again. No temporarily, if laggy.

03:24:27

Yeah, i gotta say i i'm wondering if it's probably was the intention of the the ap but grace it is completely lost in this maze of walls and and everything. Understandable also isn't help that we don't have that feature on where you can see where you have been. I got fog of war type stuff, so yeah.

03:24:55

Yeah, normally i'd be okay with turning that on but no one was making a map of the ton of the maze.

03:25:04

Honey, i just like to go through the maze at this current junction. That is totally fair, like Game is being very fucking mean, it really is.

03:25:25

But it looks like everyone is sort of in here.

03:25:33

I'm going to do this.

03:25:40

I think we've just been blindly following. No way, who has been basically just kind of interesting getting stuff in following trials.

03:25:53

Are you gonna do the thing?

03:26:04

Exceed the thing. So you are in a new section, which is called the hall of unbreakable screens. More screens fill this chamber, but they are made of metal and depicted rising dragons and base relief devouring hidden.

03:26:24

Devouring? What song hidden prey. Let's get over. Okay.

03:26:43

The balloons are quite done with the morgues. Thank you.

03:27:06

15.

03:27:11

There come. All right. Ken folks, move. I didn't move. Oh, looks like kind of yeah.

03:27:50

It's gonna move the mpc down over here. Boy. There's my favorite. So Ford great columns carved with depictions of dragons. Overlook a group. Poor give its hang from an iron next twist, stone spiral stairs that climbs to the ceiling.

03:28:33

And two tian men are. Nope. One young man and woman who appear petrified are inside the gibbits.

03:28:51

Main petrified or doing means stoned. I know, like they're scared to death. Oh, that's a wonderful.

03:29:04

I am the men tries to reach through his give it please. We were just walking through the woods.

03:29:16

Uh, i somehow do not believe you considering we are in the middle of the forest of spirits. Now, you don't understand. We were we were hunting can use, spiders came and they dropped this down here for those things to play with.

03:29:44

Uh, can i make a save to disbeliev? Illusion.

03:29:52

Yes, suppose such a, i disbelieve the walls, the floor, the ceiling, the tile kind of like uh, but don't, you don't think he's lying. This is my tattoo rude more tattoo of illusion detecting thing. This gets me killed. This is definitely not lying. This man is desperately hungry. He has been sliced and shredded by the more claws.

03:30:21

They've probably airlines them a lot. Like they both look like they've been put through the ringer of torture. Okay, believing them this thing gonna walk or something drinking joke. Sure will ask for 18 seconds to look at the cages just to make sure that like there's nothing weird. Yeah, i'm not getting 18 seconds, unless you stop.

03:30:44

Now from smashing a lock. Okay. Yeah, i give them my tanger drinking jug and some rations so they can eat and drink something. They are locked with average lux, uh so yes, no way knocks one off.

03:31:07

Um, well do i see? Are they enchanted somehow maybe like? Nope, there's no magic except what you and your friends have brought here and the ultravating. You know, divine magic, that invades? The entire pergoda that you have to stop looking at very quickly or go permanently blind.

03:31:36

All right but god has been enchanted by she's zero. I am. Okay. Oh, god damn it. They weren't joking. This pagoda was made by shizuru.

03:31:55

To be fair to show crow. Nice remaining shadow clone is very much of the same opinion. I'm just like, what are you doing? That's very stupid. What are you doing first? She abandons my country to the whims of a tyrant. And then she tries to blind me. Not the biggest fan.

03:32:16

I think you tried to blind you more importantly.

03:32:27

Come on up. Open out i am junzo. This is wood. Setsig please. Do you have any water? Yeah. Food have my tanger. Oh, way out and some rations. The way we came should be free of any dangers.

03:32:58

Uh, and shoko will look to coya for the water and food part. Can you guys hear? Do you think these two kids should be eating at? All right. Now, they haven't eaten anything like some water and some bread in their stomachs will do them. Good because nothing greasy. Hello.

03:33:28

All right, shoko will produce some rations and his water skin?

03:33:38

They fall on them hungerly.

03:33:44

How about now? Yes, hi. Hello drinking jug and some rations. I was waiting for the tender drinking joke. Oh god. No, i'm sorry. No one heard you eagerly fail upon your rations and drinking junk. Yeah, soco was looking at ochi just like heartlessly looking away from these two prisoners.

03:34:12

Like, wow, really came out. I was like, all right, i give him my tango drinking, joke, get some rashes. And i thought everyone was just fucking ignoring me. No, no, never. Oh. So do you think we could give him anything? And i'm like i already gave him. Shit, you were muted.

03:34:36

We did not hear you. I'm so sorry. Okay, i give them some rations. I was like, fuck me then and of course now the server seems to be more working. Perfectly fine. Oh my god of course. Okay. Anyways, sorry that was it's funny after the fact but i was like what the fuck guys?

03:34:59

Yeah, no, i'm sorry.

03:35:09

All right. Now we actually ignore Ochie for the rest of the game and make him think as Mike doesn't work. Exactly. Is this gonna go into that list of things like, oh, let's make noise think she's hallucinating a fucking rabbit. From whatever the fuck, you only, when we get to minkai will we'll find someone to to look at your head for, you know what?

03:35:39

What?

03:35:43

These two, just look so confused and a little concern.

03:35:52

Like so, what's your story alone is just like

03:35:59

You were hunting in the forest of spirits. Do i do? I get that right on the borders, not deep within.

03:36:14

Then you probably should have been safe. Yeah.

03:36:22

What have they been doing to you? Exactly. The the one who is this, who is a spider, but also a man gave us to these things to play with.

03:36:43

They called him akinosa, they would

03:36:59

Showcas brow. Frozen a second. Would you say you two were from what do you do for a living weird henners?

03:37:14

Another pelts from deer to make into into shoe leather that we send to mankai.

03:37:30

We were told that the only people patrolling the borders of the forests were the regent samurai. I can't believe i'm about to say this because wrong with you. What do you mean? What's wrong with me? We have people that have been left half dead and about to starve. Seriously we've been this tower has been tried to kill us for two floors.

03:38:02

I'm still not entire convinced. Can't blatant with it though. Friend. If they wanted to stop us in the back and chose to do it through two peasants, might i add that is a terrible idea. She adds to the ceiling. They wouldn't get the very far, you know, we, we do not want to fight you.

03:38:27

We simply want to go home. Shoko size and his shoulders. Relax. All i believe six of them right now and says wait here we'll come. Pick you back up on the way down. Oh yeah. Can you look them over for injuries? We can build this by looking at them that they're malnourished but i will tend to them.

03:39:03

There's no token action hun. My automation was still not entirely convinced that these two aren't just going to transform into like only the moment. We turn our backs to them. Uh clear patches them up quite well and feeds them, some sort of like boosting tonic apparently that she just in her bag like.

03:39:37

All right, brush it off reps and dirt on it.

03:39:47

No, she's very gentle with them gets in the drink some water.

03:39:54

That's them up to the side and casts a sanctuary spell on each of them.

03:40:04

Oh wait. I just realized if they were disguised in anyway. No, i would know. Wouldn't she business frozen shadow?

03:40:14

Might be part of the reason that kind of snap them.

03:40:22

Immediately looks like that entire exchange was incredibly gross, which is not not very happy with it.

03:40:36

Uh, thanks for the last round per level.

03:40:52

We give the lead to seal the faith.

03:41:02

Are we sure? We just want to leave them.

03:41:12

Well, it's all like we could take them with us. We could send them out into the forest, but i'm not sure out into the forest is fine. You may remember that we do have some people that are capping on, right on the edge. You guys just just wait here.

03:41:32

Okay. Youtube come with me, aquía, kind of grabs the both of them by the shoulder and that's what starlight.

03:41:55

What was that? What did she just do the boom. It doesn't have button setup.

03:42:08

We think, boom. She takes her and them just downstairs. Locks them to the front door. Now, walk straight to that forest line. Maybe make it quick. I'll watch you go.

03:42:33

Okay, watches them get cut down by lords. That would be awful if you run into an angry album lady, ignore her family for best two, walks back to the center of the room.

03:42:57

Coyote, teleports to the top floor solo is the boss. It says, let's go. I i couldn't believe i landed in the wrong spud. I could believe that that happened well done, i'm coming, you can appear her. Shout down the hall. I am never going to get used to that woman.

03:43:22

She literally landed like right here. I'm sorry to follow the blood. It's one. One square shy of making it she needs a line of sight for that for not for dimension door. Do you now punches a hole on the ground? Soca is going to turn to the party and say, wait a minute has teleport by the way.

03:43:54

So she's good terrifying and ask. So am i the only one that remembers when we first met Kim adotsu? What happened? How that went down? What do you mean then? We talked. Nope, not even you can enjoy that conversation.

03:44:25

Shit when we, when me and ochi went up to her because she thought we thought she was just oh, i forget what it was. The guild master of the rim runners was it? Well, that was their disguise. And then there was an owning in our face and both of us nearly died.

03:44:43

And there's like, again.

03:44:55

But i wasn't there for that. Maybe, if i have been,

03:45:07

Oh, that actually cleared up quite quickly that time. What the hell?

03:45:15

And her correctly. Know it was there for that. She was just outside and didn't and i would say what was going on through that and was pretty aware quite quickly as to who who is a board was it wasn't actually in the room with you and couldn't tell you or do anything to help you or save you.

03:45:43

He doesn't think about that, i swear.

03:45:52

So i can make it daytime again. Since there are windows on this floor. Oh, this floor. Yeah. Yeah. This this watching. It fucked. This floor appears to be covered in spikes as you come up the stairs.

03:46:14

This, this floor can get right fucked.

03:46:23

Like it means anything to you.

03:46:35

And not entirely. Sure. I know what?

03:46:44

So, for basic game room purposes, the entire floor is considered cow drops.

03:46:57

Oh lovely. Well, everything that is stone. I should say i was about to say so the outside of the room. That was good. No. The outskirts of the room. Does not look like it has been transfigured. And this does look like the wood has been transfigured because it goes straight from being stoned to wood.

03:47:23

Hmm, and what it is pillars or something? These yes, they are pillars. Okay, let me describe the room.

03:47:37

Hundreds of stone needles and spikes jug from the floor of this. Large open chamber. A row of iron grills in the floor. Runs around the providing videos into the level below. Thick web sweep upward from the dragged floor towards the roof, some 60 feet above ending in a dark and shadowy funnel.

03:47:55

That's slopes upward into the farther reach of the soda on each wall around windows surrounded by iron barbs looks out over the gardens surrounding the

03:48:10

I see.

03:48:24

Noise sheets both of her. Because all right, you are cutting out there for me. Sans. Could you repeat that description? I certainly can.

03:48:44

Hundreds of stone needles and spikes jump from the floor of this. Large open chamber. A row of iron grills in the floor. Runs around the perimeter writing below. Click web sweep upward from the jagged floor towards the roof, some 60 feet above, and ending in a dark and shadowy funnel that slopes upwards into the farthest reaches goda.

03:49:08

On each wall around. Windows surrounded by iron looks out over the gardens browning the tower.

03:49:19

So this looks like the top floor then. No, not even remotely.

03:49:31

So these are these are just pillars, right? Sorry? I'm trying to yeah, they are pillars. They are the same four dragon pillars. You have seen on the previous two floor, they seem to rise up through the entirety. They continue all the way up to the roof and then beyond beyond that do that.

03:49:50

Now, they are the four support pillars of the pug. Pagoda. They are also claimable that is that is the next question. Thank you friend. Uh, because yeah. Oh, she's like, oh, it's not like you pair of attention. Like what are you talking about and then proceeds to do exactly the thing that he's talking about.

03:50:13

Um, because yeah, what you're gonna do? Stop me. Who are you, please?

03:50:27

Don't give a fuck remember, no way. This is a sneaking mission.

03:50:36

You've probably drum so loud that my heart thought it was leaving my chest.

03:50:50

And then you basically see her like half run of of this fucking thing. Oh, mind your feet.

03:51:03

What's going on up there? They have koya and i may go whoever made it up with their dip, does it look like if we progress slowly, we could walk without hurting ourselves and that would be under the rules of kaltrops, which i did not have open each time. A creature moves into an area covered by kaltrops or spending around fighting while standing a certain area, runs the risk.

03:51:42

Stepping on make an attacker over the countdrive space that components plus zero against creature attack. The creature armor and the electric bonuses do talent. The creature is wearing shoes or other footwear AC bonus. If the attack succeeds, the creek heel drop deals. One point of damage and reduced by half because of its wounded foot anything, you're moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of cow.

03:52:08

Trousers with no trouble.

03:52:14

So you're just gonna jump to the very lessons while i'm reading the paragraphs. Everyone, they're still plenty of stuff in there to just skipping over.

03:52:28

Yes, there's a hill. Check to remove the, uh, speed penalty or one point of magical.

03:52:42

This they make an attack role with a plus zero a bacon. It's basically your decks n plus.

03:52:57

Uh, you still get all your dodge bonuses and stuff you remove shield, armor and deflection.

03:53:10

He jumps over that.

03:53:21

Oh, you go over there.

03:53:34

So one person's going up a pillar. Oh she's gone off to the side. Uh greason would have jumped but suddenly a mako's in front of them so he can't come through. Yeah.

03:53:52

Welcome. You can jump through them though. Don't think it's about it for them, we all know you could just jump over. It's true also.

03:54:10

Stroko will double move at half speed to get over here.

03:54:22

Decent decent. Jumps to the corner. Suspended key point to do it.

03:54:43

So i see a lot of movement, but do we have a plan than anyone thinks stairs? Is that a mako asking that? Yeah, not not from here. I don't see a way out of this room. That is why i'm trying to get elevation love. Oh, you can go ahead and increase your elevation by another two feet.

03:55:09

If you'd like cabbie, uh, i'd like to increase it by it, by by as many as you let me which is a very different statement. By 10 is where we're gonna start. Struggle will get the web start getting thicker. The farther. You go up. Oh, that's interesting. Hmm, i hate it.

03:55:30

I hate it up here.

03:55:34

What do i see when? I look down a great. You see the labyrinth from below?

03:55:42

Oh, i could see the floor below from here.

03:55:51

That's probably bad, isn't it? That means they were watching us. Where do i get the distinct impression? But i'm not gonna love this.

03:56:08

Boom, you can probably make this save, but if you go up another 10 feet, i need you to make a reflect and maybe say this one's exist. It's fine. It's true. It's true.

03:56:25

Come on, noah you could do it. You're like, uh, you're like a thing that eats spiders. I don't know what that would be. I don't know what is, yo.

03:56:39

Go. I hate that. Uh, that's not all that's up there. Yo we have lost sight of no way. Yes, you have because no a is now in the fun. In, in the foot, in the fall, cut off funnel. Uh, by the way, um, the magnus is not just you, i having, uh, i'm hearing him cut out a bunch, too.

03:57:13

It seems quite likely that i am having internet.

03:57:20

Okay, let me see if i can just move these up now and put them here instead of there.

03:57:38

I think she's rural will be fine if we just burn the entire fucking pagodadam.

03:57:47

Genuine conversation always just having with her imaginary rabbit. I think that's a thing. She's a forgiving god-ass, right? Wait no, no, i remembering that story. You told me about the fact that by the entire reasons, but he always survived is because she couldn't let go and also is like hello retributive.

03:58:10

So maybe not actually. Hmm, awful, good simmer. I got us, local.

03:58:22

As incidentally also. Why? Okay, it's not working. What if i place them like this? Okay, we'll do it this way can to do. There are eight of them.

03:58:44

Oh. Oh gee. Does it look like we could open that window maybe climb up outside or something? That's what i was looking for. If there was an exterior lady to go up but i don't see anything. The windows are open.

03:59:07

Are you looking outside? I'm looking outside. I'm standing right in front of the window. I'm not like sticking my head out and like, bleeding out, but i'm standing in front of this window. Oh, if you don't actually stick anything out, you can't look up. We can't look up now without sticking.

03:59:28

Something outside the window. No. Oh yeah. No, i was just looking left and right. As i go past these windows, as i did like a half laps, even if there was something outside. Anyways, we haven't heard anything from no way. Oh, i'm sure you're hearing a bunch of things from, no way.

03:59:46

I'm finally caught up. All right. So, very important. I can't roll all of these at once or you can guess again, i can come toggle combat state. Yes, maybe yeah. Yeah, there we go. There we go.

04:00:20

You're, you're not sure how many of you understand how we're talking again, because that is a

04:00:31

Vicious amount of swearing. Okay, i'm languages. Nope.

04:00:46

Around every pick it up.

04:00:53

This waiting on, you know it. I don't want to. And interested.

04:01:17

I'm just gonna say they each have for and call it good. Uh, all of the arena also have mirror images going.

04:01:32

Burn it plastic is so you're aware. You are aware. In fact, wherever this okay, i was not expecting floor. Three of the pagoda to be the one where they just completely unload on us.

04:01:53

This is gonna suck. I you killed one of their queens. Yeah, they got a little mad at me, and now i feel like i'm about to get my karmic response, and i'm thought about that right now. It's okay, we will get through this and then everyone else can join an initiative as well.

04:02:23

Hey, you're invisible right now, right? Absolutely not.

04:02:32

A boom and puts itself into a spin as it descends from the web counts as a chart, okay? So this apprenia lose itself from its webbing spiraling through the air at you. As web unfoils in every direction. Us two more charging. Well spinning. Uh, 21 to hit. Uh yeah, the plot flooded or three points of damage.

04:03:07

These ones do not have sneak attack. There's a button mold in the sentence. Uh, but they do have points in. Yep. Which is button is broken. So it's a DC. 14 does this knock? Oh yeah. Oh um, okay, so duration is six rounds. You only need to make the save once but you jesus lose three strengths.

04:03:42

Three strength them. You got it, fun.

04:03:49

Boom. Boom.

04:04:00

Perfect.

04:04:04

This is running a drops from the ceiling 30 feet, using angry falling leaves. It's web then arrests its fall and it makes a touch attack against ochi

04:04:29

Uh, this is gonna be so annoying without the combat head.

04:04:37

Things mailing. It's fairly.

04:04:56

Oh, you did hit me now that i think about it, i should probably make a climb check to see if i fall their points and that's actually a 14 to hit your flat footage. Such a cog, um, strong, maybe

04:05:14

Pull. That footage is 18 about.

04:05:26

That would attached. So basically just deflection bonuses.

04:05:34

Like, i couldn't tell you. Let me, okay, so no, dodge bonuses.

04:05:48

Why is your gingasa of the fortunate soldier giving to your touching?

04:05:59

It's a deflection bonus plus one. Oh, sweet, right? That's the headpiece. Okay. So, minus 97, so minus 12.

04:06:25

So yes, this is a hit angry falling leaves his attack. Requires me really touch attack and deal points of damage to the target and the Renee takes 160 successful.

04:06:42

Oh, gee. You take eight points of damage as this arena. Web dancer comes flying down and does half the amount of damage. He did you to self.

04:07:06

Give it your skater. Skitter skater, skater skater.

04:07:16

For anyone directly blow her, no one is.

04:07:26

Yeah, they're scary all over their webs, the super blinking. And you are already poisoned, so,

04:07:47

Then i just a plus two, tier or minus 2 to your saves. All right. Yeah. It's uh, it's basically DC goes up by two and yeah, the duration goes up there Afghan or something. No.

04:08:07

That's terrible.

04:08:15

I did forget that i still have one but at this junction, this is funnier. So, and it's two.

04:08:26

This drops out of the webs above you or as a big spider, i'm cham cham. I don't really said you call had a fight. Now, this is um, i think it's 17 misses your flat footed. Oh yes, it does actually

04:08:54

Other giant spider. Drops down to 25 lights of the floor. Folks down to 30.

04:09:15

There was one in the web directly above you shoko. I'm so sorry.

04:09:25

It just sees a shadow around him getting bigger. It kind of real.

04:09:41

Why won't you let me adjust the 25 come on. It does not complied with a floor now. There we go. So he's actually above you, that's super charging. This is your touch. I see, luckily the spiders are not as scary as the runny.

04:10:10

Ah good. A grayson

04:10:23

To the spiders. Have to make a check against the, the couch drops. Nope, he's still not touching the cal drops.

04:10:34

If there goes all my aoe, my only iowie option requires them to be touching the ground selling 630. Please actually doesn't. Actually doesn't say that it's just a 15 foot cone even though it says, you're striking the ground. I do not think at 15 hits though. Touch. AC grayson, i'm not going to touch AC.

04:11:01

I should say, no, because i looked it up and hit his monk wisdom. Ac bonus applies. Even against flat-footed and touch attacks. Yes, monkey is awesome. In that way. It's functionally wrong.

04:11:18

Intuition is impeccable. No way. You got to act in this round. I don't want to act uh so i don't need to make a thing. It wasn't. But uh, yeah no no no, no, no, not doing it, not we're not playing that game.

04:11:41

Like acrobatics, the the fuck down. That thing. I did not expect you guys to go up solo into the webs above. Yeah, but i'm an idiot. Okay, well that's what the rogue does. They scout. It's true. Why it slide the it's why they're at the party corpse a little louder as no way.

04:12:08

Basically like a zip lines back down that thing with this rather like nasty looking gouge in her neck. Just like, oh, it's not my words. So it's trained. Mom's words, it's accurate. Also, this is why you and now, if lose the cleric or the the wizard, or something like, that's, that's very bad.

04:12:34

If you lose the thief, you get a new space. That's how that looks.

04:12:40

But yeah, that will have taken like all of every minute to basically just drop. And isn't it? I don't like that.

04:12:52

Uh, does that draw the sword?

04:12:59

Spiders fucking awful and they really are. Why sugar? Oh, fuck there. Okay. The ninja i go on your guyses combat states as well. Oh, i just realized that first spiders bite is within five of my flat footage. So, one clone goes poof.

04:13:29

Yeah, no, it's close when it that makes the second spiders. Also, within five of your flat footed. Oh, no. Because it's a 13. My flight footage is 20.

04:13:44

Sorry, not your flat footed. Touch. That was the marks and the iranias.

04:13:54

Who am i missing? Koya, let me go.

04:14:05

Oh, we're all rolling initiative now. Uh, we're almost through the surprise around.

04:14:16

All right, well tell everyone. Getter scooter.

04:14:26

I guess we're just rolling. Okay, any this one crawls down.

04:15:04

Drop you here.

04:15:21

Here, plus two or charging.

04:15:32

It's amigo because that makes a fortitude. Save not get poisoned. Onions spider.

04:15:53

Kidder scooter, scooter.

04:15:59

Moves down.

04:16:24

Boom, this one performs. The following leaves technique called angry falling leaves. Excuse me. I wish you didn't. No, excuse me. I am doing this one wrong. Uh, this one is performing the graceful sense. You cut out. Oh, excuse me, this one is performing the graceful descent of the flying blade.

04:16:54

That fills me with such joy. What are these? Are these like monster features or are they class features? They are ready there? Yeah, they are their tianzia ninja spider abilities from the book. Okay, this is this is the woosha part of the antique. Yes.

04:17:20

Ninja spiders things. I did, but that one needs to perform an acrobatics. Check against your cmd. What's the end day? I mean, it's still gotta try. I believe, you know, i i don't think a 15 gets it. That's actually failed. So this already a literally just flies past you and then back up into the web.

04:17:52

And her movement is treated as if she's sprung attack, okay. All with extras, let's bring it back with extras, but only for these things.

04:18:10

There's no one near this spider, so it's going to double move across the room on its floor.

04:18:25

Don't start now and you were doing so good.

04:18:31

Boom. Boom, and then this one does the same thing.

04:18:42

Uh, no. A, it does provoke from you. Just not amigo.

04:18:54

So this is rainier goes swinging, past you and both amigo as it goes Amanda. The real questionnaire is uh, that technically flanking. I imagine not i'm gonna go still hasn't gone yet. Yeah, that's what i thought. That's fine. Had she gone? I would totally let it be blinking. That is understandable.

04:19:15

Thank you for your mercy, but I, you are. You know, you're not, you're not getting, you're not getting stamped, you're getting punched. I've decided.

04:19:39

No shit. They're all supposed to have a higher ground. Okay, i mean that's fair. Boom, boom. So you just straight like clock this area and just like puts fist directly and path just like and then she's still like completes her swing back up but she does not stick the lending and you see her just go tumbling into the funnel of web up on the ceiling.

04:20:11

Very young graceful.

04:20:16

I don't know why, but my brain just immediately translated that to be like, like i know, she's, i know you said very ungracefully but i but my i heard very ungrasenly. All right.

04:20:38

Grace. It would have stuck that landing. That's what i'm saying. Jason would have stuck that landing. Absolutely. Never. Have you seen into a graceful dwarf? And now i'm picturing grace of swinging through the webs like doing the with all the graceful lucia moves. That is she got a plus four from flanking and charging and she met good on you.

04:21:04

She's just that good. Oh i'm gonna be that guy. Oh she's flat footed. Is 18.

04:21:15

It is, you're right, it is okay. Three points of damage in a fortitude. Say please.

04:21:25

And please be that guy. This is supposed to be an awesome fight. You guys should take damage. I cry. Three points of damage in fortitude, three points and a quarter to save. We all expect OG to cry. So like, oh, she is just slowly, but surely becoming itchy, the killer?

04:21:45

Yeah. You you know how on wiki's they have like a quote from the character above their wiki page, i take a free action to cry, i had better be. Oh jeez. Also grayson, i know sometimes you have time constraints on saturdays. If it's getting too late for you, please let me know.

04:22:05

I didn't want this. I didn't want this game session to go buy without us getting anything done. Now i'm good today. The ceiling. I mean we got licked a bunch, you did, but this this was supposed to be much funner and i feel like we lost half a game to fucking technical difficulties and then we did.

04:22:30

That's good. Yeah we can do to that getter scooters. Getter save, buy me some life. Um it prevented you from taking strength damage. Yes, that's what i was looking for. Oh, okay. Uh, that would be a 22 against your flat footy, because you're still flat-footed there. So many spiders, but that's the last spider.

04:22:57

Uh so another save. If you please uh at a plus two. Right? No this is a different type of poison. Yes, it's not theory. Poison, you're good.

04:23:14

My natural enemy spiders and build. I mean i mean the bird killing tarantulas are a thing. It's true and 6:30.

04:23:36

I hate it. I keep going to their HUD to try and do stuff. No way. This is against you. This is against my flat footage, you were not fuck with it anymore. No. Oh my god. Cheesy. Then i assume that's what you want, correct? Um no excellent. She misses as she drops from the ceiling following you.

04:24:07

Oh, you're turn already bites at the OG and misses bringing us, then to koya's turn. Finally we get to do things, okay?

04:24:31

Clear steps in moving in half speed.

04:24:39

Can i go here?

04:24:49

Well, that's enough of that. I think and coyote points up.

04:25:00

It says god i'm gonna need your help on this one. Kinda. Yeah.

04:25:09

Let me go up here. Why do we do boop? She's targeting of no way right now. Sorry, ochi.

04:25:28

Looking at it. No, please

04:25:37

So do we think my 10 minute possible effect will expire sometime during this combat? And i will be paralyzed before. Spiders would be pretty terrible.

04:25:53

Oh,

04:25:57

Um you hear several sounds of horrified screaming and shrieking as still erraneate just outright die. Uh, another or another two are reduced to two hp and all the spider webs above you catch on fire.

04:26:22

You know, i know it doesn't and i don't think the northern star would ever like me that much, but i'm a real fan right now. Which she smiled at you. I'll fuck you were bidding casein.

04:26:45

Uh Chris is going to target the spider that's between him and Ochi.

04:26:59

Athemi.

04:27:05

Uh, so the first two arrows, drop the spider. Okay, and then follow-ups will go. Uh, i think against the one on the other side of emoji.

04:27:23

We wish that's

04:27:30

Uh, the arena. Yes. Um,

04:27:38

The crit does not confirm but your key arrow kills her. Your fourth arrow unfortunately. Misses and then he'll take a five foot step uh to be right next to OT so that they could be back to back. So there's no chance they'll get flanked.

04:28:04

A fair tactic and eventually my token will move up. There we go. So are they hanging from webs that? Exactly. Like, horizontally level with us? Yep. Well, some of them. The ones are 25. Feet are above you. The ones at 20 feet are next to you. Just not touching the ground.

04:28:27

Correct, uh, which will be changing in two rounds as the fire starts consuming their web.

04:28:45

Uh, giant spiders turn.

04:29:00

With spider, are you?

04:29:09

Oops, 25 feet, another spider drops from the ceiling.

04:29:20

And watches and ochi ochi you have. Well, that's fighters dead. So i'm gonna delete him and the gray thing is there. Oh no. Did i delete all of them? No, no. There's still lots of spiders over there. Spider there and 20 feet and then there's one spider above him at 25.

04:30:09

Oh my god. What is happening? Why are there so many of them now?

04:30:24

A renege evil, uh, very much so.

04:30:59

Which is going to. She's off. And boom that hits that hits and cuts her down. Then OG will. Didn't you say that the arena all had mirror image on shit they did? That's right. Both of those are hits though. So, uh, one is the arena absent image? This seems like a lot to keep track hits the reignier still alive.

04:31:44

It is a lot to keep track of i'm not gonna lie. The pagoda was something i had night.

04:31:54

I understand there are dungeons. That are worse though. Let's, uh, take the skull off of this one so that we don't forget that it is not dead. That is fair. I want my automations back.

04:32:10

Please just take it out one day.

04:32:21

It'll get, i mean, Jason was trying to get you. The stuffing flanked. This is a very ochy thing to do. Yeah, it really is. He's dummy from being funny and they're stepping to flinking listen. Oh, can i five foot stuff? There even is that difficult to rain cow drops don't count as difficult terrain.

04:32:50

It's just adjacent, it's difficult to rain. You step into the terrain and you're not perfectly moving and have feeds, so they would make an attack roll. And if they hit you, you then start moving and have speed. I just won't move. I'll stay where it was reconsider in combat.

04:33:12

There's no way to carefully move through cal traps. Gotcha. Boom. All right. Is that if you're turning them? Yes, i ended turn. Excellent already already. Oh, that's where all that damage went.

04:33:41

Okay.

04:33:55

This one swings down.

04:34:01

To bite at no way and misses Giant spiders on shoko. Yes, indeed. Computer scooter. Skitter. Oh,

04:34:22

They're smart enough to flank. Oh, they're smart enough to learn combat tactics. Yes, as they are trained beast.

04:34:35

Nothing i could do about that. That's just a, that is a hecken heckin damage, though. Hey and fortitude say please, what is their poison? Uh you're not affected by it which is a good thing. Because here's the airport.

04:35:04

She'll go. Yes, the arena ideal strength damage and their pet steel condomage.

04:35:13

Uh, it's not my fault. Oh, don't like it. Just oh, shoko will attempt to acrobatics his way out of this mess.

04:35:37

Yoko does not. Oh, so he moves anyways and takes two aops's. How that works, right? Yep. That's okay. That's okay. We gotta wait, we got it. We got two misses. Two wiffs. All right. Do i still move it half speed? Well, performing acrobatics. Yes. Yeah, even if it fails?

04:36:03

Yeah. Okay.

04:36:09

And once i'm away from them can you know? No no that's the expensive. How far you can go. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

04:36:23

How far away. Are you okay? Just close enough. Okay, everyone gets rondo.

04:36:39

It's cardiac arrest time. Yes, it is.

04:36:55

How nice that i played something with drums. Yes and how nice but koya is helping out by putting the blaze and blazing Rondo. Is everything's on fire. I hate it. Please stop clear logic. Do you know that this place was probably pretty fire retardant? It's the whole being constructed by its deity.

04:37:21

Yes, we agree on that. Zero did a pretty bad job of keeping it clean though. Boom. Giant spiders turn shizzar. Who's like look i i understand my own mess. Okay. I i don't need to clean up. It's pretty true.

04:37:50

Do do these things to hit? Uh, can i dodging up panache at that i suppose?

04:38:09

Boom. Boom. Remember to click your financial. Spend it. Okay, always remember to spend your features. I'm pretty sure you use the financial in the first floor. I don't think i did if you like i remembered you dodging financing something else all, i'll use it. I don't remember doing it but all i'll i'll i'll give as you've been a while.

04:38:47

And i have been keeping track of our performances. I just don't want to click it every round because like, look at how big this fucking text boxes. Nope, totally fair. Um, both are all of it to be secret and it doesn't present that I'll make of gonna separate here.

04:39:16

Concentration, she good.

04:39:34

Oh, that's unfortunate.

04:39:43

I thought i would have gotten a lot more. How did it still have an animation? Are very confused. The animation module is, it's the most stubborn i know.

04:40:06

Uh, oh, that's fine. That a runny dies, even if it saves.

04:40:18

So she'll go the spider that was like on your ass takes a a lightning bolt.

04:40:28

Which hap cooks it.

04:40:34

Here. Renee.

04:40:41

Boo. Boo tries to bite at Grayson. Is this wondering? I'm just wondering when RNA are going to start dropping out of the sky because the web's burned out. Boom. We haven't even finished round two. No way. So pop around because we didn't do it poison. Oh yeah.

04:41:16

It's okay. You've got you've got you've got rondo making your heart pump faster. That makes better, right? You're absolutely right. It is currently actually going to cause a heart attack. So, two points of string damage. Uh, so now we have a problem because that causes all sorts of stuff to happen because i'm approaching a medium load.

04:41:46

Yeah. Uh she is twitching a little bit awkwardly to, to this particular and it's like well.

04:42:02

Okay, then

04:42:08

Zip. No, we just pieces out. Well, there's a technically us and moldiness. Um, so i actually need to figure out how to do this. Because if this thing dies, from two of these attacks,

04:42:43

Uh, it might die from um, it dies from the first one because they have 37 hp, okay? So it's capitates that one turns around. Um, she has not been able to draw her other sword yet which means she has free hand, which means. Hey sure. Again, that's a thing.

04:43:07

Um, so this i don't know over here. Uh, do you want me to just reroll negative five or is it negative nine? Because is it in mellow? Uh it is in melee with omeco. Yes, cool. Uh, so yeah you would have to. Now, you can just apply and negative well, i guess you'd have to

04:43:45

So those are all have your two. I've been fighting stats and stuff and yeah, the two weapon fighting actually still applies. So oh wait. Oh yeah, actually, it would still apply because i just haven't done my other attack yet so actually. Yeah, i can. I can literally just roll a full attack with my shirt and that's, that's fine.

04:44:03

Yeah, and then we've really good because you only got the one

04:44:10

Well, i mean, i have my second attack and a haystaction so Well, add the minus 4.

04:44:25

It gets both of those one of them botches, but

04:44:42

And hit. Like to think that last hurricane just like tries to get thrown, and then she's like, oh, oh, my hands aren't working. Perfect. I'm, i'm used to having a bit more throwing strength than this. I can't tell my wrist anymore.

04:45:06

Giant spider. Giant spider.

04:45:19

Makes a bite bite bite.

04:45:24

No no. She's fine, still no one will ask every successfully poisoned the new empress of Tianvia,

04:45:36

Um been out on a drinking night with me up, she learned that the feet of grayson. You know what? I take that statement, back, you're right. Nor will the Renee manage to tumble pastor either.

04:45:57

No, no. You stay there and bleed. Uh, this one those fall because the webbing it was in just burns away.

04:46:12

A 60 foot drop from the funnel. Uh these spike floors, do an extra point of damage per 10 feet from which you fall. That's rude. She only has two hp. So, she hits the ground and is impaled.

04:46:35

They just see an arena fall from the ceiling and die much as was previously requested. Now, they're regretting transmuting it to this instead of a nice soft cushion.

04:46:50

I'm totally happy with this. This is great amazing, 10 out of 10.

04:47:03

Theaters up the wall.

04:47:17

Misses the grayson. Popular around there. So many. Bites at Ochi mrs.

04:47:34

Koya.

04:47:46

Uh no way you're still in the same spot. Ah, there you are. If i'm doing just peaches somehow, i don't believe you. But luckily, since we first encountered,

04:48:05

The frozen shadows and i almost died. I have always kept.

04:48:17

That seems inordinately powerful for magic.

04:48:24

Actually any sort of them and succeed like cancer level check. Right? So again, dc 13, 15 currently. 15. Currently spells caster level. She obliterates the poison in your system.

04:48:49

Exactly. Does it do no additional effects from the poison and any temporary effects are ended. But the spell does not reverse instantaneous effects which is hitpoint damage. Temporarability damage or affects the duck away, okay? Yeah, you got rid of the poison but uh yeah now so it's not that not the damage it's caused.

04:49:04

That's correct. Yeah, hello i am back. I did know. I dropped dead of con damage. She did not, she was suffering from strength damage. That's right damage. I'm so sorry. Uh oh gee you are just out of range. Uh but also you don't have uh show because damn near back up to full.

04:49:36

Yeah, these RNA targeted. Totally the wrong. People shogo would be very scared of them. You missed the RNAF falling out of the burning webs and getting impaled on the ground. That's true. Yes. Uh, okay. That was her. She fell from the ceiling, Grayson

04:49:56

It's gonna go for the spider right next to them.

04:50:06

Boom. This is a hit.

04:50:14

Two arrows. Equals zed spider. All right, then follow up will go against this one. That's a little bit further away.

04:50:28

Two arrows is dead spider. You'll have final arrow. Uh, we'll use it on the erinand next. To, oh, g. She is also dead for, she had already taken damage.

04:50:49

Where he is?

04:50:54

Oh, g. This round on dwarven tower defense.

04:51:03

I fucking love Grayson. I can go there.

04:51:11

Are you going to move it? Have speed. Sure then. Yes. And actually, i will go a little bit further. Okay. So we are also tumbling or we provoking. So you were moving at quarter speed. I think that should still be fine. Is that even a thing? Yes. Yeah, i think so that would give you 20ish, yeah, 20.

04:51:47

You're you're good. Exactly. There.

04:51:56

The answer is probably no, the answer is very much. Yes. Oh, hell yeah. They have a CMD of 19 OG casts spider delete. There's actually a Harry Potter spell for that. Like, actually, there's a specifically one for go away. Spider. Uh, well the question is do you want to hit the spider or the irony?

04:52:27

Oh, i'll hit the spider.

04:52:40

Yeah, i'll put him only halfway over.

04:52:47

Yeah, irania xume specifically. Fucks buyers. The spell and actually pretty great. Yeah, there's a whole thing where that spell was created only for the movies because they wanted Harry to have a blasting spell to use that move. I find it.

04:53:12

Really. Apparently i have the arena targeted but yeah, he did. That's fine. I put the damage on the other one. Thank you. Oh, i believe that will be it for you. Uh, yeah.

04:53:32

Diane spider getters along the wall. What is their client speed? Actually, it is 30. So he'll then go up five feet over another five to 30 so that he's right above ochi.

04:54:05

Ochi then spiders is stranded block you in. He misses it's creepy skittering though. Very go show me choco shoki.

04:54:29

Well, there's a spider next to me and i'm hasted. So i guess we get to show this what i recommend stabbing. Yeah, Renee deletus.

04:54:45

Uh, turn to show the spider. The shoco is not just a caster, is anyone actually think of showgo as a caster? No.

04:55:00

Ashoko she'll go in emoji's head cannon just like bangs his bongos and screeches a dead stuff and there's some reason so are you telling me is that he's just a fox that plays a drum and screeches. If you've never heard what a fox sounds like screaming. Yeah. Yeah, i could, i could believe that would wake the fucking dead.

04:55:24

Yes. Yes, it would. So do all those hit. They do all hit. The spider is the live unfortunate. It has five hp left.

04:55:40

Right hairy reposed a spider or does not have to be a humanoid, welcome to repairing repost anything, thank you, it's here, most anything i use things instruments from local music shops across

04:55:57

Anything else for you? No baba. Baba baba. Boom. They're not in the planking position because one is above you.

04:56:19

Um, a co

04:56:27

If anybody seen those videos before, the like fox yelp? Yeah. Um wow. She misses with both of those.

04:56:48

It's arena gives up on trying to hit greyson and she has had zero. Best has no more success. So, attacking ochi nohe, uh, so i can't fly foot but i can move Very carefully around those like, okay. Don't worry about it, just for my knowledge. I and these things see me.

04:57:20

They cannot it was in fact a no and a mako provides blinking as she just one with 10. No sui, indeed.

04:57:33

So, uh, let's just add four to this.

04:57:43

But yeah, where did i just apply that damage to

04:57:54

It did not kilogram.

04:58:01

No, it's not sequoia.

04:58:06

Okay, doesn't look like it went anywhere. I must not have had any token selection. Was it to me?

04:58:16

Did you take 28 points of damage? Think i took 28 points damage.

04:58:25

Deserve that. I know you've taken this like seven. That's so so far. They haven't rolled very high damage but they visit you.

04:58:40

So let's put you back to your 82 and then minus 7 to 75. Yes, it was definitely for you. I see this now, okay, next, uh, yes, uh don't, don't worry about it. I've got it and manages to, like ripped under one in this thing. Jesus was a lot of damage.

04:59:05

It has nine hp left. I couldn't bleed out like the other thing can because yeah that's that's mature. Oh shit. He did. Do that. Did you? Uh, there are armor. Thickened and bleed.

04:59:29

Giant spider. It's his turn it bleeds and is second it has no idea. What did that choice?

04:59:41

Missing terribly.

04:59:46

We will lose more more. No more of the clutch today.

05:08:03

Um adventurers, speak to akinosa.

05:08:14

Oh no. Who is now death for the next six seconds. In my opinion, doesn't hear most of that. It was just like,

05:08:34

Oh, she says a prayer over the spiders. Do we hear what direction the voice is coming from?

05:08:45

And how are we going to get up? Well, i mean, the webs are all gone and the pillars. Look real easy to climb.

05:08:57

Chuckle looks at his nude alarms. Speaking of i mean that's solely fair. Somebody is poison and needs to not be poisoned. That's also true. I have. Okay. For me though. Yeah, me too. Sugar will navigate his way off of the couch drops, though. Who's still poisoned? That's damage. Makeup.

05:09:23

Oops, she does have two neutralized poisons prepared. So she uses one on. Well, actually, let's check omega safe for the round. You you can, but no is just going to like an invisible hand is going to grab a hold of a wrist. And is she wearing that thing that?

05:10:01

No, i gave her. Yes, because one of those pills is going to rip itself off and just shove it directly in our mouth, pay attention, which is the light poison. So, you're fine.

05:10:19

Also, the chances of her failing that DC 15 are quite low.

05:10:27

Yes, but i don't know that. That's true quiz. Like why is this space so occupied? Oh yeah. Because it's occupied because you invisibly rip something off of up because wrists and jump to the door mouth. She looks briefly briefly she looks startled. Before she swallows it. Uh,

05:11:01

No. Do you need assistance coming into my domain? I can have webs and downs.

05:11:35

No. Yeah, i definitely wanted to finish the but i think this is a good place. So. Oh actually, can i do one thing before we end? I didn't actually do a skill. Check to identify, what the spiders were like art? Is there anything special about them? No, they were just yeah.

05:11:52

They they are called blue sapphire, spiders. They are native to tian and they are basically like the avistan hunting spiders. Only blue and it was very difficult to find artwork that worked for them. It is next week. I actually stole our work from Pathfinder toy.
