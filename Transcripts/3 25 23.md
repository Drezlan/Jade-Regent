00:03

I keep forgetting. There's no, i like i like the symbol for the past about it facebook. It's just like a, a little gremlin hiding in the bush is going.

00:22

All right, so oh no, way you're up there. Uh, you can ignore the webs now on level 30 and 40 as you go up. Yeah, you guys are taking the ropes and you just see now, i like scrambling up the thing and then at some point stops waves are hand like And then she keeps going.

00:51

I'm gonna wait eventually rounds off around. I would imagine like here, pop up.

01:02

That will be close enough. If you please.

01:11

Now, i can reveal this.

01:17

Thanks, i hit it.

01:22

No. Should we all make? Climb checks. No, not if you're using the ropes. Okay, i could have no way making climax, but i'm gonna ask is the bc seed, climb this thing higher than 24. Uh, not the dragon pillars, no the walls. Yes. Thinking um how do we go about changing the elevation of our characters?

01:51

Uh, so if you pop open the toe connection head around your token, be worth his 20 right there. You know, you can just increase that either in 10 foot increments as you go up, if you want to see the other floors or just change it to 50.

02:13

I will climb a pillar.

02:26

Yeah, i'm not i'm not seeing it. Like, i'm i'm i'm clicking on my token. Sorry. Don't left. Click, you know uh you get the little thing with your your drop box. You just went somewhere. Oh, okay. Now it's okay. Now, it's loading. That's a lot of oh that's a that's a messy messy floor.

02:54

Then we go to 40. I'm going 50. And okay.

03:12

Just put me over on solid ground.

03:19

A 30 gets me. 10 feet up, right? I can go the 10 feet and look as i go. Yeah. And what's your bonus like 20 15? Oh, so if you just take 10, who is that? Hidden behind this. Great, big decal. You have here. Uh, oh. Oh. I feel like i can see a very disturbing part of his, his picture here.

03:54

I dislike being here.

04:06

Why are you not show?

04:12

Reminds me of the gift of that one girl with the pet spider. Uh, yes, he is munching them. But appears to be a much smaller spider, a munching on and oh, that's not good. That's, that's not as cute as well. What i was thinking.

04:39

I hate everything to do with this. You have come into my home, real murdered my family.

04:51

Why very quickly this circle my thingy has been persistent over 30 40 and 50 feet. I don't remember if it was there before, it was not supposed to be down that far. It was only supposed to be here to represent the pagoda. He has seated in upon a massive throne culture.

05:19

I should actually describe it this scene, one second.

05:26

I didn't mention of correct meds fat ass. Did they? And when i was,

05:45

Well, you're the best at saying, through disguises is this our Operates that we were told about. Does he look like a prisoner to you?

06:09

Boom, here we go. Which is more of a question. It's supposed to be the end than you still the thick webs converge around. The ceiling of the shattered chamber. Ancient skulls, grinned down from their last terrible, resting places. Gololo arms seem to reach out for sucker, the sagging remnants of the floor, hang over the rest of the web below and the great ornamental palan.

06:37

King stands on this dark. Ledge next to a huge wardrobe above another funnel web leads upward.

07:07

Was anyone gonna mention that we're here?

07:13

Oh, i think our host knows that all too. Well, why would i know that you were here to kill only?

07:31

Shoko looks slightly confused now and looks back to to no way and to oh grace and and says wait. I'm i'm not, okay. So i thought the sky was our target of kind of like looks like it, is he not? Well, the start off. I believe the only wear after was particularly feminine in characteristic wasn't

08:06

Not the people don't change over time. I'm sure. But still.

08:14

Um oh, what was her name again? Uh, muna sukaru.

08:26

Noise brows are firmly in her hairline. Like that was very good pronunciation, impressive and and accurate. Actually, yeah. Just like. No, don't hurry good. Well, thanks, i took a two years of japanese in high school, but uh, don't know anything about uhion pronunciation.

08:52

I will take your word, don't go looks thoroughly baffled. Uh, before shaking his head and of the nonsense and turning back to a man in the corner. Uh, and said, okay. So, Yeah, who are you? And where do you, do you serve the only of the five storms if not.

09:26

Why did you try and kill us?

09:38

We drove unusukaru underground ages ago.

09:49

Why would you do that?

09:56

But this point, he kind of opens what looks like a powder ring on his hand. Sticks. A long clawed, uh, pinky nail into it and snorts some of it and then licks his nail clean.

10:19

We needed a place to live and the only we're not using this tower any longer.

10:34

So you and your um, ladies moved in Pushed push muna sucaru. One of the only of the five storms into a cave in the ground.

11:01

I mean, honestly, that's you, that's pretty impressive. I am glad you think so.

11:11

Did you also feel a bonsai tree? Bonsai tree. No.

11:27

But i think i saw one of those filthy hobgoblins sneaking in with one.

11:41

Oh, Gino's. Nothing. This guy's passive. Love beats that so far out of the water you have

11:53

Perfect.

11:58

I i'm trying to figure out if no, i cares enough Franklin because this isn't really helping us

12:13

Haggle. So you beatbox but only um, her entourage into the sellers and just decided to stay here.

12:32

In the middle of kami protected, moms But safer place.

12:44

Yeah, it's not like a lot of people are gonna bother them here until you came. No one bothered us. No, no. I i disagree. And no, he's actually pretty mad at this point. No, you appear to be bothering people. Plenty fine. Given the fact that you had a couple of just what civilians downstairs in chains.

13:17

Looked from the outskirts of the forest and brought here to what for amusement food.

13:35

You already know the answers to this.

13:44

We did not offer terms to negotiate.

13:51

Just because we were losing.

14:05

We offered terms. We offered terms so that we could control the battlefield. The negotiations will show it the big grace wrong exception for me. You're the only one that could possibly notice.

14:36

That is enough to notice the gossamer threads of web descending from above you.

14:50

The what are these things for? Uh, he points set one, uh, whether or not others could see it. And it's like uh this is coming down towards us, then i need everyone to make a reflex save

15:17

Well.

15:24

All right. No way. And gracing, you are not entangled. Oh, well, we all have freedom of movement on though, right? I'm the one that gave you that buff, and i forgot about it. None of you are entangled. There wasn't attempt, it's fun. There was an intense. There was an intense but we're not finished yet.

15:55

Oh, i still have all kinds of buffs on. Can we do a buff check? What's still going? Uh, haste would be gone. Yeah, took that off. Hey, hey, should be on. What? What is that? This would be gone.

16:12

That's your favorite. That's the shadow. Uh, good. Hope would still be on and the heroism. It's still on that should still be on. Okay. Plant ruling. It's still doing the stutter thing. I was checking when we first got in here, it's better than it was, but still not. Let's see, what

16:50

That's actually misses because koya has its deflection bonus from moringa protection.

17:00

But with an 11 to hit her,

17:09

Choco, choco 18 against your flat footed, AC.

17:17

That misses, Welcome. Oh, bum bum. Yeah, that'll do it.

17:42

Become uninvisible. Why does the damage type say question mark strength? Because it's strength damage, six strength damage. Yep, that's shadows.

18:00

Um, i want everyone to know. This is an unmodified encounter from the book and not any home group bullshit from me. I don't doubt it. Okay, o g. 20 to hit your blood for the AC. Uh,

18:27

Do we be rolling initiative? By the way, i'm getting there. Surprise round out of the old out of the way.

18:38

Boom.

18:42

Boom. Boom. Oh,

18:50

Yep. So, you guys see this? This like shadow a few behind annoy and she goes for a sword and just

19:28

Wait, zero you die? Yes. You. You see it? Like a almost like a silhouette of where she was stood there for a second and then it just vanishes and she's on the ground. Not moving stone cold.

19:50

Did you still have any mirror images of

20:02

I mean one more right.

20:13

This is all very terrifying but i greatly enjoy whatever blur i know i'm enjoying this visual it's really. Um, that is their, that is their blur and mirror image spells that are going. So, uh, you will find that in the token magic fx folders, you can put the macro onto your hot parts.

20:41

So what ap do you guys want to play after we wipe right here it's not over. Um because can bring someone back to life, it can bring six people back to life. It can bring one person back to life and it only needs to bring one back to life.

21:06

Like this is not a this is not an unsolvable, it is a bad encounter and i was so scared of it. I was actually talking with Abby about it about how afraid of this encounter. I was.

21:23

Yeah, i figured that might happen, which is why i'm getting enchilad about the fact that i'm currently out of this encounter potentially the AC, um, let me put this character. So is no way, also a shadow now, no, the shadow companions of shadow dancers, do not have the ability to create undead.

21:46

The other problem is their boss.

22:06

He gives them all haste. Yeah.

22:17

So remember how i was talking about kingmaker?

22:30

I am. I, i am scared for this encounter. I'm not gonna lie. Did did he also just give haste to a bunch of us? No, no. Unfortunately, the template is sort of drops. Well, the haste spell doesn't specify its allies per level. It says creatures per level. One creature per level, which is which you target?

22:55

Yeah, it's not like a chain reaction, it's not it's not a blanketed area, boundary. Just doesn't have a way to do that for first edition. Yeah, it does mean. That at least one of the shadows doesn't get his, it's true.

23:24

I don't know. Oh uh yes. But not yet, you don't really high for all of those. I'm gonna just you and damage. I'm gonna go create the feature for free action. Crying cry. I want it on a t-shirt like on. Ironically, i want free action to cry like and also doesn't help that i've killed two players into the last two weeks.

23:54

Um,

23:58

Like, it's spring {question-mark}.

24:10

Also looks a lot worse than it is this okay. It's checking on the ability zip, i think one strength, it's zero. You just become unconscious, not dead. Shadows, shadows, specifically say you hit zero. Reduces your to zero. You're dead. Hmm. Okay.

24:32

This must be what enemy NPCs feel like. Yeah, pretty much a little bit. You are immediately surrounded by blurred hasted mirror imaged strength damage dealing fucking ninjas.

25:00

Uh, and their sorcerer leader. Yeah, exactly.

25:15

Yeah, technically speaking, this encounter looks a lot worse than it is. Uh, i i would give suggestions but i'm dead.

25:31

Does youtube die? No, well then you can talk to us. Youtube is probably like youtube's just like kick them.

25:50

I can't talk for youtube, but i can tell you what, no, it would think. And no, it would think, uh, get rid of the shadows. Dancers are not that dangerous fruit. This is this new turn showing animation? Yeah, you like that?

26:14

Nifty. Go to your first. So let's start with. Do we think we all have our weapons out or? No, because we climbed up here and we're talking. It's not what you put our weapons away. I i wouldn't think you put your weapons away. Okay, well then oh she put his weapons away climbed up and then pulled them back out.

26:36

Uh, okay.

26:40

Wow, all right.

26:51

There's a pillar here, right below. Can i attack that shadow?

27:01

Yeah. Okay, we will start there.

27:14

Oh, she will, that's not the right button. Oh, g. Will my goodness today is going great.

27:25

Over his sword that shadow and challenge it. For killing away.

27:42

Evil the shadow? Yes, very much so.

27:53

Okay, we're full attacking that shadow.

28:00

The first one, if it hits will include the eight challenge damage in the effect notes.

28:11

A phone.

28:17

Oops, it

28:21

Okay. And now that OG has avenged. No way. He will jump off this fucking bridge.

28:32

No, uh, that's OG's turned

28:45

That is a really cool turn animation. Actually do a good job at keeping track of the number of rounds and such tikuna's sensu gives me the ability to cast calm emotions once a day. If i put that here it would hit. Uh it's a 20 foot radius spread. It'll hit this guy and then these three right?

29:17

Um, and that stops them from doing anything violent as long as we don't attack them, if i'm reading this, right?

29:33

Fucking send it. Um, only to put calm emotions on this on the spell sheet, which is weird because i don't actually. Um and using using an item to cast a spell is a that's it. Does that kind of like a spell like does it provoke a taxable opportunity? Do i have to concentrate to do it?

30:03

Uh, that is the number of good questions that varies between most items, but the for the fan, no, i don't think so.

30:22

Girl car emotions on there.

30:42

You will have to concentrate on it though.

30:51

Pastor level 11. So it's a so it's uh it's a second level spell. Concentrate. Come on. Um, oh, well before i do that, uh, move action to start a bartic performance. So everyone will get uh, inspired courage because i can do that as a move of action. And then i will attempt to concentrate.

31:19

Please don't family. No no you don't. You don't have to roll a concentration. Check. You just have to concentrate to maintain the spell. Oh okay. Okay. Which in the case of channeling it from the fan involves waving the fan. Okay. Okay. Well, circle begins aggressively waving in this direction to try and calm these four creatures down.

31:43

A shadows are on dead. Right dental waves, gentle shadows are undead. Yes so so friends so as a dirge bar, this does affect the shadow. Okay? No. Because the spells from the item, not you.

32:04

It is not part of your class features, your class features. I'm notified thing items. Oh, first edition.

32:19

I'm gonna make sense someone that wasn't you. That doesn't know how your beautiful around of magic works and made this item in this way. Oh definitely. It's just this is a very first edition conversation. It's like oh no, the concentrating is to continue. Waving the fan. Not a concentration.

32:36

Check everybody. And also your dirge barbness does not affect the the fans abilities. I'm just so back here. Wondering how noise, trip along the river of souls is gonna go. This is great. Just,

32:56

Uh, what is the dc? Uh, i'm trying to figure that out. Uh, it's the base DC of whatever the the spell is if it does, okay? So that's a second level spell. So we do a 14, 14 sounds right now, it would only be a 14. Really two, plus the minimum ability modifier required to make it, boom.

33:29

But the center one others in her assault. And what about the big guy? He just continues smiling hungerly like he's going to devour you.

33:54

Oh mom, i'm really sorry guys. I, i thought i didn't, i one, i didn't realize the dc would be that low one. Two like didn't realize that. My abilities wouldn't apply to it. Uh, choco apology. Accepted now get to kill him. That was that was my turn. That's why i'm apologizing.

34:17

I probably just doomed us all. I wasted my turn to shut off. One character. That wasn't even a big threat. No, no, they're threats. I just said they aren't the biggest ones. Okay. Koya will win this whole fight. Watch you also just did something to her sister the year.

34:38

This one's primary target now, and that's some missing.

34:47

Something is happening that's so fucking long enough. That's i don't like that. Just i hate it.

35:03

That's like the opposite of who's that pokemon? That's like who's gonna murder. You don't fucking want this. Oh, sweet! Fucking jesus. I'm sorry there must be some kind of math error there. This is a that doesn't look no. Why? Hold on? Hold on, hold on. Way too much. I had to double check.

35:34

That is not. No, no no, no. He is a 12th level caster though. Okay.

35:49

Why is there there's a five in the bonus formula for his cast, level, for some reason. And why? I don't know, Jason, that is not the reflex. Save, i wanted you to fail. Uh what's the tc? Because i do a good phone. A stick and spells.

36:11

There we go. Oh yeah. This is a 21. Much better. Okay, and 20 points of damage slower christ. What is that role? We will five six six, five, five, four, five four. But that's just to the primary target and unfortunately ochi is the primary target. I'm

36:40

I click to reflex save and it's not going through for some reason. Boom. So grayson. You actually do you provision. You don't have a vision, right? Uh, so you only take half of that. So, 26 points of damage.

37:06

Um, chain lightning says that the secondary bolts deal as much as the primary. Oh shit. I've been doing that, like, 3.5 this entire time.

37:20

Turn lightning is a very good spell, it's a worthwhile spell. Now i would say actually that is also super unfortunate. Let me, i also hit the reflex save button. Oh, there we go. They started going. Uh, you guys might want to hit it again then because those were on the go and call you

37:51

No, i'll make out. You rolled an actual 20. So, you take half damage,

38:00

And press the reflux button twice. Now, don't press the one in chat. Just roll. The regular one because it went right away from me, okay?

38:15

Okay, i made it safe. I'll show those sheet. It's it's still. Oh, there it is. So i'm gonna assume a 25 is to save, so it's 26.4. Do i 26 damage, right? Yeah, just click the the half button next to the damage.

38:36

Oh yeah, look, old damage.

38:47

Uh, and yes. So here is what Akinosa looks like in his hybrid form, which is and nobody looks like right now and it's pretty horrible. Uh, and he's just sort of flying over there in the air, uh, with a half dozen other images of him going. Oh great.

39:19

Yeah. So that was that was his turn. It was a good turd. It was a good like a hundred damage at least, uh, shoko. Let me see if i can push for you. I can you take half damage. Oh shoko did roll, he got it. Oh it did go through top damage.

39:41

I'm trying i okay i've apply half twice now. You have your token selected right now. I selected it for the second one.

39:58

But i have damage. Okay? All right. Well, uh, if you die all the sudden, just let me know.

40:12

So this customer is the one that's charmed right, customers? The one that's sharp calmed.

40:23

This one right here.

40:29

Well, attack on og.

40:36

Isn't as bad as it looks many have changed with a near full damage like chocolate my chain line. Right. You could have not rolled faces the maximize if on my colon grayson just absolutely destroyed the shadows before they can move. And that is not, right?

41:13

She's going to smite the shadow and imagine why there will be no holding back. Wow, no.

41:33

I just applied all that damage to herself. You don't do that.

41:47

Which damage? There we go. I'm gonna go destroy. Is that shadow grayson uh crescent is going to attempt to destroy the one next to queer to that our healer doesn't go down.

42:10

Unbelievably nice. Thank you. Chris, boom, boom. Unbelievably dates.

42:25

And you don't have ghost touch currently correct. Correct. Okay. So your third arrow, drops it, all right, and then i'll turn to the one next to me for the last two arrows.

42:51

Floats but still going make your life damage.

43:00

There is some leg with the damage applying. Yeah, i'm also trying to hit intern in. It won't seem to go through.

43:11

Don't talk shit about it. The more we talk shit about it last time. The worse. It. God, that's there. Uh, i love how the stuff with transparent backgrounds looks.

43:30

Big gun. They're super big gun. Uh, she's calm but there now. Yeah, he

43:43

Boom. Boom.

43:48

So, she kind of shakes her head then and just sort of depths backwards. In vanishes vamoose's.

44:13

Hello. Koya, dr. Coldest turn. Okay chance. If we have a chance,

44:28

Gosh, there's no one. Why do you live this one? Cleric be so unbelievably based really like this was when sans has her throat. Her star knife. Instead of healing? What? No, this is when the spider legs pop out of koya and it turns out she's been a spider.

44:54

Um favorites and it's just coya. It's just clear. You thought it was originally but no. No, it was always quite there by the time. A roustically comes around. Koi is already deaden. His herald. What did you do in the afterlife? I became muffler. You try, uh, koya can't use breath of life because nobody died to strength damage.

45:20

So, her body needs to be repaired. I didn't realize how low everyone was. Yeah, so yeah, it clear. It's just gonna double channel. Oh, she has three channel energies left. Um, hell yeah. So she every turn this has gotten a little bit worse force. Yeah, just a little. She's gonna double channel to heal.

45:55

Yep.

46:02

Yeah. Anything i could suggest is um, secure mod mass is like fifth, right?

46:11

Something.

46:20

No, it's sick. Put cure. Light mass is yeah her channels are better than cure light mass yeah but you can damage while you're healing that is a super thick girthy channel, right there. That's also a fair point. I had never thought of that. I, i may be dead right now, but consider me myself.

46:46

Your spiritual advisor for five seconds like you can move channel and do that and then proceed to do cure, which is 1d8 plus 10. I think for you right now. Yeah. So, the standard action here, the first one that did 11, we can just ignore that one. I will take it off my character.

47:12

You're you're about to get healed for probably more so we're taking the 28 you are getting the 28 because that was from move action channel boom. So many things have templates.

47:32

And then everyone gets that 18 plus that thing needs to make a will save. Yes, it do. Oh, look a conveniently. Place will save it failed, it dies uh as arcs of starlight and positive energy race out of koya, hitting all of you and the shadow, only the shadow, instead of healing burns into oblivion, screaming and pain.

48:03

For all eternity. My work here is done for the window. Oh gee i don't think of aggressive tactics. I'm sorry. 47 heels. Pretty good. Uh, i'm gonna go appears to still be at like three hp, though. I haven't applied it to her yet. Give me just one moment. Do not join me in the afterlife.

48:27

We don't have snacks.

48:34

Ochi. Yes, i was just making sure we were ready. I i'm going to spend a key point, one day eventually, there we go to do more attacks since i'm gonna just be hopefully deleting some images here.

48:58

Get him champ.

49:10

Okay. And then we can roll on a bunch of concealment and images and whatnot. I guess let's do your 20%. Confillment first. So which one is the hundred? Is it? The two dice at the end? Or do i have to do are just kidney chin.

49:33

There's one. All right. Blur goes through for ease of everything. All of them are going to be, all them are going to be what you cut out again. They're all going to be ones. Okay, image. Another hundred i couldn't.

50:04

Boom. But you were oh god that's so awkward. I'll still say you popped an image, though. A 19 does not hit right for the haze. That is a botch show. Unfortunately, you get nothing for that one, right? Well, we did our best five. It is easily within five. You know?

50:28

That's fine. She's got three images left. Okay, i'm not trying to kill the party. She'll go.

50:46

Um,

51:18

Reaction to cry uh someone called trading or what's fall on my incapable casting any other spells. No you can. You just can't cancel other things with concentration. Did you take the feet to be able to do your hand signs with one hand while you wait for the fan? What ignore them?

51:41

He is. That's pretty entertaining. Actually, you could do the naruto versus sasuke. Where he uses his one. Okay, i'm ignoring it. Now, i was waiting for it like,

52:03

Um,

52:07

All right, so can i get a check to try and identify what akinosa is?

52:16

And and arena. They're all around years. Uh, okay. Well, i'm going to attempt to target the spill casters will save, which is always a fun. Always, yeah. Uh,

52:43

Um, i'm going to attempt to acrobatics to get past the, the um, this one. Where's where's my acrobatics?

53:00

Well, probably not.

53:08

Wait, where are you going? I was, i was, i'm stepping around and like approaching, uh,

53:20

Uh, this fellow. Okay, she's still comes so you don't. They need to make an acrobatics for her. Well, yeah. But the one that was diagonal to me the one next to Grayson.

53:37

Oh, did you not favorite step? Uh no. I'm i have to oh okay, move action. So i can very well that is that is not enough, unfortunately. Yeah. Not by a bit also that botch was barely within five.

54:02

Yeah, even though she was targeting the shadow underneath you area,

54:18

Surprise. Okay. Okay. Just don't. Let me move why? What? Why? I'm just gonna maybe this will do it know that won't do it. Uh, it's not select target. It's not select token. It click drag is giving me up the selects thing, the the click drag to select x tokens.

54:51

It's not letting me. Select show goes token and drag him up and you're just left. Clicking. Yeah. Okay. Now now it's working. Okay. I might have been because of the shadow underneath you to let me get that thing out of your way.

55:12

Yeah, that might have, uh,

55:27

Don't go is looking to get right up next to cozy up to the do our wellcaster here. So he's in a bit of a weird space. I can't quite tell where he is. He's sitting on that big-ass chair. Well, yeah, but what square is he in? We'll save this one for ease of brain power, verify all over again.

56:19

It's going much better than i thought it would go. So,

56:27

My opinion really did change immediately after that chain. I think it is now back to being like that.

56:53

Yeah, i think, i think that works. I think that works. Uh, i'll be making a concentration. Check to attempt to cast without provoking. Well, unless does it look like? He doesn't have a melee attack, he's an hour later, you would know that he does. All right. Well, then we'll try to concentrate on a second level spell.

57:21

All right.

57:34

So that'll be DC 23 for him.

57:46

He holds his hands up to his chest as though terror has gripped. Him.

58:01

And then he's kind of screams the the tion version of booga booga and jumps at you and the major image shatters as it touches you

58:17

The major image illusionary. The actual dude is up here. It wasn't. Ah, what about my tattoo when i have known that he cast an illusion spell. No, because he didn't cast it while you were within the range fine. You win this round. I'm gonna get my money's worth out of that tattoo.

58:49

One of these days. I thought about giving it to you to make this fight a little easier uh but i feel less bad about not doing it and then it would have triggered for every other revolution spell currently going like when they were cast not while they're going, right?

59:04

Just every time somebody casts an illusion spell. Oh, geez. Arm lights up which is difficult around like Shoko and no way and stuff. Some of them are felt like abilities, so it doesn't. But yeah. Yeah we have any way to get to the sky if he's casting out of greater and disability i don't think any of us have a an easy way to see invisibility.

59:27

I think not invisible. Oh, he's he's not, he's just flying over there.

59:39

It, i just completely missed that. Yep.

59:51

These things happen. Yeah, it's a hectic situation. Don't worry about it. Boom. Boom. Kill the priestess. Oh, i should. Probably i'm gonna mention this, just to be cool. I'm sure you remember to give them both negative levels for losing the competitor. Boom, you know what? No, i didn't actually i'm helping that was a very cool thing to do.

01:00:24

All i can do back here. Put those on them really quick. Pop snowy on the face.

01:00:46

Negative levels all around.

01:00:53

And then this one greyson. Do you have snapshot yet?

01:01:01

Um, i have something that's like it. So oh you also have an arm strike. So yeah it has like also all she needs to do is fight with steps so i don't know what i'm freaking out about.

01:01:17

Thank you.

01:01:23

Power attack, all attack. Boom, both of those, it

01:01:44

So agonosa kind of just drift flies over here,

01:01:57

Little fox. You amuse me? So, but you do not look like, i think you should, you would be much juicer and easier to eat. Yeah, if you were smaller.

01:02:18

Oh, this actually works out great though.

01:02:26

Because it's starting to shape shift the shape shifter. Yeah. Um okay. Forward to safe isn't working. I guess i'll have to make it out of the sheet, but to be fair, i don't remember what the sheep. Shifters, get someone tries the volume more thing. So if it's the bottom line here, a creature with the shape changer subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.

01:02:53

Oh, he ain't that smart and he on drugs. So,

01:03:00

Just love the idea where he's like, fucking we're doing it. Lie is it's literally written into their tactics as they are opium addicts as also. Why they're sturdy? Oh, no. So do does that force save save or do i get it saves? You're fine. Okay, you do not get turned into a tiny cute fox even temporarily.

01:03:39

He does need to make a check. Boom. Oh gee to the 33. Go through your square. Great question. Cmd plus 5.

01:03:59

Uh, my cmd plus 5 is 34. It does not then and provokes and provokes just from ochida right? I'm pretty sure that beats Grayson, isn't it? Plus two for each additional person close to you, for every person's space to be trying to get through. And she only tried to go through one.

01:04:28

It's it's going through the active. Um, so i get a second. Oh, so it's per threatener. First person that threatens regardless not goes through whose squarely goes. Yeah, it's a plus five versus the target that you're trying to tumble through. But if you're trying to tumble through like two separate spaces, and both of them are covered by two people, the DC comes up by two income.

01:05:07

Oh, maybe give me that percentile rule. Get this bed. Get this bread goes through the boom. She remains one absent image.

01:05:29

And grayson, and i'm shaq, please.

01:05:39

I'm assuming that's what you were attacking with for your attack opportunity. Yeah review. Unfortunately, that is not enough to hit or pop an image. That is her turn. Now, she can fill attack. That's fair. Hold on, shibachis i in the midst of her attempts to tumble. She drops her size to the floor down below her.

01:06:16

Boom.

01:06:30

Yeah, i mayco says spirit gun.

01:06:38

A threely. So, neither amigos raised hit. Jason uh christmas is actually gonna target the flying guy. Echinosa. And get him uchi and deal with the ones that are in melee ranch.

01:07:23

And aren't expected by the blur.

01:07:34

So, echinosa is one the boom. He now only has or images. Three images.

01:07:50

Two images, the fact that these guys would be difficult to hit at all. I find incredibly unbelievable. If they're just no images, ripping lines of opium constantly in here. Yeah, there would be so chill and easy to hit. They are not chill at all, then that is not true.

01:08:17

Do be lost in the sauce, but all of his mirror images are now gone.

01:08:33

To do, this is the one who super chill, still.

01:08:45

Uh actually you didn't maintain that spell last round. Did you? Oh, i can make the check to do so if you want no it's not a concentration. Check. It's a concentration to move action to maintain concentration. No way of the fan. Oh okay. Then yeah, i didn't.

01:09:07

Well, that's very unfortunate.

01:09:26

Okay. It's, it's broken. That's why control z.

01:09:48

It's the boom.

01:09:55

Koi is getting beat up.

01:10:00

Fire did just tell you from being an electrocuted. So, she did and Makes the save, we can see around the 8 poison.

01:10:20

Boom.

01:10:29

Is going to sacrifice righteous might

01:10:45

Boom.

01:10:54

All right, everyone gets to some healing.

01:11:01

I might go kill.

01:11:12

There we go. That is quite a certain.

01:11:22

In his rage over noe getting marked. He's going to continue. Trying to stab everyone next to him.

01:11:36

And we're gonna spend some key points to do. It was extra tax.

01:11:56

And give me that percentile.

01:12:06

Against the first one miss, but we say papamer image, she has two left. Give me percentile.

01:12:18

Download one day two, she has no mere image.

01:12:31

And the last one connects.

01:12:43

Yo go trucker 5. Footsteps up turns around. And i think og is going to be spider racist after this fight serve it. He's like, oh, criminals and drug addicts.

01:13:18

He's going to base his entire perception of a race of people's off of one encounter and anecdotal evidence.

01:13:29

Yeah, sure. It was just gonna turn around and say no not to not in one day and then he is going to bang the ground and hit both of these girls. They will take me, default safe.

01:13:54

Oh, they take full damage in our both knocked from

01:14:15

Just about the only way to knock a spider prone magic magic is.

01:14:27

There we go. I've swung on this one or any a like 10 times and i've hit it once, it doesn't help coaches. Don't don't feel bad about it. Like this is why casters win. I'm not gonna lie this doobie. How it feels on the gm side. Sometimes because most people don't just wonder around with mirror images going constantly.

01:15:07

But you guys killed one of the four strands of gossamer. So they they're murdering you. They big man. And yes, there were always four of them. That's terrible. Um, where am i? What am i doing, right? Both footstep, she's prone. Cheese prone. That's valid point.

01:15:42

She is going to stand provoking from grayson uh i do not have combat reflexes. Oh yeah, hasn't taken one yet.

01:16:01

That's that's a way to go clear. Okay.

01:16:07

Mirror image and blur. Yeah, that's fair. Boom.

01:16:19

Uh, this one hasn't stoppered any attacks yet absent image. Room. So now she makes a single attack against koya, which is better than her triple attacks with power attack. So well, then ellen shebach. Okay, nothin.

01:16:50

I know. No one who though.

01:16:59

I mean, soco just did quite a bit 44 damage to was a, his wife's, does that piss him off? Does he want to target? Shoko a little bit. Yeah.

01:17:15

Boom.

01:17:25

All right, so he kind of makes this awful snorting noise. As he inhales some more opium and then blows out.

01:17:46

Several blasts of fire.

01:17:58

And these are all touch attacks. They're all done. Sex. Am i able to uh um dodging, potassium? No, these those. That's mainly attacks only. Okay. So i, uh,

01:18:17

I think only two of those. Yeah, two of them had. Why do you have so many extra going? Why are your buffs multiplying, please? Stop. Hey, at least it's not as bad as chewy. Right now, boom. She's still up.

01:18:56

Five foot skitter.

01:19:24

And then she casts vanish.

01:19:33

You're just too close. Yes.

01:19:38

Yeah.

01:19:42

Yeah, it does.

01:19:56

Well, i'm attack.

01:20:06

Due to that is a hint 25. Whoo. Or that their six points damage.

01:20:23

Boom, that is a hit. Fortunately one d5 pops it image and i just realized amigo has a shank damage. Yeah i forgot to apply that earlier too. A lot of my stuff would have been two damage less all of my stuff would have been too damage less. I don't think any of it mattered.

01:20:50

Well, i'm decks to hit so yeah. I was about to say, you don't use strength, so yeah, i would have just spent two less damage on my swings. Grayson, uh, continuing on targeting. The akinosa like the crit. Yeah. Oh my oh, possibly two crits. I mean, zc he shoots off every single one of his legs.

01:21:17

Oh boom. Uh, that first crit does not confirm at second crit. Does confirm and delete him. Nope, you want to check again 67 points of damage. Yeah. Oh, okay. He got 12 h3 left, uh and then Chris I'll take a five foot step so that there's space for, uh, oh cheat to move into to for attack if he wants.

01:21:55

You are there their space? I just don't think he wants to step on. No way. Yeah, i've been trying not to

01:22:09

Was thinking if you wanted to detect the one that's next to a Mako. Yeah, i knew what you were saying. He's been a stand up which course provokes from koya. Oh koya already used her. A op. Didn't she? She did and she doesn't have come. Every, i don't know why she would so but it's still gonna go to Monaco.

01:22:34

Yeah.

01:22:42

Only four pops an image, unfortunately.

01:22:52

And then she tries to stab koya which actually hits it's quite. Has the worst they see in the group. Now, that's no way. This is no way. No one currently has object. Dc ac, that is fair.

01:23:16

True, she is not good.

01:23:27

I think the only thing that could possibly make Pathfinder a better game is if there were some way to cut to a cutscene of like Skyrim physics, when somebody dies, like you get hit by big or something and you just fly off and bounce off of rocks and stuff.

01:23:45

Telling me, i mean, you could have, you could have put it as like, no, i just felt backwards into that, shadow just dropped. It's like 60 feet. Yeah, the slow skyrim, drop the ragdoll. And then the fall the fall down the mountain that makes it take like 20 seconds before the reload menus pops up.

01:24:06

Yeah.

01:24:15

I always love to lightning was like the most impactful thing and skeleton physics.

01:24:35

Three. No more images for you.

01:24:46

Boom. Oh okay. You still have one image?

01:24:53

Bringing us sochi seeing with the other one ran away. He is going to take grayson up on his invitation to stand up here and do some stabs on these other ones.

01:25:11

Not spending the key point because i am almost out of them. We do a swing.

01:25:22

I've crept, like almost every time i know. Okay, big mad. All right, give me that. That rule. You're also using a katana which? Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:42

Ups, an image.

01:25:47

Thank you. It's her. It's not a crit unfortunately but it does strike. So that's how she's turn. She'll go.

01:26:06

Uh,

01:26:11

So go what? What's out his wave blade and dashes up to meet this dude because he appears to be but plus 50 feet. So he's a he's on the same plane as me right now. Is, yeah. All right. Right up to the sky.

01:26:31

Uh give me an acrobatics check to stand there. Oh okay. Uh edge.

01:26:44

Okay, you're good.

01:26:50

Pops up like a true swashbuckler show those been working on that acrobatics and climbs. It's the um do not discuss. Yes. Um, all right, let's see if this hits.

01:27:13

Oh, give me that percentile.

01:27:23

You can't write this again. I really can't write this. Uh, don't show go. You go ready up today and he blurs a little too much and you're you're cut narrowly misses back.

01:27:55

Um, um, Yeah, this lady is gonna try and spartan bull rush you up of the ledge there grace in

01:28:20

Uh, no, i cmd is 33. You are an immovable rock as she throws her butt. Throws her body at you. She bounces off as if thou art titan the crackhead at the 7-eleven tries to tackle you but pretty much welfare. She's not.

01:28:47

Uh, it's waves are about to die.

01:29:05

Oh, five foot flutter.

01:29:13

As hymns is flying.

01:29:18

I and as he goes making a jump attack, i wonder the fucking shoko. Just the leaps. After him as he goes uh as he pulls back you see more of the that ash and smoke from the, the opium start to to fall from his hands. And then do you feel a fulminating energy crackling about you as he launches another bolt of lightning past you shoko?

01:29:53

Boom. Grayson, you are the primary target this time.

01:30:09

Oh well, he had another one in the tank. He has three of those spells available to cast because he's a sorcerer.

01:30:31

Put it away.

01:30:43

No, i think so. Uh, i may go take that. I mean about to say, i'm very good.

01:30:56

22 beats. It, it does beat it. So you take half? Yes, unless that'll have pervasion. Thou does not. He looks very frustrated that you have not fallen. As you can imagine, he does not face job position. Very often.

01:31:23

Channel campaign. Go away and we need that space. You're in.

01:31:45

And you become feasible now. Thank you.

01:31:59

Um, it goes sees koya in danger.

01:32:06

Just got well bunch burst. Thank you. All.

01:32:18

Oh, she took care of all of her mirror images, but most fucking blurs are doing work two. So, she only gets stuck by the higher damaging one to be fair.

01:32:38

Take your damage. Thank you grace in, all right. Good trying to finish this guy off so shogo doesn't have to do some sort of density. Come on. It's only like 40 feet down to a bed of rocks. So they're spiked and this will also be using my very last key point, too.

01:33:06

I mean, if i if i like okay you take an extra d6 of damage per 10 feet, you fall onto those spike. I was gonna say, like, if i jump onto the guy, like, doesn't like the would, like, the would be like his fly spill applied to me or like, what i've successfully grapple him.

01:33:31

Bubba. Boom. But that will not be needed. It will not be needed for grace and does not suffer from blur chances and is very first arrow kills him because he had 12 inch feet left, all right? And then the rest will go into the one that is right next degrees.

01:33:52

Each one. Yes. Um, a 23 will unfortunately miss, but the 32 will hit an 18 will miss and a 38 will hit leaving her at one HP.

01:34:15

Oh, well, there's it. Um, and i did hit the intern button, just wait for indication. Why did she died? I think i double clicked or damage.

01:34:42

From the five foot step. Oh,

01:34:51

But through her blinking,

01:34:56

Yeah, that's gonna do it.

01:35:08

And koya drops after the second one ouchy, all right? So at the top of the rounds, uh, as Akinosa spells,

01:35:28

Both will say his spells ended. Now, the body was just sort of hanging there in the air to the final. It's almost the fusion shock, uh, before his body falls all the way to the ground and onto the stone spikes that he felt made with his own shape, spell, uh, impaling, him.

01:35:50

And removing any chance that he might have survived. Uh so no worries about that with this thick of being squelch the remaining three strands of gossamer look over at where he was and let out screams of wailing despair. Good.

01:36:17

No, she can go. Can you make one five foot step during a full attack action?

01:36:28

Correct. Okay.

01:36:39

Now is key point time.

01:36:54

Oh, jeez. Um,

01:37:06

Um,

01:37:10

I'm so sorry. But her last image, just gone. Uh, don't i have to blur first? We're gonna just color left image gun. Okay, just take it. Yeah, that's fine.

01:37:40

And shoko that was i guess i had that comment after all those rolls earlier.

01:37:50

Today because they would have been over so quickly if they didn't have blur and mirror image.

01:38:00

Also, false life.

01:38:06

They weren't fucking around. After you killed one of the gossamers is there.

01:38:17

It's their way to set this up, but i can just hit

01:38:35

I didn't get to there. I could do that and i have 40 feet to do so. So, i will do just that.

01:38:58

What are you doing? I'm moving 40 feet to get to here and then casting thundering drums to hit these two. Again, it's a little laggy for me right now, though. There we go. Okay, do that again. And drop your template now.

01:39:32

Games there.

01:39:47

Okay, that's why it looked weird.

01:39:57

Can we go with the 24 damage? I rolled on the first one instead.

01:40:17

The hems, the damage until it matters. She only had one left so those she did.

01:40:32

And she takes full.

01:40:42

But you just unleash this shock wave and this Renee screams in pain as blood and bones, splinter out of her.

01:41:00

Enter. And then the this one is also pro.

01:41:09

And acting up his gun.

01:41:21

Pro.

01:41:31

Five foot skitter.

01:41:37

Gothmers are terrifying these things. I thought there's terrifying. He's?

01:41:48

But they still have their haste. Nothing. No. Boom, and she misses both of her attacks. Uh, they are very disrespectfully stepping all over no way by the way, every time they chart, Like i really want you to understand just how much they don't like you people, they're stopping all over her.

01:42:20

They really are. Oh, the feeling is very mutual.

01:42:34

Fine. Part spells. Concentration. That's more than enough. Uh so nobody or i may go points at the one that's currently standing on. No way. Get the fuck off her.

01:43:21

Boom, and magic missiles are head up. Like Jason.

01:43:35

Um, looks like it's just the one left. So he will fire at her and she only got two images left.

01:43:46

Boom. Boom.

01:43:55

Okay.

01:44:00

And the delusion of arrows that hit, you managed to both take out her other mirror image pin, harry against the wall and then skewer her through one of her eyes with your final arrow and then the others are kind of just garnished on the top salty.

01:44:21

And this i think is where we will take our break.

01:44:30

Sounds good. What a fight. I'll be back. Can we get the break checker? I wasn't even the boss. That wasn't even the boss, what the fucking tower. Nope. It's the mid boss of the tower.

01:44:47

I would also screaming about that.

01:45:56

15.

01:46:14

And boom, aim returned and low. Please send me friend requests. Someone just asked to join games in disc. I don't know who defeat.

01:46:37

This is my voice. Still sound cool.

01:46:51

That was just sent me a friend request. It is.

01:47:12

All right.

01:47:21

So, let's Get started. Loot. The bodies, something, something, taking all the gear off my character and kicking no way out. And think of this no, full load. First order of business is uh making sure coya doesn't die. Uh, yeah, grace, it starts pulling the potions of cure light, wounds out of the, the bag of holding and we'll feed him to her one by one until she regains consciousness, any uncommony it takes.

01:47:57

We have up to six. Oh i just googled it. Oh yeah it's not actually that far down birds can only negatively. So oh she's gonna run over to somewhere between coyote and away and start weeping some bird tears. Uh, i guess i'll roll the the healing amount.

01:48:29

What are you rolling on? Like you have the the potion in your inventory, that's in the bag of holding. So they're kind of counted separate so we use two of them to get her conscience.

01:48:50

Oh, we should set up a physical version of the bag of holding. But you can just click the use button, physical being a relative term,

01:49:17

But that is enough to get coyote, conscious 13, Philip bringer 25.

01:49:31

Encoyo kind of sits up with a guest.

01:49:37

Oh, thanks shezuru. Uh and then scrambles over to Noe. Can you help her? And again, i googled. It birds can cry and coaches crying. I guess i just don't get to eat today. Why wouldn't you get to eat door? Dash is being shitty like nothing. I'm doing to make the fucking website.

01:50:04

Work is going through either on the web browser, or on the mobile app. They must be getting hit. Then starvation, you'll have to resort to cannibals. Yeah. So she pulls a hand, fold of diamond dust out of her pouch and begin. Sprinkling it on noise corpse.

01:50:37

Dammit koya. We don't need to decorate her. We need to save her and then she looks like she's going to start. Casting. It actually doesn't look like a. Yeah, i don't think we need diamond dust for ability damage. It appears it seems that that's only for negative levels.

01:51:01

Nope, you're right. She sprinkles sparkly powder on her. Anyways, to keep with the cinematic thing i was going for. That's good, that's good. Keep it going.

01:51:16

But before she can begin casting her race dead spell. I'm gonna go reaches into Noah's bag and opens the wording box. Now, i'm not saying we shouldn't use it. We should let's just be careful that there will be consequences for opening that i'm counting on the fact that this was a prison for the only preventing them from sensing any.

01:51:52

Oh, excuse me. I'm counting on this. Having been a prison for the only and then not being able to tell what's happening here.

01:52:07

No way, come with me.

01:52:19

Both dear. Oh dear.

01:52:29

Wonder if he's asking her. If she's accepting the reds or not. Oh geez. Punching the ground and crying bird tears. Right now, i don't care if we have to open the box, get her back. It was not her time. He says to people who are not in this chat, an interesting question.

01:53:14

So you think you're going to steal some other web to craft stuff with racing? I guess it's not stealing if they're dead. Is it stealing if they're dead?

01:54:09

Fail meaning. God.

01:54:41

You must starve magnets. I'll be right back. I'm getting wd-40 for this fucking chair again.

01:54:59

My being.

01:55:38

Safe attach.

01:55:43

That.

01:56:36

Ah, there we go. Look at all this tipping action with no squeaking glorious.

01:57:10

A moments after the wording box is opens. You hear what sounds like a chorus of what voices. Give out a declaration, a proclamation of imperial decree, light, erupts from the wording box and fills. No, way's body in her eyes. Snap open. Oh, thank heavens immediately. You just hear this?

01:57:44

We hear what? Make a cough. Sorry. I had to mute my mic for a second. I busted out laughing when you did that, i mean, what are you expecting? Really. Uh, no, it's fine. I everyone, i think is here for them to know a crying. Yeah. She's she's kind of like tears.

01:58:09

Very much in pain um not moving from that spot on the ground, where she is. That's okay because you're picked up by your kimono wrap thing by a furious looking amigo. You never ever get the scold me again for putting myself in danger.

01:58:42

Well, hi princess. This answer head, pats. You're eliza. Yes, we almost lost. It looks like barely and koya. Well, we did lose you, i look fine.

01:59:06

We're all alive. You're very lucky should not be a shadow, a sacred nimbus.

01:59:17

Check a slumps against the wall and just falls down and looks up the roof.

01:59:27

Um uh knowing you're back to full. Oh yeah, it might be looking a little bit delirious right now.

01:59:42

Uh, because you got a true resurrection.

01:59:51

And then the seal it goes quiet the light vanishes. Uh, and all of you can feel of fading of a presence. You didn't even really know was there completely, but you've now known that you've been connected to the amazon seal this entire time.

02:00:18

But right now it is just the jade seal.

02:00:26

Is not. It was a very bad idea. We didn't have a ton of options. Yeah. So now, the only the first storm know exactly where we are. I don't. Are we certain of that? Oh, i don't think it matters. You shush rest. You literally, i do not, i think it matters.

02:01:07

They knew we were coming to the guy. You were literally dead. What are they gonna do to send more ninja after us? Maybe they'll send the good ones, holy spider bitches, that were better ninjas than any other things. We fought so far. They weren't ninjas and kind of tries, i mean, can you give me back my shirt?

02:01:38

Please tops glaring at you. Like, she's just remembered herself. And that's it on the cheek like next day, but i'm okay. Um, they weren't ninja. They were dancers. There's very distincts difference, and i probably should have warned you about the shadows. Problem, that one was on me.

02:02:16

And then we all say you don't need to talk and then everyone until you've got your strength back. I take a nap right here. We know the the wording still seal still approves of no way.

02:02:32

We should set up camp up here. I think it's a barely easily defended position.

02:02:42

Oh, and you figured out all the irony. Well, there's that and also the um we cleared out all the rna. But uh, uh, the only of the five storms that is however, many floors below us knows that we're here now. So there's a good chance. He might be sending people.

02:03:02

She might be sending people up after us. Okay. I have a lot of stuff to drop in or loot. So this is just off of echinosa.

02:03:24

Spider venom. By the way. Your ancestors are fucking idiot. You're a fucking idiot. Goofiest smile. She can move it.

02:03:47

You should not have done that.

02:03:53

And Grayson i'm not even going to make you role for this in a very well hidden secret compartment in the palan queen palankine, which is, by the way, a beautiful palan king, it's open and gilded thrown like litter with a silk roof and four poles for bears. Worth 2000 gold for its workmanship alone.

02:04:20

Inside this palen. King, you find a red lacquered wedding, trunk, containing three bags of silver bars, two sacks of gold bars, a tool. Toolled leather document box. Containing a scroll of blade barrier, a plain wooden box, containing 10, doses of opium, and, and an elaborately carved. Silver, and jade opium pipe with matching matching, opium lamp.

02:04:44

We're gonna get so fucking, that's the stuff you find in the open. I don't know how you're gonna transfer it an entire pollen key anywhere, but they give you a price for it in case you guys decided you could do it. I guess i i suspect it's if you have anybody with the words.

02:05:08

That much.

02:05:13

Why aren't you letting me copy and paste the loot? You son of a bitch.

02:05:25

02:06:13

Oh well you certainly come around on them. Oh no, i can. I continue to keep my opinion that the comedy were fucking terrifying. And by far that one, once the most terrifying i will ever meet in my life can be held responsible for most of the bad things that have happened.

02:06:50

Yeah. Kimon.su was really hot so he is a call me to a several thousand year old major artifact. See it pretty careful terrifying.

02:07:07

Some reason i cannot copy and paste stuff out of my pdf today. That's unfortunate. Sugar knows nothing about religion, you know, about raised dead smells and he's like. So, you weren't quite ready to quit us then, huh?

02:07:36

And if it wasn't obvious, he served shizarro.

02:07:43

Yeah. Yeah. I i think this this flask of endless sake is just a cooler because i'm imagining she's set up at this point is like the most mechanical movement you ever seen out of her. She's like, Should i have not?

02:08:08

Describes as a feature of the throne, inside of this vault, you find six strings of gold coins, each containing 400 gold pieces. So that is times 400 or 400 times 6.

So, that's the same for the gold one too. Yes and those those are in the the more traditional uh period bars that they used to have.

02:11:56

And the, the golden notices i think the actual shape of buried from king kingdom, but they were, they were small bars that they would trade with. We have 42 doses of opium. Yeah. And or just chunks of metal. Sometimes he was easier to take out the chunk of silver and give it away.

Cultures, like they do, like instead of having like smaller denomination, then the main currency coin which was the penny. They would just cut the penny into pieces. Yeah.

02:15:22

Also after uh i assume playing on it because shoko likes the drums, the 20 pound iron drum next to his throne is a hung, golly wardrom or guangu and functions as a drum of panic.

02:17:00

Oh block. I bet the mako couldn't have even picked up. Yes. My god. The leather is touched, just right? He said it's got heated. Seats is everything. Always so loud. Yes, quiet says but you get used to it. You'll go over there. Having a fucking like orgasm over this drum of penny, it's a very high quality drum, it is a very high quality drum, i can hear the blood rushing to the wrong organs.

02:20:00

So,

Thank you guys are going to camp. Queer will sacrifice her last flame strike.

02:20:14

For another cure. Light wound, mass.

02:20:19

Sure will be fine. We might not be fine. You did open up the wording box and i'm now beginning to get my common sense back and i don't like it to go away again.

02:20:34

He said everything was so chill, a minute ago.

02:20:51

I am.

02:20:58

How's everyone on healing? Oh, g is full. I believe actually still has plenty of second level spells and third level spells so everyone can just top off their hp before bed.

02:21:22

You can get to both first prior in the maker on the face with the Leon has like poop.

02:21:37

Wait play.

02:21:42

So launches hardly on hands. Oh, okay, you two. I was like, what is happening? I don't have a job now. Yes, eventually, they're neat. They're fun and extremely fluffy. It's very helpful. So no way out of curiosity. What did you see when you died?

02:22:18

Not much.

02:22:25

Sorry, did you want a detailed rendition of my journey across the river of souls as i was torn for my own body? No, if we didn't really see much. Then that's that. All right, i'm back.

02:22:47

Welcome back. So it is the kite the tiniest little lay on hands boob greatest.

02:23:00

So if we want to set up campiero, we should set up watches to at least try and keep an eye out for if someone probably sneak up on us up here. Fast. Nursing ideas, believe the capital, but i'm not going to agree with here. Recent catch and she actually rips off her iron goblets and tosses.

02:23:26

I um, because if you wear that thing, you'll have the pleasure of doing what i've been doing for the last x amount of time because it doesn't let you sleep.

02:23:43

Oh, that explains so much about no way as a person. She's just and why would i not want to sleep? She's just always laying down and always mad. Whenever we're not fighting, looks at the party, it looks at Grayson, i'm not gonna lie to you and say that your eyes are perfectly normal for a dwarfuture particular capacity.

02:24:13

But i am going to tell you that they were perfect nearly impossible. So that thing will allow you to try and dream but it'll keep your eyes open while you do it.

02:24:35

I mean, i'll, i'll use it for in here just for making sure nothing happens. But uh you know when we're back at the caravan i i'd rather be able to to fall asleep. If you could just do me a great favor and throw that fucking thing in the fire, i'd be real appreciative.

02:24:56

That the bunny that says that? Yep.

02:25:03

It's useful greasing looks down and he's like oh no, this is like constellucinations. Not funny, just talking.

02:25:17

What bunny choco says to Grayson? Nope. All right, i guess we're seeing crazy stuff now.

02:25:31

So yeah, the the exact thing that it does.

02:25:40

Down the resonance but yeah the resonance for that particular ironstone. That's in it. It allows you to while you're a, while, you're sleeping instead to keep your eyes open and fully aware

02:25:58

So you're still sleeping, you just get to be on water at the same time completely aware of what's happening. And can react to deny yourself and don't take the negative 10 perception. Mmm creepy. All right. Uh yeah, definitely not wearing this in the caravan. I uh i do. I don't think, uh, Kelly would appreciate it.

02:26:26

Every time she woke up. Uh, see me with my eyes open staring at her.

02:26:34

I'm not it's considered romantic by someone told who and who whatever you say it. Probably earned him a punch in the face, while fully asleep.

02:26:51

Don't recommend it. I've spent some time until dane and hand door. They're weird down there. Help us tell those she's been a nordic type though. I know potentially to death. Please don't so good did not say she would find it romantic. He said some people do throughout like their mates always aware.

02:27:26

I'm going to bed together anymore. Like nothing. You can see the breath like leaves. No ice. Looks like i am. I had to use done for today and just funks out pretty much where she's sat over gone. Is the pollen coin company to sleep on. Oh very if you don't mind an opium den, Nice.

02:28:02

Cushions there's some occasional burns and stuff on the fabric. But uh, everything is made of silk.

02:28:17

I make sure not to add the pollen coin to the uh loot list until somebody comes up with a specific way for us to take it.

02:28:29

Uh maybe we could lower it down on the silk almost spider silk that is i don't think we're getting it out of here.

02:28:43

They'll come to think of that, show. Go talks with his eyes closed. Those arms folded as these leaning back in the the comfy pound one. Oh, come to think of it. I don't think. Yeah, without much avoid to untangle it showcas over there laying in like exciting, both of them.

02:29:05

Yeah. He's sitting in the only way we could just sell those drums you picked up. They look pretty unremarkable. Yeah, it showcas laying in the only thing. That's close to a bed already tonight. You telling us how we're gonna look like. He does. He looks like he's going to tell you off, but then just a wave of drowsiness comes over him and he just sort of grumbles.

02:29:34

This shares too comfy. For me to take your bullshit right now. Grayson bullshit. I mean, look at them. They look on remarkable.

02:29:48

If they wake me up, i'm going to stop both.

02:29:56

Okay, i'm hitting the rice button, considering the description of the drums says they are unremarkable in appearance.

02:30:14

Do i get strength back for sleeping? Charcoal is already asleep.

02:30:24

He is saying, okay everyone can go ahead and hit their breast buttons.

02:30:34

Uh and luckily for you you have cleared out the entire upper levels of the house of withered blossoms.

02:30:52

And when you,

02:31:01

Really. That wasn't all of it. There's more.

02:31:11

More. So yeah. What's finders the webs above you? Like in the roof above you, uh, contain a narrow wooden shelf hidden, just below the roof, which holds a magnificent small ligard screen worth, 30 gold pieces. A bolt of very fine, turquoise silk worth 200 gold pieces.

02:31:40

Turquoise silka, an ancient tapestry depicting, a lion embroidered on blue. Silk a pair of embroidered silk. Loaded shoes, set with opals a blue, silk robe with a dragon figure embroidered and gold thread. A porcelain tea set, depicting eagles with silver and platinum handles a carved. Jade dragon brooch, for jade hairpins, a carved soapstone piggy.

02:32:11

Well, it just says pig, but i made a piggy, uh, a jade belt, buckle depicting a demonic face, and a jade-belt hook in the shape of a heron

02:32:28

Well, this, uh, this fits perfect because, uh, greyson was gonna ask in the morning, uh, if no, it could go up further and see what was up above. So yeah, we probably would have found that

02:33:00

This is what i thought does.

02:33:11

Uh, and Grayson

02:33:15

I'm gonna go kind of titles up to you. Can we do since that with the lion and the, the turquoise silk?

02:33:33

Uh, sure. Just just, you have something in mind i do but we'll talk about it later. When certain people aren't within earshot and she purposely looks at no way. He was definitely within hearing range with Noah's perception. No, no i no longer has a gauntlet on and isn't wearing her glasses of present.

02:33:54

So i mean that's fair. Um, whatever seen her frankly. She is trying to be pretty stealthy about it though. The rest will talk back in. The caravan i might go is very stealthy about it.

02:34:16

Yeah. Back at the caravan ancient tapestry.

02:34:31

Pair of silk, Lotus shoes set with opals. This shit out here be fancy. Y'all do the silk robe with a dragon figure?

02:35:01

95.

02:35:47

You know, any pig? Chain belt.

02:36:03

You guys can continue talking. I'm almost done.

02:36:11

How do you spell arena made their way around made over their way around? The the more on the second level, do you think they listen to them or points is feeling? Yeah. Did you climb up? No way. These are the hole in the roof.

02:36:41

Climbed all the way up and then probably on to the roof. And just like that is, it is an absolutely astonishing view. You are a beating the air over the fourth of spirits, which is in many ways. One of the most ancient and primingal forests on all of galarian, aside from the blight that's currently surrounds the house of withered blossom.

02:37:09

I, it is a verdant landscape for as far as the i can see in every direction. Even this how you can. Barely see the glittering of the seas off to the west and east. I will chalk this view up to being the third. Most beautiful thing i have ever seen in my life.

02:37:31

I just wish i didn't have to die. That's it.

02:37:39

Oh, here's your stuff.

02:37:47

It's like up there for a little bit too long he's like, oh, right, yeah.

02:37:54

I guess the morning after shoka would just ask no way. So what you see? What lies beyond the pale.

02:38:12

What is your like looks like rice? I'm like what are some people's session with?

02:38:20

I'm just curious. What do you want there to be?

02:38:30

Choco thinks.

02:38:37

Well, certainly like there to be something. You think it'd be pretty terrible? If it was just lights off forever.

02:38:54

That's interesting. Choice of lord. I'm supposed

02:39:09

There's not much to talk about. And maybe, maybe that's a good thing.

02:39:29

You want me to go into detail about how i probably shouldn't think that dark and infinite places or actually really comforting. And that sort of, i don't have to leave here, kind of way. There's no sound there. That makes you hate things that are in your immediate proximity. That was not anything.

02:39:55

You have to worry about just

02:40:03

It's awful.

02:40:10

I never want to go back there.

02:40:19

How long were you there?

02:40:27

No. Don't mean like, objectively? Like what it was for us? Like what? What did it feel like for you?

02:40:36

They don't keep clocks.

02:40:43

Thank you.

02:40:50

So, what was it like, coming back. This is no way the white loud.

02:41:03

Right. Everything, here is very

02:41:27

Just loses her. Shit. Oh, go rolled his eyes and even gets a snicker out of. Grayson keep that up and we're leaving you there next time.

02:41:52

That does not that. That one gets a genuine honest, proud. There's like, i don't want you to have to do that again.

02:42:12

Oh,

02:42:16

My bad guys, mark, i didn't mean it like that. I just It was adjust. I didn't actually you know, that literally everyone in this room would die for you, right? Like we don't need to say that out loud. I have stuff. I have to do.

02:42:43

Is it? Choco looks around.

02:42:54

I know i die for any of you. It's very how many times you guys have all put your lives on the line. I would die. Christmas seems to be inspecting the pillar next to him very thoroughly. And uh, and does not respond. I have to but i thought for even a moment that there was no other way to save one of you than to sacrifice my own life.

02:43:20

I would do so without hesitation. Yeah, you're not allowed to do that and i have to keep her alive.

02:43:30

That's illegal, it's legal. I haven't heard anything from a channel while i'm and he's been talking the entire time. Yeah, yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. God damn it. I've said so much. It's been at least since like what the end of the battle, i think. Can you guys hear me now?

02:43:56

Your microphone just isn't being picked up by you the address when we still can't hear you. Like, we're not ignoring you and i oh no. Oh, it hasn't really been some in the hall.

02:44:12

And it's funny GP. Chococast's commune with birds. Oh, as a free action. Uh, i makeup will also pay the amount for the, the broach and the hair pins and the uh lion thing. And the

02:44:43

So, 200 208.

02:45:20

Cloth for the project so you can just add 580 instead of those, okay? And i'll take, uh, yeah. Okay, don't open dress. So the piggy is 25 gold. Uh, that's because i was getting back into the check. Can you hear me now? You know, still nothing. Oh, my sweet god.

02:45:38

Sorry, from

02:45:46

Don't know. The is your microphone. Just not being picked at though. Like it isn't even lighting up green. So yeah, push to talk active.

02:46:17

And you hear us.

02:48:20

Check. Check. There is my god. Okay. So, some notes, uh, the dying for each other stuff. I was repeatedly saying like, well no, i have to protect Lady of Maaco if for some reason she was dead and i had no duties that, of course, i would die for any of you.

02:48:44

But i have stuff, i have to do. That was the first thing i said, right? After Shoko, said that was a uh, i have stuff. I have to take care of.

02:48:58

Um and then i'll go and wave off the concern and say yeah. Yeah i guess, i guess that's true for you. You guys, you guys could take care of him and go without me. I'm sure and then also asked about the strength damage for resting. If we got one back i don't know how that stuff works.

02:49:18

Yeah, you you automatically restore one per day of rest. Um, and then anything more, you'll need to heal. Yeah. But no, i was talking the whole time. I don't know exactly when i cut out but apparently it was a long time. It was a long time back. I'm so sorry if you turn around the or on the side train of like oh.

02:49:43

So what's it like to die? No, way's just gonna get real sad. No, i definitely ask that before anybody else asked it also. Yeah, yeah. She, she's just like. That is not, you do not want to know what it is. Like, oh, and then i commented on. Shoco, taking the only bed and just the only bad like place to sleep and choosing it for himself.

02:50:09

I was like, hey what we have a princess? Like why do you get to sleep on the valley? No, the princess gets to stay over here and be my pillow for the next 24 hours. I just came back from dying. Yeah, i thought shoco was just doing like a power move.

02:50:24

He's like anyways i'm real beat. You guys just talking over me, you know, mako just telekinesis in the off of the edge. Yeah, there's a fuck out my chair. There was a few things where i was like, all right. My joke was just aren't fucking landing tonight but yeah, you know that was not that was not the intention.

02:50:47

I should just disconnect and reconnect discord. After every time we take a break that's probably what i did to do. Probably, it seems. And for those that don't remember, there's updated token art for, for way in now. Yeah, with his pipe and his little faux, but no, i and her still half delusional state, just our asks, like so, what's the deal with?

02:51:11

You know, the whole? Why the fuck from Shazier and tsukio? Felt the needs to just annoy us with your presence. Not that you're annoying, but you know what i mean, talking is very difficult. To tell them is very complex right now.

02:51:33

I mean, youtube kind of just smiles. You know why i'm here i was very up from with that from the beginning.

02:51:43

I'm here for you. Yes, i got that. I was about to jewel something but i forgot what it is. Oh, now i remember and i'm fucking here because she zuru is the patron of minkai and the one and only remaining blood air to the run of minkai decided to go walking across the night shelf.

02:52:16

Yeah. Anyways, you want to do something? Like me is there like a reason she sent? Uh like not like a big glorious, golden host of warriors. And instead something, something helps those who helps themselves ochi. Oh gee bird brain come here. Come here. Okay. Yeah i'm real close. I want to tell you a secret.

02:52:44

What's up, grabs? The hold of your beak and shuts it. And it's just like, fuck off. It's a good question.

02:52:57

Did you need more assistance then? Several major artifacts uh ohti tries to pull your hand off of his weak. I don't know if he succeeds, he has seven strength right now. Um, but he goes on a little tangent and logist of it is like no for real. Like if the gods did everything for us, what free will would we have?

02:53:20

It's our victory to win and to do, right? And do good blah blah, blah blahful, good stuff.

02:53:32

Show. Go looks. It's also that the other gods keep them in check. No, no shizuru is the coolest one. They couldn't do shit. There's a reason. She is called the empress of heaven. Yeah, it does not mean that the other gods of darkness aligned against her. If given a reason, could not cause her great distress.

02:53:56

I'm having such a hard time getting into his accent a month through here from the point. My voice isn't cool anymore. So this is fine. We're all. Yeah, it's like, yeah. Maybe you were actually having some distortion through your bluetooth then it's it's i think it was not that like i'm using the bluetooth headphones, but i've been playing bluey.

02:54:20

I don't know if you guys are familiar with the show, one monitor for my ton, as he lays on the bed. And then playing king maker with the sound run through a bluetooth headphones so that he can listen and i can listen and they're like up here above my desk and i bet they like got jostled and then connected and became my default like audio device or whatever.

02:54:41

It's, there's so many fucking menus on windows 10. Just to change that. Yeah, it'll be. It'll be something in the kodak control. This this lame, i have too many things going on, because i have the audio interface and i have to like, use voice meter to change what stuff is doing, even to get Pathfinder king maker to play sound, i have to have like two programs running, just to get it to come out of my speakers.

02:55:05

It's kind of stupid. It is. Anyways, technical stuff. Yeah. Oh, she's gonna pull out his raven that he's had this entire time and just talk to it so he can feel cool. All these other people. I think it's really funny that you just have a raven, like, in your coats.

02:55:28

I don't know. I have a familiar satchel. So i have like a little bag that stays on my horse, most of the time. I know you can turn him into a familiar if you want. There's a feet chain for it, right? No, no. Oh, geez already. I went down too many feet tax is in what?

02:55:45

Oh, she wants to do this. Swing is sorted stuff because that's way cooler, but he's gonna pretend sometimes, he's just gonna tell me if it's fun. Actually that much again, i will not do it. I will talk to my raven who can't talk to me. Choko, casting with birds soco, will not waste a second level spell, slot to help you talk to your pets, please.

02:56:10

I'll do a voice for him and everything. I'll have him scream and pick for freedom. I never trained him or anything. I just stole him from Ravensburg. Yeah. I have a familiar satchel and i just drag him around with me so i can feel cool. Like everybody else. It's really don't want to do from from neo.

02:56:33

The ninja who just has a cat in like his coat. It's really fucked up honestly, when i think about it but his the raven would literally just be like, i don't even know this guy where am i? It was very cold for like, four months. He just leaves some food in this bag.

02:56:53

I never see the light of day.

02:57:00

Yeah, that's what you would hear. If you cast me in with birds, No, she's just like oh, he's so cute. Yeah, that's what.
