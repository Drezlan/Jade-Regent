00:00

I just found that it's great. Yeah, i want i want a whole session of like grace and alone like we get separated from him in the capital city. Just gotta make his way without knowing how to speak to a day of grace navigating. I just want to see him get into kasai.

00:19

I i need to see grace and get into the captains, completely ignorant of a language. I need to know. I think that Grayson has the right idea with that because one of the, my favorite moments in this entire campaign is when zyobi was like touching ochi and communicating with him telepathically and i was trying to role play a game yesterdays to explain.

00:43

What's i hope he was telling me and i think that's about how that would go the entire time. He's just going around like Plato here albanio, you know, like Don't de esta la biblioteca.

01:04

Would be a strong castle. So looking at the looking at this map of the place we're going through and comparing it to the big TN map. That pies out just put out. Uh the differences are interesting. What do you mean that? They just put out they've just put out.

01:20

Two, two brand new or announced to brand new teens. Yeah. Books coming out what? I've been. Yeah. Pulling lots of mountains and stuff for the wiki. So that would be really sick to see some new. Yeah, there's only like the two, there's like one zoomed in for this and then one overall tienshaw map.

01:41

Yeah, there's definitely expanding and nutrien ap. Yep. Really are gonna pay more attention.

01:58

Whatever those books i guess mount. By the way, back end of this year, going into next year, uh, god that's so far away. That won't be useful for this game at all. Yep, i think the primary difference, i see in the terrain. Here is uh, they seem to have like closed up this plane and made it like a whole mountain range.

02:21

I think it already like it already is supposed to be an elevated. Yeah, because you can see where they put the the hills and stuff here. Like it was always supposed to it's supposed. Yeah. Oh, okay. The hills mean it's like nevada. It's like thousands of feet higher but just flat on top.

02:46

Yeah, hung olives very, um, very large flat plants. I have been worth doing cartography like non-stop the last three days and staring at how they drew the rivers and mountains. On this map is physically painful for me. Yeah, the new one or the old one. This one right now in the foundry.

03:09

Okay, like it hurts me so much to look at their map if you'd look at the map of l350 that i just posted last night. It is, it is one of the older maps but it gets the point across this. Yes, it does. So,

03:31

Preparing the forest and the new map to this map. It does look like a, they basically, they, they kept in mind, the pretty much exact setup of the force, the spirits? Oh yeah, i don't doubt that piezo. Now, that they're finally hiring good map artists to make maps hired.

03:53

Good people. I was expecting for them to hire talented people. I wasn't part of me, wasn't expecting them to like care about what the old stuff said or was depicted. As i thought, like it would be like we don't need to look at the old stuff, we could just make our make anything new.

04:11

Don't have to respect continuity at all. Oh man. I if there anything like me when i'm doing stuff, i measure it to the square when i'm remaking maps. Yeah. There's there's a really good example that i can't remember which ap paire it is right now but there was definitely it's either an AP or a um, or one of the community modules and it's like no no.

04:43

I just this is an updated version of that map. It's the same map. It just looks nice. And now please think because why would we have you go anywhere else? It makes way more sense for you to just be here at the thing to do the thing, which is what they do with the with the AP.

04:59

And it's just like, oh here we go. Why wouldn't you make it though? Um, i think we're doing new, it's making you cast. I i think we're doing new macbook cast i as well. So, that's good.

05:18

To cover all my bases. Did i miss anything in the recap? There was a lot of the shrine stuff like i kind of missed. I mean, y'all were telling i was that the comment have a job for us and the apparently we were supposed to know about that. Yeah.

05:32

Something about the temple that the only of the four storms were sealed away and before they broke out. So we have to go there and do something the calm you want us to go to the house of withered blossoms. And we were supposed to know about that. Yeah. We were supposed to know that miara took the assumption that.

05:52

Yeah, you're the destined ones. You clearly should know about this. Oh you don't know about this. Maybe you want ready for this? Maybe you're not good enough at least. That's what no way. That's what knowing heard because those words, never lips. That's definitely want to know it, huh? It's not like me or okay, my notes.

06:15

Okay. I was not paying her massive attention beyond being incredibly amused by uh by shenanigans last session. I do apologize. Um but yeah that that seemed to be the big takeaway is that the kami do actually have something in mind. The coming that we helped the way marker with said that they were going to go and talk to someone else.

06:35

I think i seem to have that here on my notes. Yes. But that is the bunk bed. Yeah, a lot of it was just spiritual shenanigans. Um, and that's all my notes on.

06:53

We just accidentally moved the map. It looks like.

07:01

No, i switched into a hex. Oh, that's what happened, because our little path in our border line is not on the the coast anymore.

07:16

This is usually fucked up. Um, also uh, not related to the recap specifically but ochi and sands happy one year. Yay. That's right. Yeah, i wouldn't check my my notes on technically. It is tomorrow. But did you save the top of a piece of the wedding cake in the freezer like you're supposed to?

07:44

Oh man, when i got married we decided not to do that because it's gross. I mean that's fight i always thought that was a stupid hollywood thing. Was that a real tradition did people? I don't know if it's real, i don't know if it's real. No, it's totally wrong.

08:02

What a waste of perfectly good cake to be fun though. The top tier of a wedding cake. Traditionally would be a steeped sponge so that thing is full of so much alcohol. It could stay for yous. That is fair. It's supposed to be like a, like i was fucking christmas cakes.

08:21

That come with you mean real fruitcake. Yeah, the fact that sands knows what you're talking about. Says, maybe about a line here, but this sounds like this sounds non-american. I've i've never had a soak. It is very non-American. We're taking america is an absolute, fucking travisy. Yeah, i've never had a soap cake, unless it was like a lava cake.

08:47

So bitch, i know i've seen it on like three british baking show where they like infused with alcohol and stuff. I've never had like a, that's soaked cake before. I mean, i like prepaid. Think i like no, i don't, i like americans. Oh bitch. Wow. I feel like i need to amend that statement.

09:11

Now that i've said it out loud, but you know what i mean. Now, i kid, i love you both. Everyone's got their own taste. I don't really care for american for cake because they just make it with most of the time dried fruit. Not even candy fruit. Never had it.

09:29

But back in the spirit of it, it is super sick that we made it a year. I didn't i it feels like it's been longer than a year already somehow working on the dude. You had a baby?

09:43

Yeah, that's very true. Like i feel like i know more about everyone's lives in this game. Jeff Grayson, you don't talk about yourself much. Nope, like i just learned you had a wife. Oh yeah, um camera. She was thinking about joining the campaign quite a while ago. But oh, that's right.

10:08

I remember her school stuff, got really busy. It's also probably easier for us to remember stuff that happens. And like, i only play in the one game. Lots of you, sans has multiple games they're running and it other people played multiple games quite well with keeping up on everyone.

10:25

Not only that you do really well in keeping in games together, because out of the, uh, um, four games i have ever started with you three are still going, like, nearly a year later. Well, ayon Susan has a bit of year but the other two had been more than a year approaching.

10:44

That's the regularity of it, the regularity and a time spot that works. You got to come every week. It's like the gym. If you get in the habit of not going than it falls apart, it's true. And you all were also very patient while i was fucking sick and going through a really rough patch too.

11:01

So, this game was always here for me when i needed a booster. Yeah, i look forward to this game, like, every single week, even the times that i'm not feeling it. I'm still stoop to just like do this, but anyways, so until it, my king maker game magnets. There is one player of the original five left in that game and it's been three sessions has it.

11:32

Wow, but you, those guys have been in that think that just that sorry. I'm actually like thrown by that. Wow. Has it only been. It may have been forced sessions. It hasn't been a lot though, even. So like but we've lost a player like a session and had them immediately replaced.

11:59

Wow, like the king maker game, has had a revolving door every session of at least one player changing. Okay. So i like to clarify. I said you're good at keeping games going. Not necessarily players can't see the problem. The problem. The problem is that, like me and you bought it laugh, that's the thing.

12:21

That's what it is. Like that's that's the thing we need. We clearly just need like the entire jade region party to just appear and fucking revoid and be like hey the fun part. Is that the one player that's remained is the one who's playing. Who was chosen? The in the first like session to be their barren, but no one's left.

12:43

That remembers that that's quite funny or something. Poetic about that a little bit. I'm gonna have fun with it. I'm gonna remind them like none of those people are still here. You're gonna probably want to re-talk to your new party anyways.

13:08

You know, the sec.

13:14

Uh, i think that was pretty much everything.

13:32

I think the only seen that happened that oh she didn't talk about was uh, miaro spilling her backstory to Ashoka and blow. Did you do the tuna egg finished doing that? God damn it. No way. Open the trees. Just like um, write your fan fiction elsewhere. No way. Crime world temporary.

14:00

Fix you feel better? If god damn it i was trying not to say try not to say to overcome my mockery with a single word. Now, i know that i've lost everything.

14:22

Oh, you know what's called that? Because that's the sound foxes make, right? They make multiple spot sounds. If there's anything that i learned from, like, I thank you because fox has learned to mimic other sounds. I live in the yorker dels guys, i don't need to be told the sound.

14:44

No fox snakes, listening. I rolled on your random encounter and it was 11 shadows and i'm not doing that to you. Oh my god. That's just game over for me. Like they would just eat choko and koya immediately in the game would end. Now, hey hey. I shouldn't really find a way to get around.

15:10

This. Is there an item that i could get? That's just your character is immune to x ability drain. Uh you could die and get raised as a spirit. That's an option. I don't recommend it. Um it's a fact, an option here. I i don't recommend that somehow though. Uh, i think practically speaking, you're looking for a wonderful little thing called deathward.

15:35

Um, generally if that one works away that, i think it does, it's been a while since i read it. Uh, pretty sure it makes you immune to to negative energy. Shenanigans doesn't palette, didn't give you amenities stuff like that. Oh, the subject is immune to energy drain. And any negative energy effects pada now, how do i get that army from negative energy effects?

16:09

That's an important. Distinction, not all the things that cause ability damage are negative. Energy shadows are, definitely will still rock your world. But, you know, feel like there should be like, some sort of like item that is like, attuned to each of the six abilities stores and like, uh, just protects against that ability.

16:31

Score in particular getting damage, just know you slide and sands it x amount of real life dollars. Bit create that item for you, not that you have a way to get it right now. Um, but well like i said this, i said that's Grayson is an incredible Taylor. That's how i got my sword.

16:55

If you get killed by a shadow's ability during you immediately get raised as a shadow, right? I think that's greater shadow. So, the distinction doesn't mean is that one of those effects that's like? Uh, this can only be reversed by like wish and shit you have to destroy. So if you'll raise doesn't undead in pathfinder, you like whatever you want.

17:20

Now has to be destroyed and then you are. You qualify for resurrection magic. Um, if you get hit by a death effect, uh, the death effects needs to like, you need to. So let's say you get killed by finger with that or something or destruction. Uh, the person who is trying to resurrect your needs to overcome a castor level, check in order to be able to bring you that

17:48

If you get hit by somebody doing a death attack, another bitch shoko. Is he getting lightning? Fuck. Being hit by anything. Oh my god, the lightning is back. Not anymore. Now i can kill it. I was about it. Your concert is pissed off the tango. God again.

18:15

My wet now. How did i piss off? Hey fang. How do how does that even happen?

18:25

You heard me. Um actually i assume it's very easy to do. So he's quite capricious as god's go. If i get 66 thousand gold on me, i could get a greater ring of inner fortitude.

18:50

Are you consider just not being fucking weak? That's probably work better. I will not min max like as hard as i have to show go on ability scores. Well, i didn't really intend for it to be like this. It just, i was like, i don't need strength and it only later i realized, oh, it's an A have a minus two to strength.

19:12

Oh, i i i live and die on the premise if i'm dmning and someone decides to track their score i'm like, i'm not even going to have to do anything. That's gonna be a problem for you later fan. It almost was him and koi. Have both almost died because they both have shank the five but koi is six seven-year-old woman.

19:30

So blessed by doesn't mean on myself if you want. Yes, why is she cheating?

19:43

I don't know how to verbally quantify the dead pan stare that i'm giving my computer.

19:53

So, it has been about a week since you guys entered the forest of spirits, you have had harrowing encounter after harrowing encounter sometimes strange encounters.

20:10

This is the entire forest. That's not. Yes, it is called the forest of spirits for a reason miro just stares at you.

20:28

Any settlements in this forest, there are some small villages but there are no cities like you would consider them. Will we be stopping by any of these settlements on our way through you. Wish to go to a town, not particularly just wondering if it's on the way. No. Oh uh i just does she speak the same common that Grayson does?

21:01

She speaks Talban comment as well as tien coming, okay.

21:12

But she does seem to have terrible understanding. All of you sometimes but that might have lessages with language more to do with how her brain works.

21:33

There's both abby and no way. Yawn excessively, uh, honestly

21:42

If i was worth a dumb, i'd probably say that going to a settlement is the fastest way to catch the attention of anybody who would dare bother to scout in the forests though and our experiences, i think that would be about it.

22:00

We do have a terrible pension for making bad things happen in. Nervousness the coming. Do not come here.

22:12

Do the regents men ever make for a forever. Make strike out into the forest. Yes, and then the forest kills them. Oh, that's that's close. Now, it's not simple. Drink for the dog. We are being granted passage because i am with you.

22:46

Box and your beloved comics into wants us to do something. But the konami do not command everything. In the forest, you must still be prepared for battle, indeed or you will battle. I will run. I mean you you don't have to

23:17

Run.

23:24

Well, if you want us to get through the forest in one piece and extra helping hand, when things get tough, could you make the difference between life and death? You are saying you wish for my help.

23:48

We would be honored if you would and i would be honored to fight beside you ears. Kind of like perk up like, she's thinking,

24:05

I have never fought beside others before.

24:11

You get like no reaction from nowhere but she, she's got like bloodshot eyes and his incredibly tired and it's just so done with your shit.

24:27

Do you fight like coming?

24:32

You know, i don't know how to answer that. I've never seen a call me fight.

24:41

Then you don't fight like fuckami, she does. I've seen her big garden.

24:55

Look at me all rip their opponents into bloody shreds. No, that is brutality, not fighting.

25:12

Just tell us how you really feel. Okay.

25:18

Just no. No keep going. I'm curious to see where this threat chop is off to. What's the distinction? Unnecessary levels of violence.

25:38

Uh, a necessary. The fuck was that, man?

25:47

You think more violence than it's necessary to accomplish your task and or taking the light in the violence?

25:59

Either shy guys. Color immediately shoots her mouth. Zips, her lips and says nothing to that. Just looking. But stately more like kelda looks up from her breakfast. What don't worry about it because

26:23

You might want to take my swords off me tonight.

26:35

So what else can we expect to find in here that we have an already found?

26:46

The number of spirits as many.

26:53

Would you say there's a particularly nasty spirit that we should really watch out for one that do you run away from every time? You see it miko.

27:10

Soco cox said, uh, shrine maiden Mmm, no. Miko.

27:23

Uh, like heard like her but minus the ah,

27:29

Oh, mako.

27:34

Oh, she's an arsonist. Not her, the one without the, ah,

27:44

Well, hopefully, we do not run into this make. Oh, i say yes, i jinx the entire party. Oh you will she still wants to burn down the forest, the spirits. So, she always shows to find someone to help her.

28:03

You can count your fire. So can you he would likely try to take one of them?

28:16

As in possess them.

28:22

Yes, that is what the spirits do. How do you look at you? Like you're a little slow again. Like how do you stop that from being possessed? Yes, i assume that you you've seen. I've i've assume that you have a waitress to protect against it considering you live here?

28:44

Yes.

28:49

And that would be magic. Oh, okay, protection magical, protect you from being possessed by an evil spirit.

29:08

Well, hopefully we can, uh, it's protected for me, is there a way you can make all of us protected at once?

29:29

Uh, for a longer period of time.

29:36

Not so much. I could protect us for 10 minutes or so at a time,

29:45

Um,

29:54

I guess so, that's i guess what to deal with that. I'm trying to find a way to like, suggest clerics spells. So, let's consider i play soccer so much, but i realize that shoko wouldn't have any knowledge of any of them. No, no, you're, you're fine. But you're the protection spells.

30:09

All last for a minute per level. You're a weak into a three-month journey across the spirit. Oh yeah, that's fair. We're gross. It's a temporary fix to a rob a substantial child problem.

30:30

Minute per month, it's 10 minutes but even then that's that's not going to help you more to the points. I suppose it was a bigger good thing, but both of our leading ladies here are perfectly fine with their willpower, right?

30:51

Yeah. I can't, i can't imagine any any pug spirit bossing coya around in her own body. Quickly as we'll save a plus 14. And if anything does try to cause trouble, i do still have this and choco taps, the nine-fold spirit sword on his side. Oh shit. I'm gonna go.

31:19

Also the 14. Yeah, because she gets her christmas or saved still. Yeah, must be nice. Having a willpower must be, it's a good thing. None of no one else in this party knows how to make fire.

31:43

None of you know how to make a fire. Oh no shoko could just do this. This is probably how we've been starting the fire every night. I mean, bruce and wine or something because otherwise i'm gonna fucking kill that.

32:04

Specify just get just like, you know, drops her swords and his like i'm gonna go do something because otherwise i'm gonna fucking strangle that i'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. I'll see you guys a while. I guess, maybe it's maybe it's the temporary day or that doesn't agree with her.

32:32

She has lived her whole life up in the cold. The most part. Wait, no, she came from magma. Never mind. No love you. You were right? So she did spend a lot of time in my car climbing the iris fan.

32:53

Oops, i did not mean deposit my apologies.

33:02

I'm still losing my fight with this fucking color.

33:08

Um, maybe i should uh immigration ask around and see if there's any trouble in the woods for a few miles.

33:20

Are you gonna summon birds? Chucko is going to ask a if there are any, if there's any trouble or weird newcomers to the forest, oh, there's these people who just rolled up in this caravan, there was a tiger. Um, there was a weird spirit guy and then there was that lady who taught a mako, how to speak more fluently and, like to sing and stuff.

33:51

I mean, that's the only thing that i've seen so far. Choko, throws a rocket here. And then another little sunbird lands on your shoulder but also it's not really a problem for us but it's probably going to be a problem for you. I suppose there's that dragon sneaking up on your camp.

34:15

No way, no way. Very high pitched dragon. Dirgan. And then you hear a roar. Oh fuck. You what was that about 11 shadows? Is that still an option?

34:44

What timing do we like? Do we stop the surprise around, maybe? You do they just come charging into view? Oh, okay, that's not a very big dragon at least.

35:06

Loaded sentences. 101. Here's where you tell me that tn dragons are just naturally smaller and this is the equivalent of like an adult. This is a young dragon actually uh because imperial dragons on the whole tend to be more dangerous. Yeah.

35:34

Roll initiative because he did actually shout for now and just not even let her pipe yet. It's like fucking what? Canonically? No way. Dropped her swords on the ground. Yes. And walked away from them. Oh, shit, she did. She is currently armed with like uh what they call them a tender stick attended wig for pipe.

36:07

That's that's what she has. She turns her head around the corner, and then just a very long litany of like erotaki. Swear words, just immediately like and all of your other friends are fighting a horde of lizard men like cobalts that have come into attack room, all sides, most sides.

36:47

My horry actually needs to roll initiative.

36:53

And yes, it's surprised around was just moving up on you.

37:04

It's very appropriate for me to be lost. I like this. It is kind of appropriate, isn't it? Um, and we're gonna play the feast of the dragon.

37:21

Yeah.

37:27

Oh gee, it's gonna draw his swords and rush up on it.

37:35

Can we get some skill checks to identify it? That's knowledge Arcana, right? It is knowledge iconic. Okay, before i move, i will roll my arcana. Um, that is enough to identify it as a forest dragon who are oftentimes, vicious and malicious.

38:06

Oh she says it's a big lizard, technically a forest dragon, but it's a basically the same thing. So then he warm draws swords and roll up on it. Oh, i say that in tn in front of the dragon. Oh no. That's probably pissed him off.

38:26

Boom. Boom. Oh gee. You, you definitely need to make acrobatics Spring attack. Ah, there you and then the college. Yes.

38:49

Is it evil very much so?

38:56

You know what? I'm also going to challenge it before i hit this button.

39:04

I'll take you on. He's gonna challenge.

39:11

Care a little extra dermage.

39:17

Oh, and then i get to possibly use a button. Do i confirm? All right. You do confirm sick? I just made this. Hold on one second. Where is it?

39:36

Ah, thundering. 10 damage.

39:45

Oh, i'm sorry, 1d. I had it as 2d6. So where's the d8? Is this a d8? Yeah, so three. Not that. Do you have the swift action to activate it? It's in the immediate action. No. I challenged? You think you're right? Dang it. That feels like it should be immediate though.

40:11

Twice per day is a swift action. Yeah. So i can't actually do that. Let me go change the thingy to have charges again. That feels like it should be immediately. That's, that's a really cool thing.

40:27

Sorry. Not no, you're fine. I was just happy to use the button because i just went through and added like my chinkaso, the fortunate soldier, my tunic. And i'm still letting it go through. Yeah. Okay. I'll talk, can we can we call it immediate then? And i won't have the swift next turn.

40:42

Just this one's since i'm doing two swift actions. Yeah, we're calling it an immediate. This certain cool, cool. So, it is the three plus everything that just happened there.

40:59

So ochi with zero, hesitation meets, this young forest, dragons, charge, and clash with a thunderous slash and blast that was a sentence. I just spoke hell. Yeah. Crash slash bash through the model, anything else? Where you ochi uh no that's it. Hit the intern great soon.

41:35

It skips mary uh grace and may still be afk. He put in chapter. Yeah, buyers at dragons. Still on phone. Boom. Driving bed. It's nice about to kill the dragon afk. The crate does not confirm, are you sure because he has a plus two to damage and attack rolls was i able to hit that?

42:00

I'm sure with it being 10 feet in the air. No, it was charged. You gotta do it needed to come down a little bit. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Now i'm back. Okay. Quite all right. You riddled this dragon with arrows.

42:25

Oh good. Luckily, some good attack rolls this time? Yeah. Streak of bad luck on the text for a couple sessions now. Yeah. But that isn't my favorite basically, right? Yeah, yeah. Very awesome. Uh, this dragon looks rightly fucked up now, actually, and looks like it immediately regrets its decision to engage the in battle for the about.

42:53

We're not a simple colossed, caravan.

43:00

You guys are gonna murder this thing and, no, it's just gonna turn the corner. Like what the fuck? Still lighting her pipe. She just lights her. Pipe takes a big long drag. Here's all this shit and then turns around and there's a dead dragon and there's a dead dragon Mary looks at Shoko.

43:17

This is where you wish for help. I think we have this one handled honestly.

43:37

Close the store. So i missed. Okay. The script just uh, attacked us while we were camped. Yes. Okay. Uh, everyone gets inspire courage, uh,

44:11

Feel all knives.

44:25

Look back.

44:30

And how many of us can i do? Good hope.

44:35

It's gray. Some within Grayson is out of range of ochi. So it's just going to be uh stroke. Oh, shillelu on the cocoa and Grayson all gets good. Hope, sans did you account there? Did you account for the challenge? Damage on that swing.

45:02

Not added into the total. It's in the effect notes, that's why i'm asking. 15 accident.

45:17

You do. I am now, okay? Just making sure.

45:26

And sugar will end his turn. Everybody got good help. Uh, not you. Unfortunately, you're too far away. Let's see how it is.

45:45

That pesky 30 feet. Oh restriction.

45:59

Uh, yeah, i haven't really thought about that. So, i took a five foot step back. I know from it's not 30 feet from me to you. Uh, drizzling. It's and then side steps. Throws her star knife, and drops the tracking.

46:25

Not even gonna just

46:31

Well done. Just like well done. Queer. Choose stabbed the cobalt through the eye with an arrow and pinned it to the ground. Never mind. Your butterfly dragon slayer now, i think you get like a membership card for that or something.

47:01

Didn't have. Oh she had a reminded me of the 16 damage. He did.

47:14

Oh, it's challenge multiplied because it's static, right? Whoa, it's an untyped bonus. That was a beefy hit, then that was what 59 62 67 damage, turn on it, and it just

47:36

To be fair. I knew what i was doing when i threw an evil dragon at you guys. Yeah, it gave me it gave me a good sense of where you are currently at power. Level wise. I feel like we could have taken an adult.

47:54

Oh, she takes his finger and sticks it through the screen up to magnus's mouth and goes

48:13

I'm gonna go take a nap.

48:18

Who feels like roast dragon for dinner. That is quite the delicacy. I would love to try that. Grayson, you like to take parts from these sorts. We're not eating a sentient creature. Oh, oh, she is and says how dairy suggests such a thing. I mean it was gonna eat us dragons.

48:45

Think of us as less intelligent beings, particularly evil ones. Who is saying this by the way. Oh yeah. Okay.

48:56

Check out shruggs. Uh all right. Don't do it. Uh, oh, g wipes, a sword and puts it away and walks up decoy. And it's like, oh i would love to have this. This philosophical conversation with you. Is there any problems if i harvest some parts? I don't think so Grayson so i'm not going to like, but you do it.

49:20

I never have, but i won't fit. And watch everyone here. Eat something like a dragon.

49:40

They're not used more violent than is necessary. They see, it's just desecrate the fucking courts. Instead they say did everybody else just one shot? A bunch of cobles. So cool. Looks at fucking no way like you aren't gonna judge me. Really miaro actually looks utterly disgusted by what's happening and runs off into the woods.

50:12

No, it takes a very like a longer from her pipe and it's like i wasn't talking about you.

50:25

Besides i don't see why my opinion should matter of that. All right we're transitioning to slice of life anime here. Showco, you should go after her, you know, he's right here, just the phone off into the forest, who knows what dangerous might befall her. Maybe another dragon that you can find your way through its chest with Oh my god.

50:51

No, a fucking hates. Me are both my. Why she actually doesn't she meara is just in a very like unfortunate position. Grayson stops. Getting the dragon and truckers going up, march off, and try and find me. All right, ashoko gets kind of out of range of the campus. So she's like what she said, i could and he points that uh koya that we are guests here, Grayson.

51:28

Perhaps we shouldn't. I will tell you what to do but i think it is slightly disrespectful.

51:37

Sorry i turned my head for six minutes so we having a domestic because that what's happening this is ochi grace and stuff again. Uh, tell his oldest she hides in a bush. All right. Do i need to take my bird right away? It's been 12 seconds. Miro. I'm sorry.

52:04

We just came out of the crown of the world and it was part of there. We had to make use of everything, we had to really scraped by to survive. And it's hard to kick that mindset. I forgot that we were guests here and we need to act like it.

52:26

Also, several dragons tried to kill us.

52:35

Checking for it is the same one. But that is for true, kind of pokes her head out of the bush Grayson's. Not gonna desecrate the course. We're going to, well, what should we do with it? I'm gonna let it returns at the land, where it belongs. Anuchi's busy praying over it.

53:02

Back at camp. All right. Shell goes going to return to camp and uh, chilco.

53:17

Neuro. Look behind you. Shell cocoon, uh, circle looks behind him. There's the red spirit of a woman behind you. That seems to be on fire. You know, fucking damn it burn, burn burn.

53:45

A little bit of save for me.

54:04

I don't suppose this counts as a necromantic effect. It doesn't surprisingly enough. All right, and i actually need my animated assets turned on. Son of a bitch.

54:24

It's a game that's going to refresh.

54:31

That's okay, because my girlfriend got back. And now i have a delicious sandwich. Yay. Who doesn't like a delicious sandwich?

54:47

So do you want to hop in like a private room? And like plot how shout goes going to kill everyone. Oh no. So,

55:02

The the initial thing, the ongoing effect is you gain. Pyromania, you gain the urge to burn things.

55:19

Now, is it an urge or is it like an overwhelming need? It's definitely an overwhelming urge, uh, and well, so possessed the DC of all your implications spells cast will be increased by plus one.

55:40

Okay, for one, look forward to all the sick burns. That show is going to lay down on all of us. Not that kind of burn. Oh, they end up comedian. Spirit would be pretty awesome. I'm just a matter of spirit, jimmy car appearing. I don't need that in my fucking research, okay?

56:04

Implication spells. I think i thundering drums is an evocation, i believe.

56:28

Yes, it is. It is unfortunately sonic though. So i don't think it pleases the spirit. Uh it doesn't, but that's not the point. You have sparked. You can let's fight things on fire. Yes, i can circle. Admires the pristine wall of the tents beside him and then just snaps his finger and lights it on fire.

56:54

It's like, oh, that's more fun than i thought. It would be. So everyone can roll perception.

57:08

As the after the world finishes loading.

57:17

Oh, it is only a fine object that i can light on fire. So like i have okay. Thing is wagons have a lot of things on them. You can sit on the fire. Yeah.

57:35

Dragons. We're adding we're adding forest dragons to the list already. Is that is how much sugar, that's all what we're doing now.

57:51

They're getting to understand that woman that i think it's an i said wanted to burn it down.

58:01

Uh, should i is everyone back in already? I am not. All right, which means i probably stalled. Refresh.

58:21

No. I mean while trying to figure out how to like blow images and smoke, she's got like a circles down. So, i look up a pyromania like it's an insanity, isn't it? Is it under? I don't think so. It is classified as a mania, which is something and it is.

58:46

But a reminder that this book was written before the madness rules were codified. Oh yeah, it's more of more, a matter of you, like something on fire. So, that your party will notice you become possessed by the pyromaniac arsonist spirit,

59:05

And can exercise you it's like oh that's fun and then immediately sets to like the next tense and then the next one and then the next one.

59:19

Yeah, we're we're gonna assume Grayson spots you at least after the first round it's been 12 seconds and grayson has already like detected. The difference between noise, nicotine smoke, and you're setting actual things on fire smoke and the campfire smoke. Well, he probably notices reception is very high. He probably notices the components of spark that, too.

59:50

That makes no sense. Oh wait. No, he wouldn't. Because i i have cutting caster. I do technically have shoko in line of sight as well. Thank you very much. Could have seen it. Why am i taking so long to live in though? Why am i yeah, i'm here. Uh well i mean both of you are listed as in the game.

01:00:12

Struggle isn't dumb. He knows the grace and can see. Well, he knows that, uh, uh, that, uh, cunning caster can hide the vocal component of spark. So why wouldn't he like, try and hide it? I just need to get into the setting to start rolling. Block track to explain that.

01:00:35

I would have to go into the fact that cereal arsenous like actual pyromaniacs enjoy watching their work burn like they will literally stare at it. Transfix is literally a, like a transfixing mania need to do something uh, also, they tender one other people to watch them work, or see their work and witness it.

01:01:01

I'm trying. I'm trying to make your your threat more threatening sense. I'm trying to the spirits themselves are not supposed to be. Major threats isn't miaro next to shoko as well. Oh yes, things things will happen as soon as i get back into the world. Yeah. Take your time sandwich is really good.

01:01:47

Okay, just marked you as off. Like oh no. You're back in the game.

01:01:56

Okay. Well, we're waiting. Does anybody listen to metal?

01:02:04

As such depends on what we're talking about. Like metal course, cardiacurate. I went and saw Norma Jean and gray haven and stuff last night here in. Um, i've never got to see him. I mean, was super, super sick. They were really good.

01:02:29

I've never been to a concert, it's pretty fun. If you like music in the dead air, i was going to talk about either that or bluey which is what we watch with the baby. It's a really good show or b and puppy cat on netflix. I feel like you guys might enjoy that show very much.

01:02:52

I've been greatly enjoying it.

01:03:03

Man, of course, just does not like me. A video of you guys heard of it. Be in puppy cat. I've heard the name. Uh i've never actually like watch it. Is that another um another show by a? I forget his name. The the adventure time guy it's in that vein i don't actually know, um, but it's really good.

01:03:32

Why the fuck is warp gate on again?

01:03:39

I don't use your game. If it's music gear, it's here. Now, millions of musical internally ego. Raptors, not what i was expecting to say, hand in cast.

01:04:05

Miles from 2013. And that long i didn't know that, but it's really good.

01:04:42

What a very strange random encounter generator this is i mean that was technically correct which part was the random encounter the dragon or the witch for the pymaniac i'm assuming she's in which which it just i didn't think you used that word at some point. Hi roman. She's an arsonist.

01:05:20

Oh, it's because i'm looking at the fucking iconic witch right now, that i said that, because i'm looking to loading screen for jade region that will do it.

01:05:37

What the hell is wrong?

01:05:56

Okay, so we're just gonna take our break a little early. Uh, well, i wait for this world data to go through. Yeah, nothing of something. I've always wondered about. Uh, the iconics is like, you know, how when referencing you, you know how, like a certain set of iconics is usually like used in the art of a particular adventure path.

01:06:24

Um, why is it that when referencing the events of another ap? They are always like a group of adventures, like the iconics are canon characters in the setting. Why isn't it just cannon that the iconics are the ones that escorted omega2? Uh, i mean kai because it's like they don't want uh the iconics to be canonized in that fashion.

01:06:53

Yes. They exist in the setting. Yes, i have their own stories and yes, they do. Hypothetically participate in a variety of APs, but the reality is like, the pies are writers. Actually want you to use your characters. So they like story wise don't have like an 18th level amari and i was wondering about that sheets and stuff that they can give you for the iconics but that's not the point.

01:07:23

Actually argument is a little bit more. I'm invalent. Now that second edition has canonical endings. That can be in stock contract to whatever you did in your adventure. Yeah, i guess that is the main thing. Like, now that we have to actually reckon with the timeline moving forward and revisiting settings, after adventures have already done things in them, it might just make the the writing a bit easier.

01:08:01

If we just say that the the kingdom in the river kingdoms that was king maker is just just has a name now and like, it's the only or whoever is in charge. Like, i guess it really is. It's ambiguous enough so that you can, you know, an average down.

01:08:24

So they have to cater for two different people. On the one hand, you've got people that are already familiar with the stories and first edition and therefore have probably paid. It played the adventure path. So, done the society stuff or whatever, and they have an idea of what canonical timeline is or if it's their own table, they'll have their own canonical timeline of what makes sense.

01:08:41

And then there's the other party through their actually, having to market, you who don't have any of that and need to be reintroduced to the concepts. Yeah. And they need to make it ambiguous enough so that they can't say, oh, it's specifically that adventure where that happened. If you want to know about that go and fucking read it.

01:08:59

They can't actually say that because, i mean, how can you tell people to go and buy the earlier, kind of a bit of a fall off in the business world. So they're like okay here's generally out there certain things have to be canonized just because they're big overwhelming pieces, that you have to acknowledge the big ones that immediately come to mind.

01:09:24

From first to second edition is one uh, empressutropia is on the front entaldo. And she is truly a benevolent ruler like that isn't guarantee, but it's

01:09:42

Uh, tbs back. Uh, yeah, well turbathon, yeah, that's that's the big one because they had to replace the demon apocalypse with a new apocalypse for the world to send crusades up. So that's the thing, which means you have to care about harassment, which means you have to care about Deb.

01:10:00

So, there's a thing there. There's the fact that queen delfry is canonically the Harold, the violent, right? Yeah. Um, there's we cannot send a letter complaining to james jacobs to make ray bright sword. The herald environadai? Yeah, which i wouldn't write on anyway. Frankly, i think the Queen Alfred, is the most sensible choice.

01:10:21

Like everything. I will say that her her characterization in the video game is incredibly bad. So, literally, all i've seen of the galfren, the video game is that little is of people saying that if you take the glitch, adventure, lynch, mythic path, you can raise her as like, you're undead for all.

01:10:41

Yep. She hates it. It's really funny. It's really, really funny. Um, she does some things that are very human, which i will agree with but our incredibly bad for like halogen queen who has been raining for a century. Um, i cannot with that plot point. I know why they put it in.

01:11:05

I know narratively why they put it in, but my interpretation of galfrea has always been that. She is basically the cloud cooker. Lander of Falladons because throughout all of the earlier content, the idea is that girlfriend's kept around because she's one of the few people with the authority to like, keep the crusade in check.

01:11:26

Um, not that she's doing excellent job, but she is doing a job, which is why people are paying for her to live longer. Uh, but also she's a little bit out there because she's one of the few people that also claims to have regular conversations with irony, like, huh, actual regular conversation.

01:11:46

So, most people think that she's fat shit crazy and she doesn't like flout this thing as like, oh, i've talked way up at 8:00 this week. It's just like a small thing that is known to her immediate advises. So oh she probably has the same thing that um ray has or you have that mythic connection with helmet and you can just ask her whatever.

01:12:05

Wouldn't surprise me. I mean, she's a 15th level pollen, so that was before her essential obviously, but before that. Yeah, it was. It was always whispered but she had regular conversations with. I am late as like a, basically a check-in and it's half. The reason why she hasn't gone fucking mat over a hundred years of rain.

01:12:22

So yeah, i don't know. I i'm very much at the opinion that everybody in like her immediate candre. Knows the galfre is a little bit cookie and a bit out there, but she puts up the vanilla being this incredibly stoic. And, you know, in charge large and in charge personality, that's not everybody's interpretation.

01:12:45

Obviously, they weren't the completely different one for the video game and i totally understand why they did that. But like i don't i don't really get it. I was like you're telling me that someone who has rained for this long and has been basically on the precipice of kind of going nuts is going to do this.

01:13:08

Incredibly arguably, borderline evil thing and not immediately. Get backhanded by the inheritor.

01:13:22

Big fan of any, any of the like, monarch of the upper intercity, even evenaldo out of being like, yeah, i can see that happening but not my girlfriend. It's why she can't become heralding video game. So of them, the fact that completely gutted the whole concept of whole thing anyway and video game.

01:13:46

But yeah, fuck is happening with say jams torso, on the cover of brine wall legacy. Like, i'm actually like looking at the art. It's surgeon's torso does weird things. In most all of his art, he's not kicking something in the face or grappling with like a fucking alligator. Something wrong is going on with isn't happen and welcome to 12 month.

01:14:36

Man looks like he has just like a giant ass tumor growing on the side of his abdomen. I think that's a perspective. Fuck up. Yeah.

01:14:51

I mean i get what they're doing because that muscle is when you think it does stretch like that. Like, the problem is that the rest of us tosso looks to be more head on. Yeah. So it, yeah, i see what they went for and uh reynolds did a little bit of fuckery without particular one.

01:15:14

But this is, this is one of his earlier works. So i don't a little criticize too hard. I well it's one of his well. It's one of his earlier works for pies though but i'm familiar with the guys and as a magic artist and he's been doing art for magic for way longer than this.

01:15:29

Oh, yeah, i'm familiar with him doing the dragon stuff before before, like, all the things, but i'm talking specifically, in relation, just who pies of stuff and trying to be. Nice lead certainly has a type the okay that which is like zero with the largest lady front parts i've ever seen in art.

01:15:49

Yeah, he he definitely has a tight but he does one thing that i fucking adore him full and it's the fact that when he gets out an adventura he gets out in adventure. They look like they're actually powering all. Yeah, i'm way into that. I was just like this lady.

01:16:04

She can't run. She's gonna knock herself unconscious. Where's my favorite piece of wine rentals magic art? I need to find it now because it's it's it's something else i just like a mako, like a makers aren't like. This is like a regularly proportioned like woman, right? Like obviously in the fantasy setting, they're going to make them all like, the, the ideal body type or whatever.

01:16:29

There's not going to be a lot of diversity, but the witch she couldn't, i don't think you could go adventury. You'd have to have like two sports bras to do anything. Well, she's a caster. She doesn't have to do much show. Oh, athletic stuff. You're telling me that armor is going to hinder.

01:16:49

You give you an arcane failure chance, but having breasts larger than your head isn't the hell? It's magic just fine. Hey problem occurred. It it's magic. I ain't got to explain shit. Foundry. Booted me. Oh yeah, one. Yeah.

01:17:17

All right. Dumb. Dumb RP question that. I now realize that no, i would ask. Amigo is your hair naturally that color or what? Like what is up with that? I think i've only just realized

01:17:39

Uh, no. This is one of my early adventures, i had a run-in with some goals.

01:17:54

But what?

01:18:00

It's not a bad luck for what it's worth. At least it got symmetrical, right?

01:18:09

Yeah, i might have had a priestess of Shailene. Touch it up a little. Well, they did. An excellent job. Behold the edgiest angel you will ever see. I don't know. I've seen i've seen arts of oh, oh, this is a close. Second made it animation. No. Turn off. Work.

01:18:42

I need work gate on. No. No, but yeah that's that's the quintessential reynolds piece when i think Wayne Reynolds. Like that's just all the angels, all the sharpie pointy bits. I i have to confess that i do think more now of it used to be the the age of worms big print that they did.

01:19:07

Um, with kios and the, you know, the great, the great purple worms and support the standing adventurers, kind of falling from the cliff edge and such. That's what i always used to think of. But over time, it's it's gone to like the, some of the iconic stuff from from pf because i do, i do really enjoy the fact that he designs characters but yes he has a type.

01:19:36

He's allowed to have one. It's fine, but they do look like they actually have their veteran gear on.

01:19:46

And i mean, like, uh, if that's a really big problem with you, drizzling if you have with his art. Um, they have clearly told him to reign it in for like the past five years or so. Yeah, no i would imagine i know this is like 2011. So this is pretty old stuff at this point.

01:20:09

They gave cioni a pants and i'm still upset. The cape is badass, right? He own his cape. I, i will fight people over that. I think it's a really cool design. Um but yeah, she definitely was was to use a trope name here, it was very nailed to. It was very what male is very much.

01:20:39

So she was, she was missed fan server for pathfinder and i mean, it kind of makes sense for a source rate is that the witch iconic, i don't know. There was one drawing of her where literally looked like she was holding her robes up with her butt cheeks. Is that the the witch iconic?

01:21:01

How do you spell her name? Yeah, let's see. E. Oh and honest s. E o n. I she's the vorizum tattooed sorcera. Yeah. She's she's the iconic sorcerer.

01:21:24

No. Um, if you if you don't want to see more exaggeration, i don't read the pathfinder comics with zion. Which i, i'm continually reminded that like she only always seems to be in the most chaotic situations and then i have to go back. And remember, no, no. She's lawful neutral and then i read the comics.

01:21:42

Um, and i was like, oh no, she hell. And also neutral parties about to go and do something very dumb. She's like now now cease. Yeah, if you image search for that, first result is her oneie depiction. The second episode is her to eat depiction. There are no pants here.

01:22:03

And the second result. Uh, okay, yeah, i forgot. Yeah, i know. It's just the cape. Cape is a cover. Super six. Yeah, but now largely pantsless no pants.

01:22:24

The actual, the actual, the one that i hate is what they did to a miri like a mirius, she's anorexic. Now i have no idea why they thought that was a good direction to take her. What was wrong with big? Bulky? Hot woman. Like what was wrong with that?

01:22:47

I don't know. She was way better that way. Yeah, it's one of those things where i respect that like Wayne's are as improved but this design is a downgrade.

01:23:00

Because she, she look quite quite sickly now and it's a typical to what she's supposed to be. You know, or berry though i guess if they wanted to portray more of how a general? Yeah. Handed might appear. Then if you've been out in the what in the wilderlands starved for like three years then yeah, you would look like that.

01:23:28

Now, i'm stuck loading. Is anybody else in? Uh, i got in but i i took your place. I'm sorry, i'm still loading, but wet. I'm connection to what the fuck is website connection.

01:23:54

Server shit. No, not again.

01:24:11

Don't screw us on the one-year anniversary. Country forge not foundry. This isn't foundry salt. This is gorgeous salt, which is, which i don't actually know. Like, what the difference between the two is foundry is the actual app itself. Forge are the servers that i host foundry games on. Okay, if i had a powerful enough server to run stuff, my games would be fucking mind-blowing.

01:24:41

Here's a comparison of the iconic barbarian from one e to two here. This is what we're talking. Yeah i was looking at it while you guys are talking about it. They definitely made her look a little more thorough and thin like i pirated king maker and played it for a little bit and honestly it was really hard.

01:25:00

So i gave up, um, my favorite thing about the king moose again, genuinely is the it gets the right feeling of like, wow, this is actually difficult. And then just proceeds to in the back end of the game, go off the fucking rails with difficulty, really? Oh yes. Yeah, i'm just i'm, i'm like really bad like, notably bad, it's strategy as you guys have seen but like, oh, she's like i run in and stab it.

01:25:31

Like that's, you know what i mean? Like, right. I want to see you supposed to do. I don't i don't ever like min max stuff. You know what i mean? I always like come in with a character concept and i force that character concept and i have like a backstory in my head and i try and make all of the flavors line up and play by the flavors and instead of like ever re-strategizing or like changing anything, i just try harder and so kingmaker was really difficult.

01:25:57

I got to like, okay, where you, you got set up for that ambush like, very early on and like a fucking somebody dropped like a hydra. And uh, like three big scary things on you and like the abandoned castle. And i could not even like invisibility get out of there and just gave up.

01:26:21

So, the problem with king maker is that it highlights. The biggest thing about like Pathfinder and virtual table tops as a whole, really not just Pathfinder, I've been talking dnd, you know, stars beyond measure, whichever version of the TTRPG system you want to use and it's it's too cold.

01:26:41

Like a dm would usually give you like a a show. You want to do that? The game mom? Yeah, no, no, it will not. It will not the detail might say like uh believe misses you when it actually create you the game. Well and it's another one of those like where like i've played previously in.

01:27:03

Like didn't understand the meta of the game like what skills are important and function for what? And like how often they come up and like, what a good DC or bad DC or good save or bad save is. And so, like i get to a point like that where i'm like, okay, like some invisibility potions might get me out of here and i try and save scum my way out.

01:27:24

And my character is like, solo level. It doesn't have, you know, he's not good enough. Anyone thing to get himself out of there? He's not strong enough to fight them and he's not stealthy enough to get away and i'm like, well, that just starts the whole game over and like, play a different class.

01:27:40

This isn't it? I was playing a conjuration with her. So, i just mentioned door out, it was really funny. There's no doubt in my mind that the king maker and the rock like owl cat, ah, x like clearly experienced first edition players, right? Yeah, yeah. And although they do a they've made a lot of changes to different archetypes and how so spell works not to make it with their system and like a bunch of other stuff like i get it but it's done.

01:28:16

Like the game doesn't do a very good job of teaching Pathfinder like it just doesn't. Yeah no. And like i said there's still a lot of gaps of my knowledge. So like the amount of scrolls that i was buying just to keep my party alive and ensured that i was very poor and not investing in like items to make my character stronger because i was trying to like level up a specific party and i just kept like losing someone and then having to go back and resurrect them and then do it again and losing somebody else.

01:28:47

Like, if you lose your healer, do you revert, do you know you just save scum your way through the whole game, which i hate doing. I hate doing that. I'm literally favorite part of my least favorite part. Playing king maker was the fact that, uh, like being the lead character, you're always going to be like putting situations where like you're in front of the party or you're like, you know, you're used up forward to talk.

01:29:14

And it's like, okay, a fight broke out, and now you decided to not play a frontliner and you're in front of everyone. So i guess you just died now. Conversely. There's also the problem of like you're wanting to play this kind of character, but you i i get that there they set up the thing of like if you're wanting to actually be functional in a conversation, please tell me that you invested in diplomacy or charisma or both preferably both.

01:29:45

Um, it's not as necessary, but for a lot of key interactions, it feels like it's necessary. Where there's practically a lot of the time is damn. I just be all like all right, if you can sell me on it i'm not even gonna make you roll a check. Yeah.

01:29:58

Um, you know, if you can role play it like photos, if you don't want to, that's also fine, totally cool. Uh, it's just going to be more like. I remember i don't want to run free of fucking. Uh, it was. Yeah, i think it was in the co-tour games, where one of the stats, you could raise on any of your units was a diplomacy and but it didn't do anything on anyone other than the main character.

01:30:25

It was just complete trap option on everyone else. That's that sounds correct. Cozor was fantastic. I miss couture you know i didn't the game get put on like a remake. Get put on the back button again. It got put on indefinite hiatus. Yeah, no, no, i heard that. Um, the the co-tour remake and co-tour three are coming out the same time as wins a winner.

01:30:56

That sounds accurate. Yeah, i recently talked to somebody who was like so i met George R, Martin in like 2014 and like i had a 10 minute conversation with him and my main takeaway from that when i walked away was that man is never finishing that book. Like he is the most detail oriented, uh, obsessive.

01:31:24

Like like every like everything needs to be, the fact all the fleshed out before you move on. There's no fat, it's all content. So having read a couple of of the uh, um, a song of ice and fire. I'm gonna disagree heavily for that. Uh, there's plenty of fat on here.

01:31:54

I'm not saying that it doesn't add to the flavor of what you're trying to do here, but i'm going to tell you that it's that um, you definitely think that you can write certain things in certain ways and use those idioms and that but they don't work. I think i do, um, but i can also appreciate that as like, it's not my taste.

01:32:13

Yeah, that's fine for sure. I remember finishing dance in the summer of late 2013 or 2014 after late season one came out and going to the ASO FIAF or whatever subreddits and having people like get so deep into it because of how like complex they thought george wasn't writing it.

01:32:42

That like the raven that mormont has the number of times, it would say corn was foreshadowing specific. Things like it was a code and they're like no no like you know red lines with the push pins on the map and that's infoil hat. Like i'll listen the number of times he says corn.

01:33:00

Okay. You know what i mean? Like some da Vinci code. Fucking vesuvian man or whatever it is. The truvian is that white people were doing that with the show. Yeah, people people love to do that kind of full shadowing thing and it's also a very good exponent. Like example of why i utterly believe the following statement which is if you write content.

01:33:22

Now it is. All right. Just doesn't really matter what you're writing content for. Don't read the fan section. Um, don't because it will ruin everything.

01:33:38

They're like so many writers have talked about how i i had one plot for my story and then i went online and i read a fan fiction and they guessed the plot and i was like, well fuck. Now what do i do? I i believe that you should reward people that have that much of an interest in your plot.

01:33:56

You know by going. Yeah. Congrats you you clocked it you. You know what i was putting down. Was right because i was fortunately, i hate when offers like figure that out and this is why i'm like leave me alone. Go into a dock box and write your shit and come out.

01:34:09

What you done with it. Like i i don't care. Just just do it. Um because they'll do that and then they feel and dm's have the same problem. Um in my experience, what they're doing their own content and the apply is like invested enough to actually sit down and be like oh i wonder what this is all about and they'll come up with theories about like oh this is actually this and stuff and saying hey damn, what do you think about this theory?

01:34:32

And realistically is damn, you should go interesting. Nice. Um, but in the last 30, you might be going shit and obviously ends change stuff because they feel like they need to surprise or, you know, kind of come out of the shadows or some sort of, you know, twist or something.

01:34:52

Oh, just wait. I think it's fixed reward your fucking players, uh, please be fixed. I would like to roll dice.

01:35:12

Login, organs successful.

01:35:20

I think i'm in. It's just uh blank screen though, pretty screen. But i do have all the ui elements.

01:35:48

Oh yeah. Amen. I have to start mine over because i was stuck.

01:36:16

By the way, shoko was never listening to ochi for romantic advice ever again. Like the one time i listened to you, i get possessed by a fucking ghost but the worst thing that could happen is she says no five minutes later. Everything is on fire. That's i don't think this is a fair example of taking my advice.

01:36:46

You know, when i said that that other continent was gonna start fucking shut up. This doesn't really what i meant. Um, to be fair though, the other time that we uh, who we took my advice, we walked straight into the ride runners guild to talk to Thor bork, silver score and try.

01:37:04

I literally, i turned to Shoko and i said, i'm sorry, i'm so so sorry, you were right. Which is such a delightful. Okay, i love him. I get a lot of drawing out of mochi. He has many things. But why this is not one of them? No, no. Oh, she is not wise.

01:37:31

Just phenomenal with the blade apparently because yeah, that was a really clean cut.

01:37:41

Not to downplay the porcupine aspect of this poor dragon that i'm currently looking up as the several arrows. Yep. That baby dragon did not know what was happening, and i am also in i'm in, but i'm looking at a gray screen. Nope, i don't know the screen. We just need to drag you over to the right map.

01:38:10

I believe.

01:38:14

Me, it seems. Hey guys, remember this one? Oh yeah, i do. Oh wow. No man. It was like, no, no. I don't likely no, this is broji and Grayson. Yeah, that's fuming. Foomy Kageutsu was still here. I was half extracting to say like two text to a to a like a tokens of characters.

01:38:44

We had never met before but you would left the two people who started the campaign over there. Still great screen. Oh no. No, i'm back. Everybody's in Grayson you with us. Yep. Yep. I'm at the care of it. Cool. All squinty eyed at shoko around the corner.

01:39:15

No, no no, no. No here because she saw you get possessed.

01:39:28

So she's trying to put a necklace on you. I've seen this episode of fireflies. She's trying to marry him. Wait, no. Sorry. That was like a flower crown but as she does that, she waves a fan in your face. Role willpower for me, please. Uh meanwhile grace is like, oh she what, what did you tell show?

01:39:59

Could it go do with her over there to talk to her? Why, what's going on? There's something like necklace thing. He's like clicking his fingers together. Weirdly, i don't know what's going on. Maybe he's gibbity boob opener.

01:40:22

Just just, like, you know, my earlier jokes about like, the the national geographic pathfinder edition for, like meeting practices of the kid's name. You know what can we just change topic? I don't, i don't want to know he's over there going. It's cool, baby. You don't sweat it shooku.

01:40:42

You are now under the effects of common motions. Oh, Well, i don't know what what he was saying, but it seemed to have worked there. Oh she uh man. You're pretty wise. That must have been good. Good suggestion to him. Once the necklace is safely around your neck. The evil spirit is expelled from your body and she shoes it away with the fan.

01:41:12

The tension. Fortunately is still on fire. We all know nothing about this. Stop the burning. Oh. Oh, uh, well, no, no, i'm calm. So i'm like, oh, oh, um everyone. The tent is on, no. She snaps her finger in your face and ends the spell stop. The burning magic man.

01:41:35

See their snapping at each other.

01:41:43

There isn't some mankind thing but i need to know about giving people jewelry is there fire? No, what This is incredible. You very much wishes you around the corner. Oh, i don't know what check it is. To put out fire.

01:42:08

Uh the caravan is alerted to the fire, only one wagon, sustains any damage. And you put the fire out through a rapid conjoined. Effort of several people. What the fuck? Chuckle. Hey. Hey, it wasn't me. It was all. I mean, it was maybe i mean koya, walks around the corner and casts, create water.

01:42:37

Um, hold on, what's up? And he goes shoko. Did you did you like koias tent on fire?

01:42:49

Well, i mean i did but it wasn't me. Okay. It was just told you to go after me. Ori what the hell? No, no listening to me. Who wants it? Was the mako, the mako. The amazing goes over there at the campfires. Super. What are you talking about? Shuttle, reach it over and closes ocean, you see, you see?

01:43:15

No, i just look at it. Look at it looking back. And it's just kind of like, She can't breathe. It was the spirits mako the pyromaniac? It possessed me and then i let go of you. Yes, he immediately ignored it, all of my mornings and followed me into the woods without protection.

01:43:46

Well, you're safe. So that's good, right? You walk like a child. I i am a child. Not you bird. Over fox. I think that's racist. Oh, she stops away back around the campfire.

01:44:16

Just like amigos. This is my final moment. All right, whether to be known but at least i was laughing at someone else and nothing shoko looks chuckle. Has been a band room for back up here. Just left. Actually just looks up. Oh, she goes off. It starts like brushing down his horse.

01:44:48

It like taking care of all this shit to call himself down. Oh my goodness. Okay.

01:44:59

I think i'm just going to take a nap right here. It's fine. It's all right. After that, i think i'm gonna just

01:45:11

Choco just collapses gets the side of the tent. What did i tell you? Slice of life anime. I need a drink. Did you like me and show? Go on here. I'll be right back.

01:45:33

That was beautiful.

01:45:38

I'm telling you that this forest sucks.

01:45:53

You know, a person says, no way, she kind of, like, believe inside way on the ground and starts going into into liquid. Free soft dose. No, there's not sleep. We might not be in mankai, given our track record, this is just the start of whatever it is, they want us to do here.

01:46:14

So, i buckled No, that was well like overthrow the government or something. Oh god. Yeah. Why did i come along on this caravan? Yeah the moment you say that actually no. I just immediately like softens up and just look at the maker and i was like, oh shit. We need to overthrow a government, right?

01:46:37

That was that's a thing. That's the thing i'm doing.

01:46:51

Did you immediately first back to disturbs at the stylish? You forget that or just never realize it, gonna be honest. Love. I thought i was gonna die. Well before this point, and i thought, either you'd kill me or the snows would kill me. So this would be on balance of probability.

01:47:08

I would, i kill you.

01:47:18

We did kill a lot of other ninja that were sent to kill you. Just pointing that out.

01:47:28

There. No way is a bit of a statistical. Anomaly isn't that right? Hot soup.

01:47:40

Yeah, okay. Does the thing where she's kind of paying more attention now. Uh technically i agree now noise the freak of nature.

01:47:58

I'm glad the tables have turned now that we've crossed the north pole. The saddest thing about that is she's not even gonna argue with you. Just kind of looks pretty sad slaves. Like yep. Yeah, that that is kind of a thing. So yes, consider me surprised to be here.

01:48:28

The admittedly, and i'm far more surprised, but you're having me this thing around and taken adjuster belt where the word Which, for the record i think, was

01:48:50

Was a all right, i'm back. You were gonna say noise.

01:49:01

Doesn't say anything. Should go stumbles back to the kit to the fire. Go back to laughing at the consumer.

01:49:22

Uh, meow returns about half an hour later.

01:49:32

Is not safe for you to wonder, but it is safe for me. Oh, g normally would have been like, oh, i'm glad you both came back but he's gonna make it a point to like just ignore both of the foxes for the rest of the night. She upends a bag in the middle of camp.

01:49:52

I'm good. You can keep gray from busy for the rest of the evening. I'll dragons collect things. Okay. So, let's not generalize. Okay, the dragons. That that's a fair point. I keep forgetting that whenever we kill a dragon.

01:50:20

That's,

01:50:25

Is some of the nature's ally on my list. No. Yeah, let's not make generalizations at all. I am an honorable tengo. No way is the only ninja. We've met to not kill. Try and kill a mako grace. It is a dwarf. Who is a monk? That's not true. What?

01:50:56

Which part is not true. Then she is the only ninja you have met that hasn't tried to kill the mako.

01:51:12

Statistically most of the ninja that we have made. Sure, saying this have tried to kill a maker. Miro statistics, as you guys are talking about this, like noise kind of hat. Like, she looks like she's half asleep, but you can see her frowned deepening with engineers, like, genuinely already, but please continue digging this hole so that i can figure out exactly how hard of the BTSD should be.

01:51:43

The point is show goes on it and he puts to the new together. Miaro are you will. Are you a shinobi? Yes, the point i was making was, let's not make generalizations but continue unless they mistaken, it is common amongst all dragons that they collect something. Whether it is knowledge treasure.

01:52:13

I heard once that some dragons collect friendship, that is the most sacrament thing i've ever heard in my life. Um, you haven't heard youtube talk for more than five minutes that one. Says no egg roll from going back to her now. So the call me trained. You in ninjutsu.

01:52:41

I didn't think, oh, i guess, i guess it makes sense. The coming chain both in the samurai ways and in the ways of the shinobi.

01:52:55

We do not see one technique as evil over the other simply different. It is mortals that apply such labels to things.

01:53:10

I suppose they do need a way to fight when they take physical form or they would die. Many of them still cannot though.

01:53:24

That is why it falls to shinobi like me and zouichian coming to protect them. Zoitian, common, can i make a skill? Check on that knowledge nature.

01:53:40

Let me it's planes.

01:53:49

Forecotta. Yeah, boom. Call me our outsiders in this edition, really? They are not just outsiders though. Oh yeah, they're very special things. It's a generalization of those problems. We go, boom. If it's planes. Let me know because i would like to roll. This one is planes completely actually. Yes.

01:54:20

Uh, ochie. You know, the zushan are really up there in the ranks of the commie, uh, but you know, little else specifically about them only that they're big movers and shakers. She'll go that their natural 20. Uh, are aware the tuition are master archers and katana masters. And every weapon they touch, becomes blessed.

01:54:53

With holy power, they can also fire arrows from their bows that deliver magic is powerful as the heel spell and restoration, and if the need arises, they can breathe life back into someone with one of their holy arrows. So you were trained by the solution in the way of the blade and i imagine the bow as well, no burro.

01:55:24

Um, not familiar with that name. Why would you be have you met him all? No, no i haven't. Are you going to introduce us?

01:55:39

That is what i am leaving you through the forest. Well, i hope he likes me. He won't. That's unfortunate. No bro. Doesn't like anyone though, so don't take it personally. I'm sure the other commie will like you. You have an energy about you, it is pleasing. Okay, disappears into the bushes.

01:56:11

I think. Let's go goes back to drinking.

01:56:21

Chicago goes back to drinking and occasionally glaring. It okay.

01:56:31

Goodness. The boom. It is.

01:56:43

Another two weeks of travel. All right, i'll hit the rest button before anything really crosses your paths again.

01:56:59

I do put this up every day, so i'm always down one spell slot.

01:57:10

Gonna ask. What's up with the floating bone near shoko's head, right? It's been doing that for a while, but given that we're in a place where the spirits are known to temper and interfere with oneself, that seems sacrilege. Well, yeah, but this is a bone from one of those.

01:57:27

Uh, uh, bras spirits that tried to kill us in the crown. Oh, this is an old table and good to know. Those are distinction says now. Well, i think i got it off of a mammoth, so

01:57:44

He's just always gone mammoth mastodon femur floating next to him. Yep. Oh wait, it has to be a femur. Okay. No, then it was a person. So maybe it is psych religious, but it does not labeled evil, which doesn't have to be a fever. It doesn't say that i just came up with that.

01:58:03

Uh uh ohchi which would i'm about to start working on another item for you would you which of the two things you wrote wing boots or necklace of keys. Trying, would you like first the boots? Okay, you know, actually speaking of menopause that raises a good question, but we have taken like, you know, i'm not gonna finish.

01:58:25

That's all. I think about it placed off, probably a very evil thing to say.

01:58:36

Uh, in those two week times, Grayson actually finishes three items.

01:58:45

Oh god. It's a great screen. Again, you know, i'm just gonna call you a sweatshop. Instead of a freak of nature given that i've apparently inherited that title, is everyone else? Looking at a gray screen right now. I'll move you as soon as the reload finishes. Yeah. Now, i'm looking at my loading bar.

01:59:08

Yeah, that's the thing in food and it's all out again. I think i've got my console up. The server hiccups will be. I don't see any other errors, though. During the reload so far, that's good. Just with starting on that map for some reason. Oh wow. That was a pretty good dragon horde.

01:59:35

Uh, just so, you know, Grayson is taking that potion of tongues and putting in his bag for a an emergency situation where he might need to speak their local language. All right. That was quick reload. Uh and then we also make sure we don't let Shoko take the scroll of fireball.

01:59:54

Yes. Just in case. Uh, however, uh, little RP thing is, uh, one. One morning and everybody's meeting up for breakfast grace and pulls out a item and gives a item to kalda. Uh, he is crafted her, a scabbard of vigor.

02:00:24

How many more marriage proposals? Are we gonna have to deal with in this forest when we go? She eyes the scabbard complete. That's is, that's a form of, i mean, i didn't realize you felt that way about her other. Grayson, this isn't just the same gavered from my family.

02:00:43

You made a new one? Well yeah. I you know you hey i know it's your weapon isn't uh magical and even though i can't enchant weapons and i thought this could at least help you out a little bit.

02:01:02

She kind of like hugs it a little bit. I love it. She bear hugs. Jason, probably picking him up a little bit too, because she's got about six four points of strengths in. You. Yeah, she would notice that the the outside of it is made with white dragon scales and like skin or leather.

02:01:28

Oh my god. Yeah, that's pretty much a fucking marriage proposal to her. No, i wasn't joking. She she starts stripping off her old scabbard and slides her sword into it but no uh yeah. I was going to say there's a lot of places that sentence was. There's a lot of places that sentence was going and a lot of places where i mean, we've got like how many characters like not even a little bit.

02:02:00

Romantically entangled right now. Grayson has a lot of options if so does. Oh, she a lot of option. Just one, i mean is other option would have been shillelu, but i feel like they're just best friends. Okay. She's she's his teacher, uh, in ways of archery and survival. Not uh not romantic and she is proud to watch you surpass her as an archer.

02:02:32

We're getting. Yeah, for reference, the other two items i finish. I upgraded my cloaker resistance to a plus two. And then finally finished upgrading my headband of inspired wisdom to a plus six.

02:02:52

God damn. That one took a long time to get through. I think i'm still using a plus two headband you guys have headbands.

02:03:15

Jokes aside though. Nice people. So old you, when are you going to get yourself a girlfriend? I am married to my duty. My friend shortcut just gives you the flattest look on this race. I think that was another marriage proposal to make of what? Wait, no no. That's like she like looks over from where she was like watching choco Who else is getting married?

02:03:49

Now, i mean no one's my lady. No way is making a terrible joke. No, i wasn't. You were the one who said that you were married to your duty and those blast i checked. You are a samurai of how someone thoughts you. So but technically, i guess i always assume that you just had a secret and deep love for shaka

02:04:18

No way. She's slipping slips, her teeth, or i

02:04:25

Uh-huh, every

02:04:31

I don't think, i don't think she heard the question correctly. How does she's applying a triangle? Here she is.

02:04:43

Everyone loves you shocka, right? Uchaka is pretty great. Well, she goes over here and pulls out. One of his old walkies prepares to commit original suicide, okay? I must say i am patterned but often i are very happy. Closes 10 door. Wait, i thought i thought she was like half full stage.

02:05:14

These are different times. It's also very clear in the writing that they are, they are quite in love with each other, okay? They regularly make trips across the high ice together.

02:05:31

They're they're very bonded was more Mario than my mother ever was. We're getting near the end of the book. So we now we need to just start pairing. Everyone off, please let us know. We're not even. We're like approaching the halfway point of this book. Not not anywhere near the end.

02:05:54

Well, i meant like of the AP, that's fair. We are in the second half of the AP. Now. Yeah. It's like i was wondering what spiffy was doing and Sandra's 10th the other day.

02:06:08

I know. Wow, that's what i wanted. What? I wonder if hey you too like that's very popular. I think kind of having a psychological group, it's very peter, pan and tinkerbell, we're all just disassociating. This is what the sport fairs, the spirits does to you. Like nothing is very serious about that.

02:06:36

She's like ich, honestly. Feel like i'm mrring a lot right now. Well, i can tell you. I was listening to everything. I'm more than happy to be the back for you with a different filter if you could. Kindly, that would be most appreciative. Okay. I think, what do you need?

02:06:57

Reminding of yes, very well. Um your friend ochi is having difficulty with his attraction to this wild kid soon and the teasing. Well well is oh excuse me choko because children how many details does this rabbit about to get wrong? This could be really crappy, really fully expecting. This to be the revelation, why youtube is actually the aspect of madness.

02:07:29

And i was like it's not gone and then we're just love for a for no way. And then there was a but that leads to a number of other things that it really wouldn't be polited me to point out without speaking to the people directly. There are many insecurities though, flying around this group, was people adjust to your new?

02:07:54

Norman way of life, for instance, i might go clearly once make you an OG feel scene, and part of the group.

02:08:11

A fucking told you that ride was gonna be bullshit.

02:08:18

And the monkey just climbs back on. It goes arm and becomes a tattoo. This ruins it for me. I was gonna let no way have dialogue with you too for like a really long time and then just turned to her and be like, who are you talking to? That's correct.

02:08:33

Answer all things considered that's actually the correct answer but then weigh-in ruined it, by addressing the rabbit. Yeah, the rabbit is actually better we don't we could still ask ask for that like we could all like gas like no way and to thinking she has an imaginary friend now swore that they had meeting last game.

02:08:58

We're way and ask. What the fuck? Are you doing here? Yeah, no, they did. They super did. But like just in the context of like, here by the campfire tonight, like just who you talking to

02:09:15

Uh, so nothing happens in that. Two weeks of travel. No, it is a fairly calm adventure through an absolutely beautiful forest.

02:09:31

Boom. I'm sure this place is very nice. One. You know, honestly been downright lovely. I was actually expecting a lot more to happen to us, here, little illumination on find it very hard to sleep here though. Or loud. Well i'll take this place over the crown on the world any day.

02:10:00

I don't think i've ever setting another foot in that frozen house skate.

02:10:07

Would you believe me if i said i missed the call? Yes, it's somehow suits. You no way.

02:10:23

Uh, a little before a month into your journey. My earth says this way, this way and runs down a path into the forest. Is that a toy?

02:10:45

Yes. Yes it is, isn't it? Extremely uncomfortable. I don't actually know what the what is the actual? Oh,

02:11:10

Uh i was sort of waiting for omeco to go, huh? You know, bring up the rear here.

02:11:20

Mayori whistles and a man. Clad in blue. Well, let me describe the opening here. The trees, parts reveal, a twilight clearing. The thick leaves blocking most of the sunlight from the sky above a giant. Wooden toy gate unpainted and unbarnished stands before the entrance to the clearing. As you approach an armored figure appears beneath the gate floating, just a few inches above the ground.

02:11:55

Friend, they are.

02:12:04

Uh do i make a check to see if i recognize what this is? It's a physician gummy.

02:12:14

No blue. I brought them.

02:12:22

He kind of waves the hand at miro, then moves up to him and seems to talk to him in a hushed whisper.

02:12:39

LG takes a few steps forward, he says. Greetings, i present to you the lady of amitatsu. Amico. We are her companions. What was your name?

02:13:05

You must all face? No, bro, present yourselves to him. He will not answer your questions until he knows you all sugar nods and box forward.

02:13:31

She kind of skitters around.

02:13:40

Coyote called in sick today.

02:13:47

It's all right. My gosh, there. OT steps up and bows to he watches. You impassively show, go follows and does the set.

02:14:15

Uh, greyson will go up into it when it's it's kind of like awkward and clear that he doesn't, he's not used to this.

02:14:26

It kind of vanishes in a swirl of wind and appears in front of you. No, no. Introduce yourselves. Okay, i read that wrong. Um,

02:14:51

I am shoko a psion of house. Omitatsu.

02:15:01

So as soon bros gays falls on you, a smile cracks on his face. And you feel as though you're welcomed. In this sacred place, the second his gaze leaves Shoko, it goes back to a fucking blank mask of like impestivity

02:15:26

And OG will stop up again and repeat his bow. But this time it'll say i am oh, cheat, sweetie harashi. Son of karaka arashi automotto to the armatazzoo's.

02:15:42

You get a very simple nod. Not the smile that shoko got because shoko has that special kids who name ability.

02:15:52

But you you get the impression that you're accepted.

02:16:11

Honestly, i've been having some problems with the question of who i am.

02:16:20

My grandfather's name was amitatsu.

02:16:28

And maybe that's what my last name is supposed to be but i'm still i'll make okay jitsu

02:16:42

He not stewer and she steps aside.

02:16:50

You know, dear also not sequoia.

02:17:08

Uh, greetings. I'm grace and slagged him. A nod.

02:17:20

Person has a surname.

02:17:28

With the spray begrudgingly, i just looks to come in the eye.

02:17:43

My name is Hatsuyuki. Seventh point of an alto and well, whatever, i am now i guess.

02:18:05

You hear in your head. Now, you are who you want to be?

02:18:22

That was you too? I doubt it, she kind of like, scratches the tattoo uncomfortably at i just like

02:18:34

And,

02:18:39

At that, uh, what she actually does is she puts a hand into her bag of holding and reaches out, and pulls out this bony red construct that you guys will recognize is the skull of kimandatsu that she's had the entire time and between both her hands, just crushes us as much as she can just leaves the bones.

02:19:03

It's like i was a thing and what i'm supposed to be at this point? I i don't know. But if that's the kind of answer you're looking for, then you have

02:19:21

You heared several squeaks and cries of fright, when the Onis skull is brought out and grayson, you hear the patter of tiny feets, the leave this area behind you.

02:19:42

Christian just turns and is like, looking off into the forest. So even though he doesn't say anything about what he heard, the other would probably notice that he's just like, not looking at everything. He's like peering off there, looking for whatever made the noise you see this. It's just sort of hiding over in a bush.

02:20:12

It's pinocchio, son.

02:20:20

Uh, and i did not have a token for him last time, but it is the shikigami that was possessing the the wardstone that you, the waste them that you fixed.

02:20:43

Position on the other hand, though, not his approval as the destruction of their enemies.

02:20:52

You are welcome in the sacred grove.

02:21:10

Is an exhale. From knowing that almost feels like, like i just a ghost of air from her lonesome you have our thanks.

02:21:29

Struggle. Nods ahead and bows, and thanks. And before proceeding forward, walking somewhat deep and thought the shiki got me from the waist stone runs up to each of you individually to give you a tiny bow.

02:21:58

One at a time. It's very cute.

02:22:06

I have told the other coming that you were coming, you must simply wait for them to come. They know, they know.

02:22:19

You know, he's trying to get like red dust out of her fingers. I suppose we will like them. You hear what sounds like a rattle on the top of the Tori.

02:22:40

Oh. Oh, okay, and you look up to see this little guy just like looking down at you. He tells his head to the side and he hear a little rattle sound again.

02:22:59

And lose that uh, knowledge points. Struggles going to try and identify each communis. They show up. That is a kudama called they inhabit trees.

02:23:25

Okay, i'm gonna save you the embarrassment. That's a kodama. It's a true spirit. There are treated oh there's a lot. Okay. I mean i guess that makes sense. We are in the forest.

02:23:46

Why are you when i was younger? My father used to say that the kami are you are much taller than i was expecting. So,

02:24:02

Uh, sorry he was supposed to be large size, okay. Okay, that's what happened. I somehow, i can only imagine that being can i just looks even to set you. You're much taller than no. They said that the common are, they're not like yokai, they're they're not

02:24:30

The wicked have things to fear from the county,

02:24:37

I'm sorry, as you hear about shadow warriors, thinking about me. I'm not doing your chores. Yeah. You have a wonder what ninja are afraid of.

02:24:53

And then indicates all of the Kodama. And it's like that. Where is my toshikami?

02:25:10

Machine gummy. Okay, i will you're not gonna fight these guys anyways, so i can just, that's, that's fair. Okay, i know that, i don't know that if you fight these comedy, you'll lose exactly. No one is terrified because she because if i recall correctly for Pathfinder kind of not not more, but so so side stories is that like becoming exists everywhere but they're only really supposed to be any supposed to fear them.

02:25:50

Really if you're evil or you've done something bad? Yes. Yeah, which is why no one is terrified thumbs up. I'm not supposed to fight them, huh? And that was the day a year after the campaign started when it took a hard left turn as they started massacring everything genocide for out.

02:26:12

Let's go.

02:26:18

It was the day that no way, was pushed just one step too far. Uh so some of the coming actually come forward, merged with their animal wards, uh but others that inhabit, the trees in the rocks or snow simply manifest in a variety of forms, both humanoid and other to do, shookichi came forward to speak to all of his friends about you in the hushed whispers of the kami impossible for mortals to hear.

02:26:53

Luckily for us all grace it's not model but he does not understand it anyway.

02:27:04

It's my jokes aside and one of one of the Kodama just sort of hops off of the torry and drifts to the ground like a leaf.

02:27:21

Killed his head to the side and causes that little rattle sound.

02:27:50

Genuinely battle dying. Genuinely terrified.

02:28:07

I don't like this. We can stop.

02:28:13

Sure. Princess make it stop sure thing. No. I you see no bro just looking at all. He's boring. His eyes are boring into you. No way like your guys's invisibility does not. Yeah m. Yeah. Which is why she's probably like just like a makeup. Probably feels like a small tugger.

02:28:41

So just like, please make themselves I am incredibly uncomfortable about this. The forest. Children. Do not mean to harm me. Oh yeah exactly. Which is the why shunko spends charge? Here, i hate you. You know that it is. All right, oystery and stuff. We had to hope that you would be willing to help us.

02:29:19

It was our duty to watch over the house of withered blossom. Choco nods. We've heard what can you tell us about this house of with her blossoms? It stands in a bladed forest section of the forest a day's travel from here.

02:29:50

What must have helped for a prison? Look for the only.

02:30:00

And yet they escapes. Do you know how we do not? We are forbidden from entering the pagoda and the more of the forest that dies, the less power. We can exert on it. Zoom the forest. The forest will be wiped from existence.

02:30:27

Shackle size, we'll do, our best to stop, whatever curse has taken, hold over the land.

02:30:38

Did any perhaps strangers? Visit the forest in the time before. The only broke ring.

02:30:59

Yes.

02:31:05

My word, a small bonsai tree was stolen by hobgoblins.

02:31:17

It is still alive in the pagoda, but

02:31:25

The bonsai was the first of this, forest whatever they are doing to. It is killing the forest and me.

02:31:42

Uh, so these aren't uh these are a type of comedy. These aren't to dry ads. Correct. Skill planes spec. Oh, i don't think i recognize this one.

02:31:58

If i, if i'm correct, isn't this like a really high CR comedy, the ones that are treating people? They are in fact, very high CR.

02:32:12

High enough that i don't even think. Oh, she gets it with a 24. They are CR. 15s.

02:32:25

So, what calculated CR would it be if we decided to take grace and suggestion right now? Great, whoa, whoa, whoa, grace. And didn't suggest that at all. And no way is not gonna snap here because if she does, no, no, the look on her face suggests that she's more likely to commit sapuka right now.

02:32:48

No. Yeah, unless you bring danger here. You are not in any, yeah.

02:32:58

I would be so afraid to put any number group of players in this situation because you never know when one of them gets the wrong idea and just shoots someone, and i'll tell you what are 15 creatures on the field right now. If someone shot one of these commies after all of the previous warnings given throughout the last book, and this one.

02:33:22

Yeah. Yourself like they had plenty of warning and opportunity. No way. You feel something. Take your hand. You know, that you're not a face that arachn approves, get when they find a spider on their hand and they're too scared to move. Yeah, you you get you get to enjoy that.

02:33:47

It's okay. No way. Yeah, it takes the same hand, it takes a finger. She's not believe you don't go walks over and extends the hand out to the same codamba, just one appears to take your hands.

02:34:11

Seen a practically harmless just land actually. Are they harmless? Like what, how, how tough are codama? They're probably like cr1 fourth or something uh cr5. Oh okay. Oh dear. Fuck your shit up. She'll go maintains the stance that there are harmless. So the shikami are cr1. The kodama rc5, toshigami r15 and zooichen are 10.

02:34:46

And home, dude can cast heel out of his bow. They're all range. Fuck no right now. Okay, you're not supposed to fight to call me now. Turn off. There's a reason forest, the spirits isn't settled by people.

02:35:11

You will go into the house of withered blossoms. Yes, yes, we will. I know the outside of the pagoda it is called the house of withered blossoms because the withered blossom plants grows upon it.

02:35:35

It is an unpleasant plant. She seems to have trouble struggling to say that about a plant.

02:35:50

Violet blossoms that appear as mortal hands.

02:36:03

When the blossoms die, they think of honey and horse sweat.

02:36:13

These will not harm you but i find them unpleasant.

02:36:25

But we know nothing of the interior. We are not allowed to enter.

02:36:34

Why?

02:36:40

It is not our place to judge, the upper kingdom or to ask questions. We are given our charges.

02:36:53

Have you considered starting?

02:37:00

But i enjoyed tending trees and i'm happy with what i am.

02:37:11

We can't ask you to defy your nature, especially if your nature is to be non-violence. It's we live in a world where we shouldn't have to ask anyone to kill if they're not, the kind of people who want to oh, it is not an inability to do violence. We do not like doing violence.

02:37:34

We are awarded and oath against entering the pagoda. The only were never supposed to be released, but we are not released from our oath that prevents us from entering. We do not know how this happened. Only that they are free and we can do nothing. You said earlier that a hobgoblin stole a bonsai.

02:37:59

That originated. The forks are our hobgoblins known in this area. Is there a settlement of them somewhere known? I do not know.

02:38:17

And anyone else think of any other questions?

02:38:26

Very delicately. I should try to take her hand back. He said that the oh, it will be picked right up off the ground if you lift your hands up high enough. It will just dangle from you light as a leaf, kicking its feet happily

02:38:49

It's okay, no way. Stay strong. She is. But the last time you saw her freaking out, like, even remotely as much as this, it probably resulted in immediate escalation of buttons. So yeah, she's doing pretty well. Um, this That good. You said, uh, You called it a prison. What, what?

02:39:22

Exactly. Is who put it there?

02:39:31

What do you not know that either?

02:39:43

One moment that is a good question that isn't in my breakdown right there. Um, because there's no way is desperately trying to put on her assassin head again and it's it's not working right now, guys, four or four or something, not fair. Uh, please hold that makes sense.

02:40:08

You do not know the legend of the pagoda, it was placed by the goths. To serve as the palace and the prison of the only of five storms and we the spirits of the forest outside to keep endless. Watch over their our enemies, but just as the only word forbidden by the gods, to leave the house of withered blossoms, we were forbidden to enter.

02:40:38

So that the guards could not be corrupted by the internals. I get the premise. Yes.

02:40:50

But this this this whole goblin. Did you, did you have direction? Was it towards the pagoda? Yes, i know you kind of go in there, but we checked into the edge of the clearing.

02:41:11

Okay. We can also sense that at least, one of the ones in there. One of the one of the only of the five storms. Yes, you know, i just assumed until now that there were five of them because of the title. Uh, how many are there? Five. Okay. Okay, so i was correct.

02:41:39

Um, what can you tell us about the only themselves?

02:41:47

I know the name of their leader and what type of owning he was, i know the one still trapped inside.

02:42:07

The leader of the five storms is a yayony. His name is Anna. Maruman.

02:42:20

And i'm gonna drop that into discord and a merman.

02:42:29

He is beyond any other ioni that has ever walked. Can make a check to see if i recognize what a yellow only is. You may knowledge planes.

02:42:45

I have to double check that for everyone. Yes, and or local?

02:42:57

Oh gee. Back me up here. I'll roll you the locals just to see what uh no. I knows from the shadows. Apparently quite a bit.

02:43:16

29 me br14, right? Because it's 15 plus there CR. And not enough is not enough force. It 10 plus they're CR 10 plus CR for common. Anything unique or strange or uncommon to your region is 15. So technically this is not on man. I'll give it to you guys at the DCR 10 plus 10, plus CR.

02:43:49

Um so i had to do that in discord that would be ochi and no way. Yeah. I know, right? Uh and a 26. Barely gets it for the wind. Yeah, i only the supernatural doesn't apply because it would be a 30 still 26. It was still very hijack. Okay, i'm giving it to you for you tion natives otherwise.

02:44:23

It would have been a 31 that's fair. I'm convinced the only thing that no i would know about it is like bigger only. Um, yes, a wind guy. Only is a huge only but they are apparently giants with third eyes that have fused themselves with the power of the skies and sky.

02:44:50

And stars, let's see. The description is a third eye, rest on the forehead of this ornamentally robed giantess. Her figure half shrouded in the darkness of a starry nights that swirls continuously about her. When we say glory to the storms were being quite literal with that thumb. I'm afraid.

02:45:10

And i really hope they provide a art for her in one of the books because i did not find any alpha quick google search

02:45:21

I'm sure this one in second dead by this point, if not, there will be very shortly. That's a fair point. Yeah, i know the lost general Kiko. No.

02:45:40

General. He was not one of the five storms, but he was a trusted commander of their army. He was a Kiko new. That's what it was.

02:45:59

Coconut, i can't remember. Yeah. Was that the only that we fought back in brainwall? Yeah, it was

02:46:09

We lieutenant.

02:46:14

Friend of yours. Yeah, we fought him back in Brian. Well, it was a nasty piece fork. Oh, they left one inch. Oh cool. Cool. That's, That's a revelation. Then thanks. I think it was like right before we met you. Yeah, you're gone there just a bit earlier. He probably would have recognized you and probably would have killed me.

02:47:01

Though he wasn't the one in charge, uh, was that strange lying thing.

02:47:15

The octopus. What? It's like a weird squid with a wand. Uh it was wearing this and chunko taps the circle of persuasion that he's had on his head these since you met him. What? I think that he may have been attracted by the evil because the okay kiconeo was a part of the original attack on Bryan, mall.

02:47:47

I think maybe that the decapuss hatched later.

02:47:55

All right. Well oh if no one else could think of anything. I think we should stop burning a daylight and get our get ourselves, too. I also know the only that is still in there. Oh, her name was name is mona sukaru. And what kind of only was she?

02:48:21

She is genoi is that also going to be a planes? Check, boom. Yes. And or local, again.

02:48:42

Um, oh my locals actually better. Okay.

02:48:58

I'm trying to think what i know, i wouldn't know that i can just sound like the leader of the five thumbs being referenced somewhere but not that

02:49:10

Uh well it immediately makes sense to you. Why hop goblins will be trying to break them out. They are a form of goblinoid, only.

02:49:24

Uh, sheila is not going to like hearing this. What he's not there. Never mind. Yeah. Why? It's a? It's a goblin only. Oh, i think you misunderstand her. I think she's going to have a great time with that information.

02:49:52

You will go to the house of withered blossom. Fun shoko nods. We will, you may find rest here in this clearing and leave on the morrow. We are much obliged.

02:50:14

He turns into the wind and vanishes.

02:50:22

This lady does that thing from the Hercules movie, where she just turns into a tree in vanishes and wonders into the woods and they could download all kind of just keep sitting where they are in their tree branches on the Tori. Rocking back and forth making that gentle rattle sound because i have my hand back now.

02:50:51

Is more delighted, giggling as it runs over to sit on top of things.

02:51:01

Thank you.

02:51:06

This one is still hanging on the shoko. Uh, shall go up finds a way to make himself comfortable, huh? Ah, grace. And if you do any crafting, several of the shikigami gather around watch you.

02:51:29

Uh, yeah, he does. He's um like stitching together, a pair of boots at the moment.

02:51:46

This one skitters off into the bushes. Comes back with some beautiful. Beautiful. Silken thread just only spool and opposite to you uh grace funnel accept with a an awkward like head bow. Uh, and we'll figure out. I think he might consider using it to attach the blood red raven feathers to the the boots.

02:52:17

But that's much further down the line and crafting them. He bowels slowly to you. And yeah, they just hang out and protect you from spirits all night unashaka. Would perform for them, something. Something original from something from minkai. But uh, he would appall it jies for the uh, for any rust.

02:52:48

He hasn't telling the tales of his homeland but it's been a while.

02:52:57

Uh, perception. No. Not perform.

02:53:07

Noise. Probably just gonna try and find the quietest place to just sit and not think for however many god damn hours were staying here. And it sure goes a dirge barge. So, the story is always super depressing, like it's, uh, What's up one? Fucking story about the thief that starves to death is in something like that.

02:53:36

Something about that, like

02:53:47

Ochi just lets him land there.

02:53:57

I think ladies actually gonna sit down cross-legged and just stare pass this clearing on to where they're going to go.

02:54:11

All of the kami are delighted by the performance. There's clap and giggles collecting you go. Uh, come morning time. They all return to their jobs, basically. Disappearing into the woods. Could you drop the other spellings of the other ownies that we got the names of in discord?

02:54:47

Situation of the owners not the commies.

02:54:55

Oh, the actual names of them. Yeah, well, just for the spellings you got the nana maroo animal room on and a maroona. Let me go to.

02:55:11

Muna sukaru. The least that's fable it's a minute. Just though, you won't know that part yet. And, and that's the one that we're told is in the pagoda. Yes.

02:55:34

Cool. Thank you. There's so many of these that i had to go back incorrect after just going off of an auditory presentation of them.

02:55:49

And my apologies. I'm going to pee really quick and then we'll carry on two seconds. There's no way our god's earth that noise, falling asleep today.

02:56:06

And,

02:56:14

There's there is nothing sane or like sensible. That you could possibly say that. We'll stop a freaking out about the fact that there's a bunch of fucking caught me around here.

02:56:29

Oh, the spirits in the forest is spirits, that's great, it's haunted, it's full of people. It probably just hate you on premise. Oh there's also these like incredibly powerful spirits that inhabit the very land. Don't worry, they only push the wicked people.

02:56:57

All right. Oh, so sorry about that.

02:57:05

So, the next day and let's get back up.

02:57:14

The next day, annoy is looking for coffee.

02:57:20

She will not have loved anything away.

02:57:27

Which i think actually incurve something. I don't think about it, but my arrow leads you to the entryway to the house of wither blossoms. Uh, stopping at the edge of where the forest starts to to die. This is as far as i go, but i will wait here to lead.

02:57:52

You back to the real. Are you bound by the same o? Even though you are not coming, i am more calming now than kitsune.

02:58:09

You did not hurt hiking. So i give this to you, she offers you her fan, Choco. Oh, don't go. Graciously, accepts, what does it do? It is a kikuya sensu.

02:58:37

Correctly saying that she's uh, choco's big time ego foreign for that. Uh, look, i'm trying i don't get the joke. Oh, what else? Checks provides the submarine opponent for spells cast by the bear. Okay. Uh,

02:59:18

So you get to use this effectively to be youngli from dynasty warriors and point your fan in a grammatic fashion and have it. Be the component for your. I don't know thunder. I know. I want to play it young wizard so badly.

02:59:39

Of forceful. Hand is a level six spell. Uh, it's it's baby sound. Yeah, by any other name, it's true.

02:59:52

Pretty good.

02:59:59

All right. Uh, well, i won't be able to attack anyone while i have this out, but can I still use dodging panache? If i don't have a weapon in hand, Okay, 30 crash. I don't think it has a, a hand restriction. Yeah, it's only if you, if you're doing parry improvoke where you might care about having a weapon equipped really and even that it doesn't really stop you, you know?

03:00:32

Yep. Yeah i can. Okay, then, yes, shaka will take this and hold it in his hand. And that's what he's going to be using for, unless stated otherwise, because this thing fucking kicks ass. It's pretty awesome. And she normally gives it to the party if you don't injure checking.

03:00:58

But it's also because she kind of likes you.

03:01:07

Majority thrown in my inventory or should i do that? I should do that. I have not yet, the animal calls softened to a whisper as the forest parts reveal a vast bowl, the ground. Thinking from the forest angle into descending rows of frozen terraces. At the center of the depression stands of towering porcelain.

03:01:28

Pagoda, it's walls and ease smothered and thick clinging vines and draped with heavy webs soaring to a golden rooftop. Dialysis representations of forgotten creatures in these stance upon upon the pagodo's walls, the band of huge thorny spines jets from its midsection, the king gardens surrounds, the pagoda, a frozen echo of past magnificence broken statues.

03:01:55

Littered the garden and icy clouds of violet blossome, stripped through the ruin. The overpowering fence of death and decay hangs in the air, uh, kikuya satsuza unique item, it's not in me item browser.

03:02:15

Oh it's it's in discord. So. Oh, i'll just make a custom item here.

03:02:26

Oh, that's

03:02:55

We should be on guard.

03:03:01

Oh, there it is. They actually have a leaf.

03:03:07

Ochi. Uh, i have a care old world. Prisons are known to be um puzzle boxes. It's always something else to them.

03:03:33

To hell.

03:03:40

What the hell?

03:03:49

All of my tiles for the floors are gone, huh? Oh man.

03:04:04

Can you attach uh a weapon cord to basically like? Well, okay, so i can't i just want to tie like the sensu to like my wrist so that in case i have to drop it to use something else. It doesn't fall into the mud. Uh, yes you could use a weapon cord for that.

03:04:24

Okay. Uh, i don't believe i have a weapon cord.

03:04:31

I was saying since it's such a light thing, it's it's literally a fan made of wooden paper if i could just hired with some string or something.

03:04:50

Should see if you can put it in one of those. Uh, hidden risk, sheath spring loaded ones, i would be good for getting it out. Uh um but that's not the issue here. Circle. Just cares about not getting it dirty when he needs to drop it to get something else out.

03:05:15

No, i guess i have pressed the digitation.

03:05:30

Are you period? And like a magical item is inherently more durable than a regular victim? Yeah. Like even if someone steps on this thing, it's not just going to immediately break generally speaking anyway.

03:06:10

All of the walls on the bottom banished too. Hey, does somebody want to circulate a persuasion because particular sensor and the circle. It both are competence bonuses.

03:06:29

I mean, i may google take it.

03:06:37

So this is actually up a light nerf for me. Uh, in that in that regard. Oh no. It like nerf. It's okay. You're sacrifice was taken in order to make sure that our deer automats are here looks as regal as humanly possible does does on the coast still have her head slot available, sort of headband.

03:07:02

Okay. Uh, can i can i just give it to her? Can i like click drag and then put it over her token. You should be able to give it to her. Yeah. From the, the little present icon to the end.

03:07:22

Give item omega.

03:07:53

Okay, now changes. I've a change.

03:08:04

Plus two, two.

03:09:01

Agree. That was a fairly easy fix all around.

03:09:09

I have all of that beautifully organized earlier thumbs up. I'm glad that it was relatively. Okay. Thanks, i think when i cleared out asset files earlier, i accidentally owls as well. Which means all of my toes, my map tokens were just exclamation points.

03:09:37

But so, how tall is this? I got up. Oh my goodness. Hey, goda. Is, i'm gonna reload because the item isn't working for some reason for me.

03:09:57

I made it. I gave it a little it's not giving me my confidence wellness. 120 feet tall. Probably because you put a plus two at the front of it, get rid of the plus. Okay, uh yeah. About 123 tall. It is quite the large pagoda.

03:10:31

And this thing and i heard webs and then there's just like spines that are sticking out of a like pot uh sort of. Uh, there are spider webs all around the pagoda and those gross looking vines.

03:10:59

This is why i gave you the warning previously that there was a spider of coming up. Oh, i'm i'm personally. Totally cool with the start of thing and frankly so is no. I better be fighting spiders than grab that spirits but um, yeah, unfortunately i have to be the ninja and i have to ask.

03:11:14

Okay. Any openings on there? Do i have to go climbing because there's a front door. We don't care about the front door. There are climb checks. You can make the only windows you can currently see are all barred with iron. I don't care if they're bored if i can see into them.

03:11:35

That's fair.

03:11:40

And if it says that i can make a climb check. I'm going to succeed at that climax. So i'm okay with this. You can actually make it claim. Shit up. The side of building. I have a climb speed and the plus 23. Yeah, the outside of the pagoda is easily scaled with a DC 15 climb check.

03:12:04

Yeah. You, you can see the cogs turning and and your local men just had she cracks or knuckles. Happy boundary isn't working for me. I got rid of the president, still not doing anything. So, what did you do? Okay.

03:12:34

Do a check.

03:13:04

As light armor. It's not. Oh that's a great defaulted to that. Most foreign jacks contents. Yeah.

03:13:24

Well, i don't know. Can tell you if it's, i can't see exactly how it's doing things. Let's move. It's category to miscellaneous wondrous slotless size, medium.

03:13:51

From companies you have nothing else that's giving a competence bonus. Charisma on right? And double checking. I'm pretty sure not.

03:14:05

Like,

03:14:10

He disables a untyped bonus. What is mediator is a train. It's working now. Little. The diplomacy is out of less 20. Shouldn't it be a plus 22? I'm looking at from sources, and it's 10. From skill, ranks three from it, being a class, skilled six from it, being from my charisma.

03:14:39

And one from the tray in the hair should be plus two from the item.

03:14:51

Let's try unequipping it and re-equipping it.

03:15:03

Let's try something else really quick changes. Sorry to hold everyone up like this, right?

03:15:26

Okay, i don't get it because i very quickly threw on to get into works. Yeah, i don't know why it's not working on your

03:15:38

Does he have the item equipped? It was equipped. Yes.

03:15:51

Let me, i'm just gonna make you a buff.

03:16:01

Arithmetic. Base skill, Compton's.

03:16:12

All right. Now i've got again one. Yeah it works when i use made a buff for it. So,

03:16:21

Tuna sensu.

03:16:39

I'm sorry, i deleted your item. You'll have to make a new one.

03:16:48

For you separate.

03:16:53

Or i'll get that set up the point.

03:17:04

But i follows an order.

03:17:16

All right. Um, uh, shrunko is going to, uh, let me see if there's any bus i could put us. Put on a solid before we move forward. Probably just good health. Last good. Hope is one minute per level. Focus going to spend a level three spell slot right off the bat to just give us all good.

03:17:41

Hope one creature per level. So that's nine of us. One, two, three, four, five. Six less than nine. Yes. Decidedly less than nine. Okay, it might come in handy, quick. God's bless.

03:18:13

Yeah i don't know uh just confirming we don't have that waste of blessing anymore. Right? Because i was supposed to last just one week. Oh that's correct. That is that is gone. What level is bless that? Does it change my technically 10th? But it doesn't really change what it does for.

03:18:35

You just, it's duration.

03:18:44

Okay. Well, we have 35 seconds of good. Oh, before we came here. Uh, shoko would have told a chaletu that this is a pagoda filled with goblins log goblins and a goblinoid owning and asked if she wanted to come along, or should i not do that? It's not too many dmm.

03:19:01

She's gonna keep guarding the caravan you guys. Okay. Your favorite. Hey chelele do is a favor if you see anything remotely goblinoid. Fire at it. Yeah, if anything she goes hunting in the forest for other goblin. Thanks love. But she's she stays to protect the caravan and the coming.

03:19:30

I mean, okay, so what do we do here? Should we? I have a really bad feeling about just running ahead. We have 30 seconds of good hope left so no, no. We have nine minutes left of it. Oh, i thought it was a minute. Oh, per level per level.

03:19:52

Yeah, sorry, let me just change my time. Rushing is probably not necessary. Says, no, i should begin to making hand signs. Uh, so the huge brown store is marked with stylized pictures of dueling dragons. Hundreds of open mouth. Dragon faces surround, the doorframe all leering out hungry.

03:20:18

Ominous, i don't see another door on this side over here.

03:20:27

Noted, a few hand signs and suddenly, those five of her who all look equally tired and annoyed at this dampagoda. All right. Just a good point. That's all. That's one minute per level certifico. Now, let's see here. Yeah, yeah. Some of those aren't practitioners of the arts, one of the clones are actually gives you like a sort of like tone stuck out, like

03:21:10

Uh, all right. The door gets a cursory look. It's there's nobody goes, like, sort of next to it. Exactly what's gonna back up.

03:21:23

It's worth your wife is i feel like graciousness? We're below of its secrets. Uh, it is super super trapped.

03:21:41

What manner of super? Super trap. Are we talking do you actually want the checks? I should probably specify. I do want to check. Yes.

03:21:53

Uh, well there's 40. There are a dozen daggers that have been set up attached to almost elastic like spider webs ready to fight to launch themselves. Basically, at anyone that opens the door. I see, i see fascinating and as no, like kind of cracks or knuckles and put like climbs on to, i guess, like into the vines that are crawling on the walls of this thing, just pulls out a walking just tries to cut them down.

03:22:27

Uh, you success. It is not a well-hidden trap, uh, and you collect eight kunai.

03:22:39

And or throwing knives. So, do you think the door will just open? It's a prison prison. Find out broken out of exactly.

03:23:02

By the way, this entire map did not exist this morning. I made all of this in a rushing, including the tiles in the grass. Very good one. Yeah, it looks quite nice. Uh, shoko ready, says fan and his shield, i might go just like pieces out of this lunch.

03:23:23

Like, i don't really feel like doing another dungeon guy.

03:23:30

I'd like to peace out of this entire fucking forest but we can't do that for someone. Looks a shoko said, we'd help. And i got a sick fan out of the deal. I just want us who your wife before we get out of the forest. It's not my fucking business.

03:23:52

All right, don't go hide this face behind the fan.

03:24:01

We're never going to find out if we stand outside the pagoda the whole time. Yep. Noises inside of it. Having a complex store. Oh yeah. Like what's your claim speed 20? Okay, then i then i don't open the door. Shit noise. I like 30 feet so she just kind of like grabbed something overhangers.

03:24:28

And there is a part window right here and now upon closer inspection appears to have a great, big iron mouth around it. Oh, they went stylistic with this one. I don't think this was one of shiziro's works.

03:24:51

Insight in this room. Hold on. Let me scroll down. Yeah, i recognized, this is going to be a lot of sorry, guys. But like information is power at this level brackets. Hundreds of stone needles and spikes just from the floor of this. Large open chamber. A row of iron grills in the floor of runs around.

03:25:17

The perimeter of the room providing what appears to be views into the level below. Thick web sweep upward from the jagged floor toward the roof. Some 60 feet above ending in a dark shadowy funnel. That slopes upwards into the farther reaches of the pagoda on each wall. A round windows surrounded by iron barbs.

03:25:37

Looks out over the garden surrounding the tower. That is the room. You were looking into no way achie.

03:25:54

Uh, i mean shoko apologies. I'm here that door is open. Why can't you see anything?

03:26:24

No.

03:26:31

Okay.

03:26:55

That's why you can't see anything. I don't know, bitch.

03:27:19

Mmm. What? No, just it's rather funny that i can see doors on this hole.

03:27:31

Awesome, bitch. I forgot to sit there elevation

03:27:45

Oh, hi top.

03:27:56

Now, you shouldn't be able to see them ouchy. The door opens to a cobweb filled hallway that runs both east and west from your current position.

03:28:22

Hello choco's right there. Choco, excuse me. Not not help you. You see a cobweb filled hallway that runs east and west,

03:28:40

What have you got so far? No, i

03:28:45

No way. Floors are empty, but done something to be architecture, right? And she's actually gonna basically speed run like the rest of the things, if there's no windows on there, don't worry about it. Like, but she will, at least check. There is another set of these round windows about another 20 feet up.

03:29:13

But all you can see inside of it is cobwebs. I'm not, i don't know why i'm saying. Cobwebs, they are very clearly spider, webs.

03:29:25

Yeah, so after trying not to trigger you, i'm sorry, this is why i warn you spiders. We're coming. No, no, i'm i'm totally fine with spiders. Um, on like and stuff like this. This is fun. Okay, so so yeah, she she does like a round robin of that and, uh, after you know, at the equivalent of what i can only assume to be given her fucking movement speed.

03:29:47

Uh like maybe 30 seconds. Oh, she like dropped. Serendipitously down from, don't get art as like. All right? So the interior is just height of fuck with goddamn godwards what happens in here is rock. And the second floor at the very least, is something's happened beforehand. There. So are you are you standing on this balcony and looking down with them?

03:30:15

Yeah. Okay, here coco will step inside.

03:30:39

I know how mirror image is supposed to look but nothing in my head is is like convincing me that noise shadow clones or not. Just like ochi, i see you starting to climb up. You know, what's going on there? Um, i didn't do that. Urine elevation 10. No, i think you might have hadn't selected when you were sorting out the Ah, yes.

03:31:17

No, a

03:31:22

Yo, this woman steps out of a fucking shadow.

03:31:32

So you guys see one of the five clones just well what you assumed to all the cleanse just turn from like working at you completely like what the fuck. Yeah, that would definitely test, but please these roll for uh, see if you actually stab me. One b5. Hold on.

03:31:58

This was before they released. That's for the site and they gave her a dagger when she is clearly wielding. Size, which is strange because the thigh came out. Well, before this book came out in that ultimate equipment, i believe, uh, you said you're at five of them. So yeah.

03:32:21

When number do you want to be? Uh one one is bad. Uh, but yeah. You want to uh yeah. So, her side destroys one of your shadows.

03:32:38

Okay, okay.

03:32:45

Boom.

03:32:50

Uh, do we roll initiative?

03:32:55

Yeah, you guys can roll perception. I mean, it's the sound. The sound of combat is a DC tend to notice there has been no, sounds of combat, yet, you're assuming sound on her part.

03:33:16

This is this is what happens when you you piss off ninja. Apparently actually good. She is actually very good. Oh no, i've just realized what you said. No, no. But did i say i don't like people saying that they come out of the shadows. That no.

03:33:48

Was a bad window. How the fuck? Oh,

03:33:58

Crying. Okay, i lost my shadow on social pop this down. Two, three. So before you can even act because that was her surprise round. She flares a bit of cloth over the both of you and vanishes into the shadow.

03:34:33

And by bitter cloth. I mean, you guys see a yard black silk appear in the air?

03:34:44

You i have any idea. What the fuck? That was wait, no way. Would definitely know what a shadow dancer was. Yeah. Okay. Wait over both of you. Like she takes away with her. No, no. She just made a larger shadow combined with their two shadows to step into, okay?

03:35:13

Yeah. I was kind of hoping you could get a higher initiative so did i but you know you did roll like a fucking 19. What do you want me to do? Yeah, that's there. I would have liked to have done something too but you did roll up. So i cannot uh, at least she missed.

03:35:32

The only thing i can do is try to find her because if you're using the ability i think you're using. I can at least attempt that Oh, i didn't blame sight not the ability and which case she's potentially flipped off then which is why combat ended. Yeah, that makes sense.

03:36:00

Yeah. So after after that, we also get the distinct impression that you were being tested. Well, if you stayed around for more than three seconds, baby, we would have got something going on there. But no, you have to fuck off. Yeah. You survived walks in and hit you through the front door.

03:36:21

Yeah, so you guys walk through the front door. Uh, nobody drops off. The drops off the ceiling. Uh, there is one less of her. Oh, i think you have gone through a wall. Oh shit. Hold on, i just realized what was happening.

03:36:48

I'm just trying to move to the space. That was south of shoko that was open and not a wall or anything. Yeah. There we go. Yep, i need to

03:37:04

Turn these into not being stairs, is what's happening there? That's how OG went up one. My invisible text for this is what this area is all. Had the stair function turned on. So they all elevated. You 10 feet, huh? But that will do it, you should be fine now.

03:37:33

Okay. Thumbs up? Yeah, choco waits for no way to go ahead. Um you're the only one who can who's going to spawning traps and there's absolutely going to be more. Yep, considering the thing i just run into. Yeah, i'd say you you're probably right. What did you run into?

03:37:59

Dancers.

03:38:04

That's about as specific as no egg yet uh to win like the other three. The other three clones garbage dancers. Yeah, i'm not quite i don't think this is a temple to seren, right? I'm not sure what it's a temple to anymore or what it was, but shadow dancers or terrible things.

03:38:35

You might want to keep an eye on James, a little more often than even, you know, keep a light source, preferably both. Yeah. Oh, can akoya cast light on me.

03:38:58

That's that's actually a bit of blue. A conundrum, isn't it? We need no way to go first, because she's the only one who can stay traps, but we don't want to cast a light on no way because she's the ninja. But if we cast a light on shoko and he's behind no way, then she casts a big shadow.

03:39:19

This would all be so very problematic if i wasn't good at hiding and like being ahead of you and keeping an eye out for traps. Says, no it not. Like yeah, just just keep smile. But yeah, until told otherwise she is going to be like scanning the entirely of the hallway that we go.

03:39:41

So,

03:39:48

It's a look is there equivalent of a like checking for traps as you walk because like in in five E you can move it half speed to check for traps but it is what she's doing.

03:40:12

Oh, that's wonderful. So you see what appears to be a deep hole filled with spider webs? So it goes down and it goes up fascinating and also likely how the spiders got in.

03:40:32

I'm more concerned that we've seen shadow dancers and no actual spiders.

03:40:40

You think this is how the demons got? The only got out just spiders, happened to break in.

03:40:50

I don't think a seal and headed by the gods would be that fragile.

03:41:02

And and more than anything noise is surprised. She's saying slick. Hmm. Actually.

03:41:10

Find myself strange, like hoping but it wasn't.

03:41:18

But i don't know if this is how it did. It spider web of flammable, right?

03:41:27

Oh, subscribe ladies. That's, that's less good. Um okay you can stop now you can oh you know what i would like more spider ladies.

03:41:48

Mayor was going to be so disappointed. No. Oh i did the terrible thing. Hold on.

03:41:56

Psychology works every time.

03:42:28

And to combat. I'll check knowledge. Checks, local, arcana.

03:42:44

Don't like it. Don't like it.

03:42:53

So iranier our intelligence shape, changing spiders with sorcerer's powers and it's natural form. Yes. Uh, resembles a hunchback spider, a little bigger than a human and weighs about 150 pounds. The hump on its back is actually what houses its brain.

03:43:19

Aim for the humps. Uh they're not actually particularly powerful, their bite is poisonous. Uh, but of greater concern, is actually the fact that they are still casters.

03:43:51

Don't say, oh no.

03:44:13

Yes. Yes. Come on, which is bigger.

03:44:25

That everyone for initiative.

03:44:31

So these women comes swinging literally swinging, like fucking spider-man out of webs in this room and or crawling up from the pit, everyone gets haste.

03:44:52

And then she'll go will move forward. 10 feet to take a pass. No way to act as a shield, the best he can. Uh, i can't move though for some reason. Oh, because it hasn't shut. Okay, and pause.

03:45:14

You should be able to move down. All right akoya and i might go both get haste as well.

03:46:35

We gotten deleted. Yeah, nope. Okay. That's weird. Is there a question mark in my outfit library? Now.

03:46:50

You actually managed to drop through of them. Oh, there. Good squishier airline expected. I guess like the spider women that they are and that's his turn.

03:47:18

Oh, it's you have something i want shoco. You are the target of angry falling leaves as this woman falls from the ceiling. Her web suddenly snaps taught but not before her limbs. Maybe collide with you. We'll see for the 15. Hit your touch agency. No, it does not then you manage to evade her

03:48:34

Springs back up to the ceiling.

03:48:42

I cannot take an air because i don't have a weapon out. He also is funny. And added one unfortunate downside of groceries, but i don't know, man.

03:49:20

But just for but you don't have to use it right? My mail a lot.

03:49:36

Field. If you aren't currently using it as a weapon, i do not using it as a weapon. You don't threat.

03:49:52

That's if you're not using it as a weapon. Yeah, if you so if i have it in my hand, if i, if i wanted to remind you, i would have to lose my shield bonus to do that. No.

03:50:14

Oh, you are you proficient in shield combat? No. Well i'm professor was carrying a shield. I don't i don't know, shield combatism but you know, hit where mirror image, repeat that

03:50:55

That's an interesting question. Actually, because shield bashing doesn't require training.

03:51:14

For the purposes of what you're doing here. I honestly don't think it's going to be myself.

03:51:22

It could matter in the future. If i need to flank with you, it's not in the code.

03:51:36

Yeah, i'll look at more into this later. You grew but you are struck by a magic missoul. Oh, oh no way.

03:51:54

Okay. Then i hit a little harder than i was missing something for a friend, says one of the ones.

03:52:08

Uh, shoko, they have dark vision and low light vision. Dark vision, low light vision. You should be fine, wonder.

03:52:20

So,

03:52:25

Up on the ceiling again. So this is only a 10 foot high, but great interesting.

03:52:43

This one, this floor. Anyways, that's

03:53:00

Why do you have a class and has their level of bonus?

03:53:11

Uh, um, not

03:53:17

Your second strike brings that one down.

03:53:24

Third, check to this one.

03:53:31

I was a little worried about the number running in here.

03:53:40

Yeah, he said target thing the like that from their my carpets and noise. Like, all right uh that one does have. Are you actually fencing striking? Uh, it looks like your macro link is broken too. I'm not sure why but i think it does have natural armor. There's only second will be so good, but now,

03:54:19

It is still alive though. I love to like go on and do something else but i did use myself. So i am boom. Then the next two up are the ones. That grayson and no way killed.

03:54:43

I mean that is just too nice.

03:54:57

Amigo has an 11 dexterity bonus. What 16.11?

03:55:07

Oh, what? I'll improved. Okay, to improve the initiative with good hope. Yeah. Yeah. No. She does not having 11 dexterity. It's got a lot of stuff that gives her impoverished initiative. No way in the background is going through some

03:55:39

Drug sword as she goes.

03:55:45

Stops there. Because no ways in the space. She was moving to stupid. Boom, irony counters.

03:56:01

I'm so sorry. None of their capitals were set up. It's okay.

03:56:16

And before i say for vibes, this map is kind of fucking nice. Thank you. I seriously rush made this this morning. I got soap pissed with the i can never get in carets like layering to work correctly for me. So i think this is very easy to look. Your eyes will be the spider tower from neo.

03:56:44

Anyone's played neo. He should or if i want to have, okay.

03:56:54

Oh, gee is gonna roll up and do a stab. Over here.

03:57:08

For those baby noises we're hearing. Uh, you shouldn't be hearing any baby noises. I will roll acrobatics if necessary. Uh you she does have a tax opportunity available. They probably have really good cmd big deal. They have like eight legs plus maybe some arms, they have been 18, like evil, surely the kami version of what happened in dragonlance this week, right?

03:57:56

Um, and 12 seconds since that went so well. I'll met a game and faint.

03:58:10

Okay, she's flat-footed. Okay. They're evil very much. So, all of my links are broken, that's really cool. Why is that happening, 19? I mean, that's a bodge. So yeah, fantastic. Okay. Why are all the links suddenly broken? One of mine isn't i think it's i went through and put everything in by level.

03:58:45

So i have to relink just for me. Oh, she does a triple summer salt to land behind this fire lady doesn't masterful the soleil associative to throw her off balance and then gets a source stuck in the wall. Yeah, pretty much. That is kind of exactly what happens. Uh, and you didn't level or anything that happens.

03:59:11

Today, like you had your attacks not too long ago, they were working fine. Yeah. I went through and renamed everything according to what level like got it at on my character sheet. No, that's why Miley you literally broke your hyperlings. Yes, i will go fix them. It was not it's not the same issue.

03:59:27

As whatever happened with noise flensing strike, i don't think it might actually be the same issue that Aarona is also dead. Boom.

03:59:46

This one skitters across the wall.

03:59:52

A reaction to i was reaction to dodging. Panache doesn't hit anyway. Even if natural 20, yeah.

04:00:12

Well, it will still she will still have to roll a one on a d6 to hit me.

04:00:23

She rolls a three, so you lose a mirror. Yep.

04:01:04

Link next.

04:01:31

Boy. Yeah. Going to step up here where she can see everybody now.

04:01:53

Everyone. Hears 17 points of damage.

04:02:02

Straight up over here, some kind of got it.

04:02:20

The great thing about shoco, stepping into that room.

04:02:31

Oh no.

04:02:46

Like what a sentence is going.

04:02:57

All right, that and

04:03:12

No, we're not playing nothing.

04:03:24

And very briefly becomes visible.

04:03:38

Why the accounting? Oh, because i moved her inside.

04:03:51

So briefly, now several more of you have woman appear out of a shadow strike and then vanish,

04:04:10

She around the corner. Okay. But she's simply appeared dabbed and ran like she appeared and struck and oh i forgot to rule her. She appeared struck and then ran away. Yep. Africa to roll first sneak attack.

04:04:45

Any more points damage.

04:04:52

Damn. Okay. So that was 21 points to damage straight into quite his back with a sigh. All right. So you see a wound blossom on queer's chest shortly after she finishes killing you guys.

04:05:13

She'll go. Oh! Hell no! Okay, five foot step back to see if he can still see the slip. The no. She's gone. She is gone. Uh,

04:05:36

Right? Christina without five foot stepping back. Could i just peer around the corner? Because i'm right here, i mean, sure. Yeah, if i put stuff back was just to see down the hallway, huh?

04:05:57

Uh, shoka will take the total defense action. Continue acting as a all against these two spider ladies.

04:06:08

Okay. Great then.

04:06:19

Uh, i'll start with the one that's further away.

04:06:34

Two arrows hit and dropper and then i'll target the one. That's right, north of sugar. Okay. Even with but no two arrows dropper.

04:06:58

And then, i guess the last two will be against the one on the ceiling, right? In front of sugar first arrow job sir. She's already sustained quite a bit of damage.

04:07:18

Um, just double checking. I'm allowed. Am i allowed to take a five foot step? And then fire my last hair or no technically yes. Boom, it's fine. These, these are not meant to be a threat threat.

04:07:39

Did you just gonna triple kill a quadruple? A quarter? Okay. Thanks for the the boost there. Shoko quadrakill Grayson is playing power defense.

04:08:06

You to do.

04:08:11

Aaronene then. Aaronene dead. No way. And where the fuck? I saw that shit fucked at that happen. And this junction is just like keeping an eye out. Like, where are those fuck does that thing go?

04:08:39

And there's not much else. I actually physically can do other than i guess. It was a technically, i guess i could try and um survival to see exactly where she's gone. But you said she just cómo está. I don't know. So yeah, she's gonna move there and ready in action to stab.

04:09:02

The first thing that, you know, it's hostile and appears in her area if she can dead.

04:09:16

I'm a code checks on fucking coya.

04:09:24

Yeah, that looks like it hurt love.

04:09:35

She zero is not available right now. Please hold shaylin the end serves she zero. Yeah, i'm making some weird kind of Going away. Where did she go?

04:10:09

But you will jump off of grace's shoulder. And go down to this corner. Do you see? And he sees nothing.

04:10:27

And then just because he's OG and you can do it for fun. He will double move and keep going.

04:10:40

My sense ochi is about to do something silly.

04:10:48

I can't actually see around that corner, but it doesn't matter. It's games. Pause. Now, all these remember that this place is trapped the fuck. I'm actually surprised i have walked into them.

04:11:07

Call me lightning. McBird, you are fast. There's a 17. Hit your flat footed. Ac 27 inch left over to DC. Yes. Hey, good news. I found her bad news, the bad news is you take 20 points to damage as a side blossoms in your chest. Oh, hell yeah. Where are you watching?

04:11:35

I'm sorry. I got slightly distracted. Um, possibly diagonally the farthest place away from you possible.

04:11:46

The food that are in a deadere.

04:11:53

Uh, well, if you're 60 feet away from me, then i think hey, swears off on you. No, it's already guessed. Oh, that healing is not for you. Oh, it's from the rundo. That's right. No more hasten. That's fine. I still would have made it over here.

04:12:13

Boom.

04:12:19

And i assume a 37 beats your cmd, me? So yeah, so this woman up here is from shadows stabs you in the chest, then back flips, definitely away from you. And that she does. Um, so since this is still, my turn, i'm going to call out as a free action.

04:12:46

She's here in the far corner. I mean, it's not still your turn. It was her turn. It wasn't. I thought she was taking her attack of opportunity. When all right when you move. Yeah. Okay. Well i thought that that was her attack of opportunity was the one attacked and then now she'd moved away from me as her turn on her turn.

04:13:07

Yes. Because koya, just healed herself. And then we're back at the top of the rounds on the customers turn, okay? For she has a 29. Gotcha, i don't like the dice that you're rolling. These guys initiative with. Can i have them? And she didn't attack again because she no longer has the upper hand.

04:13:36

She just disappears around the corner, uh, shoko kills the rondo. So that we don't suffer any exhaustion because it's only been two rounds. Um, if this hallway is as wide as the other ones, it looks like the wall tile. Maybe extends one further because i couldn't actually i can't see it's not.

04:13:53

Oh, okay, there's more wall there. She was standing here. Okay, i was curious to see how far you would get with your double moon. I could have got farther, i just went to the corner to peek around the corner. I thought.

04:14:17

Well, i think that was the i think we might just have to live with that bitch. Just a harassing us all the way up the tower until we corner.

04:14:32

After a few seconds, you see, no haircut. I've slip out of invisibility in all four of her, like, nod stage, like pipesville had no idea what they were doing when they put a shadow dancer in my hands. Oh no. I think they did.

04:14:51

Circle will step up to the edge of the hole and look down.

04:15:00

Balloon. I actually have a description of it. An OG will come back around the corner, television, a warm freeze carrying. The unpleasant smell of decay wops upwards from this web filled shaft as long shaft appears. Oh actually you probably can't see the bottom. No you have only original. So with your your lights, you can tell that it's about a hundred feet deep.

04:15:32

It doesn't look like anything is down there. Like maybe a tunnel system that involved rolling somewhere else. Boom. And it looks like the top 20 feet of the shaft have been completely to have been completely smooth sides, making it impossible to climb them. By any normal means you would have to use the spider webs to climb down and maybe it's roll to pure.

04:16:12

To.

04:16:17

Touching a spider web. Are they sticky or are they called, webs? They are very sticky like it. I don't know if she'll go can pull his hand free after touching one of them.

04:16:31

Sorry, i shouldn't laugh at that. Uh, because if you touch in a redneas web, you immediately be

04:16:41

Oh uh okay guys. As shoko is trying to pull free like his single index finger like the web with. Oh, it is very strong living. What's the fox doing this time? I don't know, was he doing this side? But what is a lot stronger than it looks. Oh yes.

04:17:05

The r5 against everything. Three of. No, i just just look at you dead pattern. Those light. This is why, how are you not dead yet, circle pulls out. His wavelenated starts trying to solve his saw the web off, and it doesn't work, because i don't think he could well, he can, he could do a d6 of dent.

04:17:33

Well, i know the minus strength. No, the minus strikes me. Oh i know. Well, my white blade has agile so i can just do. That's right. That's the whole fucking purpose of the thing.

04:17:46

Looks like there's jagged stone spikes at the bottom.

04:17:56

Oh, this similar to what they did upstairs. I wonder, uh, yes. It has becoming increasingly obvious that the arena have some sort of power to manipulate stone, which means you are not dealing with normal arena.

04:18:14

Crazy spider. Bitches. We will eventually hack my wife free of the the web. You do you? Um so each strand of have five hit points and dr5 everything. So i actually only did three damage to it so i'm going to assume they're not considered i click the web. You you catch yourself free.

04:18:41

Not considered what objects? The webs, they're not considered objects. No, that is a good thing.

04:18:54

That is that is a very good thing, but okay, yeah. So um, so do we have a way down here? That wouldn't be climbing the very sticky. Spider web. No the walls for 20 feet down are completely smooth. As if someone was stone shapes smooth the walls so that people could not claim down.

04:19:19

Even with a someone with a climb speed and someone with a claim speed kind of could no, i looks at you. No. No, i can't because the funny thing about being a ninja is you get trained to climb things that are not entirely vertical vertices. First my way of saying that, well, final literally doesn't let me do that.

04:19:41

It really should end, which is why i was kind of like, yeah, even if it's a completely smooth wall, wouldn't of repelling down with a rope work but that's repelling down with a rope, not just climbing down, okay? That's, that's with hand holds and anchored rope to carry you.

04:19:57

But the major point here is that there is no space for you to go through this hole without getting entangled by spiderwebs well shoko, could try setting it on fire and destroy the only way to get them. All right. You do? We have a lot of fruits. Why am i asking you're all casters you cheat?

04:20:24

Do we want to try and make our way down or do we want to keep going up? I mean are we here to descend into the spider kingdom? I thought we were here to search the pagoda quite Soco nods and says, i mean it seems clear that these are running a are winning.

04:20:45

Whatever war they're waging in here, but we do still have several level levels. More of the code to go up.

04:20:57

I'm understanding correctly. If you follow those strums, i'm assuming that must lead further into the ceiling because there's no actual way to step up that i can see unless OG it's or something they continues around. There's stuff on this other side of the hallway.

04:21:22

Yeah, this whole thing circles, all the way around,

04:21:28

Was that? It was what? Oh, i see it. Stairs wherever. Yeah. Okay. I thought i thought two, that was just you guys moving. Okay. Well, why did grace and get to move after it was paused. What the hell? His his movement had already started. I paused it halfway through his movement, uh, because his movement took him directly over a trap.

04:22:04

Doesn't mean scroll back to the beginning? Why why wouldn't we just follow the path that oh she's already gone down? Which i don't understand. Okay. Rain of flying daggers all targets enough. 15 foot cone and it is pointed towards the entryway. Not the stairs, so you don't get ochy with it.

04:22:37

So it's just grayson.

04:22:41

I don't know if that's a celebratory thing or not. Probably.

04:22:51

Plus grace in a 30 40 to hit you. Oh, that does it?

04:23:05

A lot of damage.

04:23:11

17 points of damage. Just dozens of little kunai impaled you from a wall.

04:23:25

That's the best trap they got. That we've already taken from the door. How old they seen? Uh, they don't they seem new And then he'll keep walking down to to meet up with Uchi.

04:23:49

Uh and hill. You know i have he's sitting in my bag for a long time. He'll drink two potions of cure like ones. Um, so i thought that he just went straight.

04:24:09

No, it's just gonna check before unless she does. So she's gonna use light steps. So if it's any pressure plate related stuff, it doesn't trigger it was like pressure plate right here that triggered and it has already been triggered. And already used paranor. I would, once again suggest that we let, no a take the lead on these.

04:24:34

Um, by the way, is everyone good to keep going? Uh we did like have an hour that got cut off of the game. Yeah, we do need to stop pretty soon because i'm running a keeper game at seven but i wanted to complete this before at least. Okay, and i know grace is going with the time constraints sometimes.

04:24:56

So, we are about finished though, with the ground floor.

04:25:04

All right, so as everybody else walks up prices, it feels like holding kunai out of his chest and chugging potions.

04:25:13

Another eight kunai? What? No, that's how many he pulls out of himself. Um, but we're fired with from the trap. I should say, roco is gonna say so regular. Crew nine eyes. I do not think these traps were set by the gods who built this place, nor i I don't think they would do much to hamper the escape of a guy only.

04:25:55

Also.

04:26:03

Congratulations. You have made it upstairs, though. I do need to, i am not on fire. You are not on fire.

04:26:19

Wonderful.

04:26:24

All right. I will give you the description of this area.

04:26:33

What is the?

04:26:44

Uh, i forgot to did. I describe the room that you were just in the core on the of the pagoda on this floor has been gutted. The few remaining walls in this area are crumbling and only the presence of four. Huge stone pillars, carved with pictures of battling dragons.

04:27:02

Seems to keep the building up thick. Webs fill the four corners of this room. The central section of the pagoda has suffered the most with a great rip in the floor, creating a steep weld pit slipping down to a dark shaft chokes with webs.

04:27:23

And now the new floor that you are on the walk of lacquered screens tall black lacquard screens with prancing dragons designs. Turn this corridor into a twisting maze.

04:27:40

Got to say that. I don't, i don't much sure across the stability of this place. Especially seeing what we sought down there. I feel like if the RNA or so inclined to bring the whole place down on our heads, and you have to sit and not those killers. Looked undamaged in every way.

04:28:02

Just, by the way foundations there. It's just the surrounding infrastructure. That seems to be a bit of mess, besides, whoever is messing with the architecture is certainly being creative with it.

04:28:25

All right, this is where we are going to call it.

04:28:42

Screens. Imagine why? They'd want to do that.

04:28:53

This this book is punishing me. They're not going shadow done. So,

04:28:59

I mean, we all knew that i was gonna get to use the actual competent ninja at some point. We all knew it was coming. Yeah, that's why it's so annoy is not happy about this place. Push, right, it's coming right? Oh oh no actually actually good assassins. Oh no, i'll be back to chat a bit more, but i got a i got a sort of dinner for myself i as well have to go and sort of dinner and feed my animals, and then go run Kingmaker.

04:29:30

I hope everyone had fun. Welcome to the house of withered blossoms. I actually really enjoyed making this map. It's really stunning. It's exquisite. Thank you. Is it is it of the the map that's in the book? Or uh, it is based on the map. That's in the book and updated with hd graphics that i put together by hand on incarnate.

04:29:56

God damn, so insane. Thanks guys, i will see you next week. Thanks for the session. Do you not have to do that when it comes to putting making the the maps for chewy games?
