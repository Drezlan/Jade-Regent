Check, check, check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check check.

Check. Checking. Check. Check.

04:32

Check. Check check.

05:06

What do this is the thingies do?

05:14

Oh check. Check, what is happening?

06:01

That work, no. Check check.

06:39

Well, i don't know any of this does. Oh, why is it?

06:50

What the fuck? One, two, one, two, two. One. One, two, two, two one. Two. One. Two. Two, one. Two, one, two, two, one. Two. One two, once you, once you once you

07:27

Check, check, check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. What the fuck. What? The fuck one, two.

07:54

Seven nine, 10 11 12 one two three.

08:11

Three, four, five, six, seven, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. That sounds good. How about that? How about this? Two, three for

08:50

One, two, three.

08:57

One, two, three seemed like he wanted to die.

09:12

Alphabetic score.

09:23

You know, i have no idea why he was doing that. Being those out about it being like, oh well it's incredibly unlikely. I'll die. I'm like, well, we're not gonna set you on fire. I also don't know how he can just say it's unlikely. That i'll die. It's like no between if he was thinking like, oh it was oh, it was only the bunny hands.

09:46

No, it would have been followed up by my explosion. So if you want to take that and then like two no he's 19. He said it's unlikely. I'm to die when he was at 13 HP. A quarter of his hp. Yeah, because he was expecting like oh i'll take the damage and then i'll just get knocked out and then like he'll and and i ain't about that life in my games anymore, it was just super weird.

10:11

I'm glad i'm like, because i mentioned it, they're going. I was just like, i'm standing on. Who feels sad about this, right? Because i was like a super opportunity for your finally used boning. Hams and might feel like it was a significant payoff is sand isn't pulling punches anymore than i want to change my character?

10:38

Both said i was running. I'm deflating in that game. Oh, okay, that's better. It was about to say. Don't worry, this is, this is the second edition talk and and the game in which it sounds not attempting to kill me, it's not good. I see i see apparently my weapon just needs to like constantly change forms in order to maintain good roles though.

11:03

That seems to be the solution. I had some worse rolls in my life last night. Like we went up against like a dragon and he moved away from my rogue to attack to like get us all on a breath weapon. And i, i had an attack with advantage because the dragon was under fairy fire and three on both dies and then he lined up the shot breath weapon does.

11:28

And i was like, okay, i have advantage on this role to do because of our barbarians. Weird and i dragon ability, i forget the exact name of it, uh and i also have a point of its inspiration. So i have three dice to make this and a plus eight to the save, because i'm a rogue and i roll a single digit on all of them.

11:46

Hell. Yeah. Bro, i saw i saw. Something's got to enjoy the wonders of i nat wand better hero point. Oh dear. Another net one. Yes i did. It does feel great. It feels fucking amazing. I also got to remember the the rp backlash of every time a druid enters the party and tries to diplomacy with the animals and makes people feel bad.

12:13

Yeah, pretty much. Does that make that's the point. Does that make OT a goblin? Drew it. He's a druid of goblins, we were fighting a bunch of bees and i started talking to the bees and convincing them to go build a home somewhere else time i have a critical success of my overdrive and i'm not allowed to use it.

12:36

I'm sorry. But if i have even higher to hit that, you know, i'm sorry it'll start happening a lot more lately. As we level though, it won't because the DC scales. Oh well that's unfortunate. Yeah it's a scaling DC specifically to avoid being, but it's a skill check. So we can guidance and assist you on it.

13:00

Hypothetically, yeah. So the crafting check, right? So since i go ahead of you fairly often, it's it looked like it was going to be uh because wisdom based character and all that i could use part of my first action to assist you good. But guidance also locks itself out for an hour after you use it whole guidance.

13:25

Those, i just mean rolling an eight. Another check. Oh yeah. If you can ate another on turning on my machine array, which seems a difficult to what your drew it is about, i have it. Yeah, sort of not really? Yeah, friendly technology. Not so much, which is why he asked if you could build a water purifier.

13:48

But let's do a recap of shade region though because we hear about 15 after now. Yeah, i was sort of here on time today. I think we all did really great. Let's all just power cells on the back.

14:05

Um, i was thinking about this. We came down. Abby got shot. No way. Got shot. Koya got shot. Choco got shot. And then we stormed the gates, we kept one alive because showcode charmed it. Ochi also tried to keep another one alive of these hobgoblins. These they have some special title.

14:31

They're super cool hobgoblins with like armor and withered lots of their woosha armored goblins, Russia, armored goblins? Yes. So we did that shoko charmed one and was like, we're not gonna hurt you little guy, you're just a little guy and then OT was like wait we're not hurting them.

14:51

I'm so on board with this you want to lay down your weapons too and kidding. He was the goblin was like nah fam. And then they all got deleted. So, we talked to the one for a very long time. I don't remember his name. I never will again. How do i remember his name?

15:14

But okay, never remembered a name in my life. I'm glad that discord has them written down. So we talked to that one. He gave us a lot of great information and we caught his tragic backstory. Tm is that he has was born and lived and suffered his whole long life in this horrible hole in the ground under like the terrible, terrible master, that is another name, i can't remember.

15:39

The only who has yeah? Is it? I was just gonna say is it the most D&D thing in the world that i can remember the name of the hobgoblin, but not the big bad evil guy, but it's at the top of. So lucky one goblin and the party fold them up.

15:56

Yeah. Muna sukaru sukaru, they're like horrible evil dungeon that they got going on here and ever recruited all these or created. All these horrible hobgoblins. And so it's only ever known suffering and pain and and bad life. So we were like you could uh, not do that. That's kind of unfortunate.

16:18

It's not really your fault. And so before any of us could like further OTR way down the line of that like was pathfinder cliche of saving a goblins, we koi gave it out of giving him a little oath to walk back. The people that we found on the spikes of the gate.

16:42

The horrible reminding us of the horrible. Horrible things. I'm going to sucaru is doing here. They popped off the spikes. We talked to him. They're like we're just vanilla humans, please? And then so we sent the goblin on his way with the humans, things were said, ochi was very out of character and rude and brought people's mothers into stuff.

17:06

Um and coya had to scold him and it was very tella. I had this Telemundo. Yes, and then hella novella telenovela. And uh, we he also gave us the goblin also gave us the information that all of the rooms to the north, in the little keep behind the wall, sort of situation where fake so we didn't go through those.

17:29

We came into the death trap room, with the arrow slits, and the pit traps, and then the hill giants with rocks. At the end of it, fought our way through that one. Pretty good. People did cool stuff. I don't know. I was off in the corner. Just slowly slowly stabbing goblins.

17:51

I don't you're talking about you it's just it's they didn't explode as soon as i hit them and it's just like man there's a lot of work. You feel like a hole with three hobgoblin warriors in it and one? No. No it was great. I just don't know what happened with the rest of the fight.

18:08

Then then we came out here and shoko has a nuclear bomb. I i know shoko has a nuclear bomb. That's the button. Is a drum is what i gathered. And so, he bombed a, this is like, you're very america, here shoka. Was it? Like, we'll put a boot in your ass and, like, dropped a nuke on like the cooks on the kitchen, And then all the rest of them popped up were like holy shit, america, what's wrong with you?

18:42

And now, we're standing up here on a hill. Violent murder. Hobos, that we are who only occasionally, save one goblin to south our consciousness and that we have to you guys decided to get the whole speed of like, oh, like they've been raised like this. Oh, this is terrible and whatever.

19:02

And like it's like, oh, so what makes the difference between like that goblin and all of these ones? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we had that conversation too, good. I think you did specifically ask shoko that so you fully were like, so just real quick just for me. I just want to clear this up, what's the difference between the goblin?

19:23

We just saved and the ones you're about to drop a, a missile on the ones that you just story pacing. Incredible pain and fire. A lightning strike is a very quick and painlessly to die. I know it's lightning and sonic, so you crushed their fucking bones. Oh yeah. It's very much like a fragrant.

19:48

Like yeah, you exploded their eardrums and they started bleeding out of all of their orifices and their head while being electrocuted. So all their nerve endings were activated too. So they actually felt even more pain. Yeah, so i'm just trying to understand for my own conscience. What? What divides?

20:07

The difference between that one, you had a pleasant conversation with after charming them and these ones who were apparently. So, uh, well, i think i believe the answer of after the fight. We could have the conversation. Yeah, yeah, hold on, let's just go back to uncomfortable silence. We have to finish murdering this village uh, because also they are 80 feet below you in a cave.

20:33

Yep. They were the only ones that we could see and we that's it some of those can't see this far. Yes, some of you still can't see those other ones because they are 80 feet down and like 70 plus feet away in the darkness. So the think i got oh i think tribal war is the most appropriate song for this to put on.

21:00

Um, put on credence. Sadly, i don't have credence loaded into the game, no approaching the enemy camp, i believe it's the better one.

21:20

Yeah, this really says like drone strike, remorse. That's what i'm getting from, he's track right now.

21:33

Bully fair. It's still like i still don't understand what you're getting at. I like that. At some point last week, that i don't even remember this happening. It mayco and text chat says jalen and sukio. Equals friends forever. Where is that? I am confused by this. And now i'm imagining a mako actually saying this.

22:01

It's like when um, people use various like emoticon the speaker and they're actually verbally saying it like it's bad. It's like what there's a jade regent group chat that we're all texting. Oh my god, we were talking after game about something. I don't remember. I was pretty high that night.

22:28

Yeah. Clearly, we need the, the rp chat and then right under the rp chat jb chick group, text savory dick group, text, oh, it's just road trip. Heart heart sunshine hidden car because i am recipe links like shit. I am for this. That is happening now and it's just like, one one shot from Laurie.

23:01

Just going. What the fuck? And that is public, not private. Perfect. Okay. So we begin combat.

23:17

But it's okay. I'm going dead. Last anyway, and that's feels, right. Are you going dead, blast? Are you sure about that? Have you looked at the combat tracker yet? I'm on tick sock, too much. You sure about that. You shared about that. That's funny that can't see anyone else in those without that tracker.

23:38

Yeah, you can we can only see the one with our blossom borders. Turn it is. I think you have it set so that we hold. That's right. That's the new thing i did. Awesome. I am very for that. I love that. So he gets up and grabs his weapons.

24:01

Boom. And he grabs his weapons as part of his move action. And he will move his 20 feet and kind of shove. You hear squeaking echoing through the cave as people get shoved to the side.

24:22

Draws his weapons and moves outside shuku. So, i'm picturing this like uh, was it fellowship of the ring when they're in the mines of Moria? Yes, and he's like distance. Yeah, very very much. The good thing i got to, i think that's kind of how i described it actually.

24:45

Then there's left session. So like iconic, like, goblin, like little cry thing. Yeah. Yeah.

24:58

So how does this spell work? Exactly. Uh, so i, i say, i use my move action, to, to start up, inspire.com, inspire, courage, then, can i standard action virtuos so performance and then immediately start the, the blazing Rondo? Or is it like you may start another bar performance woman?

25:22

Does that mean i have to wait a turn and use my standard action? Next turn to start blazing window. I've always seen it run that you activate the, um, the performance that you want virtual. So to maintain as part of the casting of the spell so hacks. That's, that's how i've always seen it.

25:46

Run. Yeah. Barts are built around action economy in that regard so that that makes sense. Yeah, because otherwise you would just lose around for like no good reason. Fairly. Um, okay. Then uh,

26:06

We will be, we will be playing my dual map. My dual performance then, uh, as you guys here, the just the, the craziest performance you've ever heard out of shoko as both inspire courage and blazing Rondo, up doing some problems. Just assuming that you're hitting the drum harder just to make sure you don't have to answer.

26:31

Um, so still go starts beating on these drums even harder. And the echoes get even louder because this cavern goes on for a long ways and there hundreds of feet of open cavern, and all of you hear this drum solo. Very clearly. I just i'm imagine, i had assumed that i had already alerted the entire cave you had, but then you started playing harder and more.

27:06

So i'm going to extend the alerted another level out. Oh hell yeah i'm i was imagining that our conversation about so what like you guys hear it? Echoing them all. So what makes these goblins that were trying any different than the one we saved upstairs. What what makes these guys?

27:27

What makes it all the way down the hallway. I can't imagine no way talking that loudly but, but then she'll go starts. Riffing. The conversation, like, what makes what makes what makes yeah. What makes what makes what makes buffalo?

27:49

I'm sorry. I didn't think i could make it worse. Like you didn't and here we are, but yeah. Um so you play a lot of that's that's cool. That's that's fun. Um again heart attack um dark palpitations. Vegan. Ah. Oh shit. That's the one that gives everyone. Hey, i remember to turn on haste.

28:13

No way. I walked up to this. Legend was like oh fucking perfect darkness spread out camp and show goes like boom drops of you get drugs.

28:28

Um, she was like well she wanted to do it quickly and quietly and swiftly, so they didn't die in pain. Well, so much for that, right? Fucking fine. Then, i guess.

28:45

This is incredible.

28:51

Is, is that showcost turn? God leads us down and push the shoko off the plate, to end everyone's misery. You actually still have a fight with step if you want to step off. If you'd like to fall free, he has catfall boots. He'd be fun. You can just take a, a few bits damage you'd be fine.

29:17

Can you imagine being these hop goblins and watching him do that and then just jump off a eight foot cliff and flint on his feet. It's just start walking towards you, please drops. Oh, all five footstep back.

29:41

Leads against the wall, the support, as he continues to bang that drum Oh yeah, runs and jumps off the cliff. I believe Korea would be fine.

29:59

She jumps off the side, though. She turns the shoko falls backwards.

30:12

Quiet teleports over and steals his careful boots. The teleports i i was about to say, i presume she can tell for like 80 feet. Now, she also has a ring of featherfall.

30:29

But she is trying to bluff shell, go into things. She actually fell, let's get a bluff. Check.

30:40

Do you think i was looking like, i'm not falling for that shit again? After a miko? Did it? No way. I don't think. I don't think i can pass that. Oh players. Where where's my sense motive? I'm forgot all bigger, blood flies.

31:00

I do. I remembered some gloves. You're gonna win the wendigo? Sorry, yetis. Yetis jesus. I love coya so much. I've never resonated with someone else's character so well coco further alerts. The entire game came by shouting.

31:33

Within blossom warrior. This room was standing guard.

31:41

He moves 20 feet forward.

31:49

But yours is bow. Missing the musical.

32:07

Yes, it is. Oh, cheese turn.

32:16

Just let me google. The pathfinder acrobatics fall damage rules, what you can do is you can make an acrobatic check to reduce all by 10 feet and you can then do a check to as part of that, check to make the next 10 feet and unlethal after that, you're taking lethal.

32:39

So i'm taking six what is the dice for this d6 606 and just all going to fall from? Yeah, just a chill six d6 damage. Just a count of a voluntary cone of cold. Yep, please do not jump off. There is a ladder. Oh, i forgot about the okay.

33:07

Oh, she's gonna walk over to the fucking ladder and climb down the wire. Well, looks up at ochi on the ladder. You're wearing winged boots? No, not not. Yet on your sheet. I don't think they should be. I should still have the, are they finished? Let me look at the other sheet.

33:30

Uh, no, no, they're definitely not finished. Yeah. Oh, why are there in your sheep dead? I think it was a financial thing but that's specifically why i was thinking of not using them as i sold the other boots to help pay to craft these boots. So it's just keeping track of them.

33:44

I wasn't going to use them, i didn't think that i had them, they provide them. So, if you haven't gotten them yet, i'll be climbing. What's the speed for a ladder to climb down? Have half so? Or, or you can make a check and go accelerated at your full speed.

34:03

It's a decent letter. I would even let you quadruple. It just slide down the ladder. All right whatever. Give me a climb check. And i don't know, the ochis climbs. Really great. Do you have inspire courage up? I can't. I don't see the buff on you. Oh no. You just put it on.

34:22

I did not act video. Everyone should have it on. I don't see on coyo or on the co either.

34:32

I mean, it makes sense for koya because she's out of your range. All right, i have a plus 15 to climb right now. Let's watch. It's fire. Encourage doesn't have a range. Anyone who can hear it? Roll it and see what is a 27? Get me, you slide down at your full speed.

34:52

You're down at my full speed. So yeah i mean i don't have 80 feet so that's a double move to get down there. Also, i believe that's my turn, but you, you do fireman down the down the ladder. That's cool. I feel like my voice. We're good now exactly.

35:13

Grayson.

35:19

Uh, he will. I'm thinking of fake friends. Yeah, but the step and then i guess i took at the goblin to our rights mind is everyone's an altitudes keep falling off of them when they move. See i did do that correctly though because i put them on my sheet to make sure i could keep tracking my gold but they are neither carried.

35:42

Nor equipped my boots. My booties. I didn't look that closely. Yeah, i like to think too that for OG, this is irrelevant but that they're just like ankle wraps with wings attached to them because you can't really wear shoes.

36:03

Oh Grayson your first arrow. Kills that goblin. All right. Well, then transition us to just that random round over there.

36:23

If not on initiative.

36:29

Appropriate.

36:39

So,

36:44

Uh grayson. Do you did you take good? Hope off of your sheet. Yeah. It, i don't think it's been long enough for good. Hope to have fallen off. We haven't the last time you casted it. We were in that first room and i wasn't near the three of them that uh big arrow and forgot that i only got.

37:13

All right, it does take all of your arrows but you bring the top goblin down. All right, that's it.

37:24

Amigo.

37:30

Taking a page out of coyote's book.

37:35

Pops up village.

37:42

I really do not think so many of you would be jumping off the lunch. I thought we were gonna take advantage of our elevation here, all right, see sugar. And whenever we ever been smart and don't really want to throw fireballs into the darkness. She says nicely. He said, this is floating out.

38:16

She also better pulled up and goblins.

38:27

Is gonna fire at the lady floating through the air and misses

38:39

He was awake on guard.

38:47

I don't think of 23 hits you og well that were not flag-footed. He gets up and comes outside.

39:06

No way. Hey youtube. Can i ask a favor? Can you just spawn me a good old moon of city or not? There. Uh-huh Tuesday.

39:27

Boom. Boom. How big will light radius? Oh okay. Believe it has a torch so 20 feet right? All right. It's dancing like yep. Dancing likes.

40:24

No, it should be like a chainish color and you want them out there for further. Yep. Facebook really. Just light them up so good. They have to stay within 10 feet of each other. So, you see, as this, this crescent moon shape takes shape right over their camp. Just appears from nowhere.

40:59

Why are you all appearing over there? My mouse cursor is over here. There you go. All within 10 feet and the hot goblins like scream and cover their eyes. They look up at the the moon that is appeared beneath the ground.

41:18

Thanks babe.

41:22

Drops off the cliff broken. Heart, not actually. Uh, very swiftly just pines down because she can with her full movement and just drops. The last time throws are sword on the way down.

41:45

Roll frontal assault. It is that? Yeah, that's kind of I mean, he did call thunder and lightning under the ground. Yeah.

42:02

Choco. I mean maybe just think of them as like, maybe they're trying to give the, the hobgoblins like a chance.

42:14

Sugar just looks great all continuing his drum solo, this hub goblins streaks. His fury, which is tiny and furious.

42:36

Uh, and we'll take a shot at no way. And she's the one currently coming down the ladder. Oh well, that one fat you too. Just grabs it out of here. Stop kind of hit my bunny.

42:55

And goblins. Oh gee, this one's for you.

43:03

Freaky. No a is the the oh god, the team four star Goku of easter. Nobody kills the Easter. Oh no. If you kill my bunny, i am going to send these out of them.

43:25

As saying in the vein of i will send you to jesus. Yeah. Yeah.

43:38

All right, he is dead but he is not.

43:59

So, the cabins that are cooking. Uh, sound sound like they're screaming in terror and fear.

44:14

And he has to scramble over a rock.

44:21

Uh, they don't even have weapons, these goblins coming running out of the kitchen. Uh, sorry i have to. That's right. They don't have initiatives. Oh,

44:39

Oh, i had such a good laugh off my age just now. Oh my god, that's such a good fireball.

44:51

There's a reason why? No, i didn't even bother talking. So i'm just gonna assume that you you magic fork or yeah these awful dirty little goblins. There were unarmed and that you're murdering an electrical yes. Those ones yes like, yeah. Um, i'm looking at this. I'm looking at this grouping and feeling my irro alignment shift one stage towards people, uh, they have, they have no other place to go.

45:32

Unfortunately.

45:37

Holistic can do is make it as quick as possible. And forget about it. You can at least be a fashioned.

45:51

And last one. Oh, he was way inside the kitchen, so that's 50.

46:10

This goblin is armed my chat. Dad, did you delete it? I did delete it. Okay, because of the server leg, if it gets too bulky. Yeah, purple. 19's gonna miss. Boom troopers. Uh, these are regular hop goblins. They're just dudes. Yep. The the other guys, the wizard lost some warriors are awesome.

46:42

Men's trained. The rest are hobgoblins. Oh, that actually hit way in. Oh, you shoot the monkey. It did one damage. It did one point of damage. Son of a boy, end takes his first point of damage of the entire campaign. Was officially one of us now. Now, william pulls out a rocket launcher.

47:11

I am good. Uh, weigh-in does not have resistances. And now he turns into a giant golden monkey a giant turns super saiyan 4 he goes fellow tomorrow. Yeah. Something something wrecker. Archetype. Oh, dear. He's not a wrecker architect. He's an administer and they're not stackable. I look just for funzies, all right?

47:47

Boom, but it would have been very theme appropriate, i think.

47:58

Micro archetyped. Give him a staff. She'll go.

48:09

I don't think a 24 hits you but an arrow comes flying out of the darkness and embeds in the wall next to you. Okay, maybe up here is in a samples. I thought he's learning.

48:27

Wow. Okay. He's dead.

48:33

She's a great range. So i pricing is about, um, of an image ops. I believe i have one image left now. Uh, yes, he did have two left within the last game and it is now your return. Um,

49:03

I will delay my turn until after Grayson so that i can give him one more turn of haste before i jump down and give all the melee guys, their buffs

49:31

Oh, we will drop you. Two. Can i just go straight to 17? No, of course i can't. Uh, so you will be 1705. No, you will be 1712.

49:53

1712.

50:05

Go up to clear. With a glass of war here. He already won. He was before me.

50:21

I mean, close all of this. Oh, he leveled off. That doesn't seem fair. He suddenly game. This is an archer. That's right.

50:38

I hope you really winters open. It's like a pokemon evolving. Mid-back. He is not a zen archer but he is firing a bow. I hope he's so fucking scared. If all the hot guy would withered blocks, it's just more than archer marks. Um, why does she get another attack?

51:07

You went before me.

51:13

Um, he just made an attack against coyote.

51:19

I was i was 24 so with her blossom that just attacked me. Okay. Yeah. Nope, too far back. Okay, so it's quails turn. Yeah.

51:42

I don't like that. Was that meant to be a private role.

51:52

Now, i'm having some battles of which, for box right now.

51:59

Oh yeah.

52:11

Show show, go how it's done for you.

52:19

She doesn't mean she's too far away from me. Uh,

52:27

But you pasted when she was next to you, i believe it's a thing that they have to be within arrangement, right? Or to continue. Oh well then no one down there is with a range of you to have haste anymore. Yep. That's what he was saying. He's staying up on the ledge to give.

52:45

Grayson, the haste for one more round before he drops down. Snow, uh weigh-in. I just need you out of the way.

53:03

So many things on this map.

53:10

Boom.

53:15

Don't really want to kill the ones that are running. It doesn't seem fair or sporting?

53:25

Sporting the wrong word.

53:31

Depends on eight rounds. I'm asking myself koya, believes deeply in the right to travel. She does actually. Uh, and for her troubles, this one is going to keep shooting her with a bow. Why are you whispering?

53:57

And still get shit shot with an arrow. Anyways. Oh, gee

54:06

Okay, all these really cool rocks.

54:14

Is this like a little s path that comes up to the mushrooms on the right? Or is this? Just like cracks what where elevation lines is? This a fairly flat plane all out in front of us or is it like a rise that goes up to the buildings? No, it's just kind of rocky.

54:32

Okay. Does the name of it? Like difficult terrain or a spot that i should avoid uh this pile of rocks over here is difficult terrain, okay? I see. But if you come through this path over here, it's not okay. We gonna run right up on one of the withered blossom, boys, and gals.

54:53

And days.

55:01

Yeah, we're gonna run right there, using spring attack and we're going to bunk this guy and then step back a little bit.

55:26

That most certainly does bunk, okay? And then we will OG back. A few steps in this direction on that spring attack.

55:43

Little crayons specifically to let the kitchen fold flee.

55:55

Um, traditional target because this back fired under the south

56:16

Yes, him.

56:31

You release a volley of arrows at him. The first one he snatches out of the air and puts on his own bow. As the second one sunks into his thigh. The third one thongs into his torso, the fourth flies wide, the fifth misses and so does the haste

57:00

So i know the third one is 29. Okay. It was like, wait, i've read the 20 damage as the attack number. Yeah. Okay, and then the hasted one hits. He is still standing though. All right. And that's, that's turn.

57:21

Show go. Uh, also got to have been flying recklessly this entire time. Why not keep going? Uh, run forward and long jump as far as i can. What are the rules for that? Do i just roll a flat acrobatics check? And then we see what DCIB? Yes. You don't have the space for a full running start though.

57:51

So, you're not gonna get super far, okay? Uh, i'm hoping to just not land on coil that would be upsetting. Uh, acrobatics long jump is one point of DC per foot. You're trying to travel. So, every square forward you'd like to move is five, all right? I can i could be a 15 and if if you win the running jump, it wasn't running jump.

58:22

That's true. Uh, so what is it though? 15 dc 15 to get 15 feet is a dc 30? Yeah, it's double dc. If you're not getting it running start, so each square is 10. I've never thought about it in that regards. That is there's a good way to think about it, all right.

58:46

Then i guess i don't want him. I i just take a short hop and land directly behind. Oh yeah. Would would his forward momentum because he's also traveling down downward way into that. Yes, yes, it could. But that's why i just need him to roll. Uh so instead of making a long jump, i will uh just a hot down and attempt to acrobatics reduce the fall by 10 feet, okay?

59:28

Yeah, it was not gonna make that long jump. Uh luckily the dc is only 10 to produce it.

59:39

It's a 15 either way, but still success. Yeah, you're supplying uh well i wouldn't these fine. I have my boots of the cat so i take seven damage. Boom, that's fair. That's right. You take the minimum possible. Uh so six lethal one non-lethal uh okay. Um, yeah, uh, little bit of jarring, as you land in coil, looks over.

01:00:15

I think my knees might be in better shape than yours will ever be.

01:00:24

I'll make sure to look up a chiropractor, which we get to being kind. Uh, she cracks her knuckles.

01:00:35

Uh, what's Uh, throw the bus on everyone. Again, by the way, how far are you away from coit? You are 35 feet away from coyote, god damn it. Uh that means i can't get both of you in good hope. Um, what's a good thing that most of you already have good hope?

01:01:02

So, if that was just 10 feet of movement,

01:01:41

Can i get to take here? Yes, i can. Uh, we'll get to there and then throw out don't mind that goblin. He's dead. I was like, is he just paralyzed with fear? He's just their initiative marker right now.

01:02:13

That's a witches. Uh, uh, concentration check to try and cast in combat. Oh, wait. Does this guy even have weapons? No, he has nothing on him but of dirty apron and he is running. Well, let's let's get everyone running a little bit more aggressively.

01:02:39

I know how you meant that, but the way that i took it was like run faster. Yeah, no, no. I think that was i think i know what joke was doing ergo. I think that's on point. Oh, okay.

01:02:59

He said flee before your god.

01:03:07

Yeah.

01:03:15

Oh wait. That's one. That's one too close. Isn't it uh, one or one too far? Rather i put it. Yeah. The the square has to originate from shotgun not in front of shoko.

01:03:31

Course from your mouth and cause it's a cone. He's saying his template should have come out of his square. It's just being it should stop once. Well up. Yeah, actually like something so that one wouldn't be affected. That one wouldn't be affected. Next one will be affected and this one would have been affected.

01:03:58

That's one. Two back far back. There we go. Okay, okay. Okay, and then i will make my pc. I make a form. Check to demoralize them. Think they're remorse. I think i are tomorrow last. Yeah, this one over here with just watching this thickly green misk foam out of your mouth, just looks at you and goes

01:04:34

Well, the bad guys. I mean, i know at least some of them were shooting at us because i saw a few of these avatars, like, in the well, i saw this picture the picture of the regular hobgoblin in a few of the attacks that came at us. So, i know at least some of these guys were shooting at us.

01:04:55

No. None of them can make that. It was these ones? Yep, that's why i'm like he's like run faster. We will save. They need a natural 22 succeed. I don't it's thought of will save us.

01:05:23

Oh, it's an AOE demoralized with a lot of extra guff but it's right, there's no saving through. I so yes they are. All demoralized. Absolutely. All of them for a long time. That is a very different DC the rest of their lives. My gosh, again.

01:05:54

Glad i moved. Oh don't worry. It doesn't hit allies, just really up in green. Fog on ochie.

01:06:08

Yeah, let's target foam.

01:06:20

Taken chicken. All right. Anything go for answering their OG. Bullying. Some hobgoblin ships. You keep calling Shoko OG Shoko, excuse me, i'm sorry, in the back, get shak! It does. It's a new thing you've been doing too, this hasn't was never used to be a problem, i don't know.

01:06:52

Uh, but is that that's it. So, i'll make go. Um, well, now she can see the ones that are firing at you guys. So yeah, she holds up her hand in a little bead of golden force appears. And she flings it into the darkness.

01:07:19

It's goblin deleted his now. Goblin. Deleted us. Oh, that's a pretty good role.

01:07:32

You, you you you and actually just missed the guy in the back.

01:07:42

Things. Reflect dc 18. She said, catch this. She really did they shot her monkey?

01:07:58

Living up to that. Okay? I so yeah so you see something? Absolutely horrifying. You see the awesome blossom warriors you see the awesome blossom warriors dodge the entire fireball.

01:08:25

Uh, meanwhile though.

01:08:30

Thank you damage, guys.

01:08:39

Oh, dear. So there are still has a shutter clone, like one of her is frowning and the other one is like hot. The um, the amazon from futurama, snap some death by snoo, snoo, the smile, and the frown, and the grimace, and smiled. In the greatest separate people that are like, like, one of them is like catching it.

01:09:11

They're just flipping and catching her sword. Like, oh no, pretty good. The other one is like he's pulling a face. Like she's kind of confused about her. She just did a good thing or not as half, doesn't goblins die in a screaming fireball of death but two of them who were cooks and innocent.

01:09:35

Well, they're hot going through. Not innocent. They were cooking people. Let's be fair. Yeah. Now that we're down now that we're now that we're down here so that i can we can feel better about this shit. Go gets a good look at the kitchen. Are there human limbs sticking out of the pots?

01:09:51

Yes. Yeah. Corridors like emaciated remains that. We had to walk through to get here. I think we know what the hobgument about. Yeah, it's true.

01:10:12

25 to hit is a miss returns of party performance levels. Forgot. Boom. Boom charge.

01:10:34

A 26 to hit with a morning star coming at you. One day, two, boom. Oh yes.

01:10:48

And your shadow clone takes it. And yeah, the one that looks like pretty happy about the whole thing like just immediately operate some of that morning stuff. Finally annoyed. Now, deeply angry.

01:11:10

My phone. No way starts full round casting raw century again. Do you need me to help more? Oh, you could just keep on going unlocking for it. Okay.

01:11:38

Numbers numbers. I'm hasted honor. Yep.

01:11:57

What's the range on the haste? Uh, you're out of range. Your second attack. Bringing some down. Oh, no, you're unrangeable. Hey, how would you like to do this? Because you bring him down down the the haste is 60 feet range. Oh hell yeah. I thought it was as haste.

01:12:21

No it's it's a performance. So you have to stay within the range of the performance in order to gain the book. Yeah. Ah, okay. All right. Must be within 60 feet. That is better. Haste. It is until like the heart of palpitations kicking. Yeah. And also of people run away from you.

01:12:44

This, it stops. It's uh he just starts playing five finger Death Punch and we feel like we drink five months. Is that gonna be it for you there? No way. Uh, yeah. She she just definitely like almost gets hit in the face disappears and then this guy gets to be serrated and do you want to see a magic trick?

01:13:08

I'm going to make both of us disappear here.

01:13:15

Uh, i'm so glad i get to torment. Abby with tons in the morning, just to have her come here to be tormented by yours. I'm here, i'm pulling your character to appreciates photos. That's fair. I overdate is gonna get chioni to laugh, okay? Just reminds me of doing the iron gods.

01:13:32

I went to the entirety of iron gods with someone being like you're playing an android, but i want you to feel emotion and i'm like that is not what this character is about six fucking books of that. So grayson, the one that you were about to trade, blows with stops looking at you.

01:13:51

And looks at the one that just threw the fireball into its camp. Lowers, his bow with your arrow on it and fires shot after shot at omeco. So does he now do acid damage with his arrow? No, he does not do acid damage with zero.

01:14:15

Which thank you for pointing that out because i actually stole it straight up of grace and sheets. So i didn't have to make it myself group and gracings does have acid in it. How do i take away? They're an images need to be inside. Boom.

01:14:41

Fuck my life.

01:14:52

Okay, miss miss miss.

01:15:00

Uh, and you guys see a hail of arrows, come out of the darkness uh one hits, the makeup kind of fine. And she grunts a little bit and then another one catches her like low in the stomach. And she kind of stumbles back against the wall looks down at the arrow that just brought her almost to death.

01:15:28

Oh,

01:15:38

I can torture that one, right? Two, two.

01:15:47

Boom. Boom. I shouldn't encourage you. It shit goes response. Oh yeah. Gets another arrow. They catches the sight of her leg.

01:16:03

Dooby doo-boop, regular hobgoblins, do i. I think they weren't initiative here somewhere.

01:16:14

If you deleted all of them uh, that i delete the one who's turning it was. I think i did accidentally delete him. Oh yes, i did because they were right before koya. Uh, so you get into the network opportunity if you want it. As this guy runs, i i don't think he's gonna take it.

01:16:37

Boom purple. He gets to right here.

01:17:13

No. Sorry, i didn't check any of this earlier.

01:17:21

That was a mistake on my part.

01:17:32

All right, and you see him kick that goblin to death, as he chose to run past him christen, is this where you learned your zenhearted one? Not your buck stuff. Is that your mom? Grayson turn and fights.

01:18:06

We laugh about it when it happens on our side but it was really terrifying to watch that couple do it to someone else. Yeah. Uh, no, it's very happy. He's invisible right now and the the other stop short. They will still have moved some but they stopped short from running up to their their lieutenant.

01:18:36

Are they more scared of the fireball of me or of the, of the goblin? Grayson. That's the legs, man. It's the lake. It's the only viable form of unarmed attack. When you're holding a bow, that is, that is not true. There is such things as like headbutting people. It's true, but the goblin only comes up for like his waist.

01:19:02

So and he didn't like, neatly kick him. Like Grayson did. It was more like a Spartan kick that just sort of crushed the goblins head and chest into the ground.

01:19:21

Um, this one was never running. Anyways, uh, but he does change his target to shoko.

01:19:30

And mrs. Flawlessly with both, he's somehow aims at both. Uh, he ends at both chocos and misses both. This one turns i runs over and grabs a crossbow on his turn off of one of the awesome goblin. Oh yes. Off of there. One of their corpses actually ouchy. Oh, there's one in his square.

01:19:58

That he could. Grab it all move. Oh, she's gonna fight footstep in front of this special friend here.

01:20:08

Booking. Everything's on fire and shit. Okay, that's when i spending any key points.

01:20:18

Oh my god, i didn't check the haze box. Yeah, just roll another one. I am hearing myself out of someone else's. Yeah, i heard that too but it might be me when i'm pushed to talking. I have speakers instead of headphones anything. Okay.

01:20:48

Boom. You hit the top goblin with a quick through series of three strikes nearly bringing him down, but he is still standing.

01:21:07

Coming at you, with his lung sword. That's gonna be ogster, grayson

01:21:20

Ah, just gonna keep at with this guy.

01:21:34

Boom. First arrow snatched second. They're all misses. Third arrow. Hits, fourth, misses, fifth miss. That's a terrible role for you and he's kind of just like calmly's like leaning back and forth to avoid these arrows and that, uh, that fits because grace is very calmly, and very in control of himself firing them.

01:22:04

So then,

01:22:10

The shoko. Well if these guys uh want to be like that uh i would let you demoralize them all again to frighten them because your rolled so well.

01:22:41

That could certainly be something that i do.

01:22:49

But it would be quite cruel of me. I feel blue then killing them, 12 years ago. One the several tailed fox attacked. The hidden cup knowledge.

01:23:16

The fourth habakage sacrifice himself.

01:23:24

This wide choking is in the castle. At the end, he's called the swine showgun. Now, he's the swine. Cut gay is, let's go together. I am insulted by the statement, please retool him as a cavalier and give him a giant toad mount. Please that would take so much worth each of me, okay?

01:23:59

Uh, so the ones who are already shaken because you rolled so well do just freak the fuck out this time, they start screaming and scrambling over each other.

01:24:31

Even the hop. Boom. Uh you yeah. Not the hop gallon. Or the withered blossom whether yeah, i knew which one you meant. I you would barely succeed against him with that check. So he's still just shaken but this guy is also now shaken. Yes, but this guy's stays shaken and then this guy become shaken.

01:25:13

I will end my turn and take three more points of started performance. This is.

01:25:28

Certainly going through them quite quickly. Oh my go. The retrieves a wand. Wait, what the fuck did coya do on her turn? I don't think she did anything. Let's skip. We had an accidental. Skip epic, boom. I was like, why did she still have so much damage? That's not like quiet at all.

01:26:03

Boom. Boom. Boom. Soya kind of in a panic. Just puts her hands on the wound. And as is her way, the arrow falls forth from her party members body.

01:26:22

I kind of feel like with i kind of feel like a like a sheep hound right now just like these goblins. Yeah, you're trying to get up into the pins.

01:26:39

Sing them on all fours, because he's a fox.

01:26:51

Uh, shoko year within the range of that. Unfortunately ochi you're one space out.

01:26:59

That's okay. I know, actually, she would have taken step forward to take care about my coat. You're in it. I will take it.

01:27:14

Was so cheap. Oh, she's probably addicted to positive energy at this point, probably. So, this hot this not applying when i hit apply it might just be lagging.

01:27:40

Uh, this hobgoblin looks back it in a mistake as it were just sometimes the CEO shoko, breathe out this awful, green myths. Again, i just screams at the top of his lungs. And takes off running around the deaf legs. Oh no, he's just taking off running straight into the darkness.

01:28:21

It's hobgoblin is only shaken though. He draws his long sword, which looks like a dagger to you and charges at you. All right, i guess. I'm gonna pair a repost this fella. Oh boy, this poor dude. Oh, that's a really good role actually.

01:28:51

And then the actual hit comes next, actually.

01:29:02

Oh jesus. Uh, so how do you want to do this?

01:29:11

Oh, i catch the long sword and slide my blade down it to throw his arm and then through his throat in one clean motion.

01:29:30

So this hobgoblin mustering up was little remains of his courage, uh, charges at the invaders to their underground. Domain, possibly thinking of recipes on how to serve kitsune. Uh, what fungi goes best with tengo leg uh, smacking his lips. As he's comes only to be paired and meet his, his death, uh, to go to the fields of battle under the general.

01:30:04

Whose name, i can't remember now. Well, that's just perfect. The entire thing, susan susano. Thank you and falls limply to the ground, which he thoughts of delicious tengo on his mind. The cheater one is the black dino lies. The black diamond. That's fair.

01:30:26

This hub goblin swings at you, with his long sword, and then tries to slam you with his shield and Your skill with a blade, farts. Who passes there though? Yeah. I am also buffed six ways to someday right now. Uh, this hub goblin stares at ochi and just stares at ochi.

01:31:04

And then you realize that the hop government has fainted completely in his standing unconscious where it it was overcome with terror and just yeah and it's now just standing there with a look of horror on its face. No way. So fun fact, i have a fun charger line, the very stupid one, but i don't do it because that's a whole thing that i can do.

01:31:37

Oh shit. Okay, i don't gonna love haste. Uh, but before she she goes like thank you that forward, huh? Hello. Before you want, i don't really care. And then just takes off like double step lock, fuck you at mock. Fuck you. Mark. Fuck you. Windy now can can this wonderfuls and i see invisible.

01:32:07

I feel like i need to ask. Oh, chi was rabbit hops up to you touches you on the lake. You're doing great. Thank vanishes in a proof of jane. Smoke from there. Thank you, two for. There's like so much happening in me in this one guy who just having to go regular sword fight.

01:32:40

Boom. Boom, boom. So i here's the funny thing about that guy. Because how do you want to do this? Uh yeah. Just bolt. Some basically flashed that this guy is riddled in arrows. I'm sure he is and out of like, fucking nowhere. There is just a sword added directly in his forehead.

01:33:02

Like, it looks for a moment like someone who's just thrown it directly in his skull. And it sort of lands, these slumps over the sword gets pulled back out and banishes.

01:33:16

A picture, like, because of the cleansing strike. First, she likes scalps him like a horizontal one. And then after he scout now that that's out of the way, it just straight down in the middle of his head.

01:33:32

Essentially. So the funny thing about this guy you say well what what nonsense is in store for us? No, that was the funny thing. Yeah, the funny thing is he's dead. Oh, that is quite funny. He only had like 14 age people. It's crazy. Not rolled slightly better on his last reality would have died.

01:34:03

Uh this deep giblin the bomb is also going to run no way. And finally to mad at and that's how governments to give a fuck about presence right now. Boom. Boom.

01:34:42

This one continues firing volleys. Are clear.

01:35:02

Player raises her hand and then cast it towards the ground.

01:35:15

And moats of stellar fire and constellations come crashing from somewhere up above. If that dates are all breakdown, isn't queer's? Life story. One, natural, one, four. Sixes. A bunch of fives and three reasons. Yeah, there's we're all there's one. Three, one, two, one one. No, sorry, there's a lot more threes in that but it's still.

01:35:45

That's just like compare that to what my flame strike did, which i will think was in the somewhere around 23 damage. Yep, by the way. Why does she get 13 d6 to us? What a good question. Well, you you hold them, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13.

01:36:17

No, she shouldn't be getting that many. Her caster level. I expect for castor level is doing some shenanigans. It should only be 11. Oh, that's much better. I know it's it's a few less why is your cat go ahead and take off the three damage just just a cool 51.

01:36:47

I think it's something in the templating that's still in that it needs to be in those. Yeah, i found it and have removed it. It was more as convertible. Shit, that might explain my coyote has been so good though. I'm like quit fucking quit. Could she could just stand there?

01:37:11

She's like a druid. You could sit there and full attack her hasted and she was just out in channel. You just out channeling. Oh, gee.

01:37:30

Oh, each hits with his sword shaking in terror and fear. He's steps forward and just almost a shocked as you are and you.

01:37:53

He does not hit me and looks even more in shocked as the yuhi stabs, reacts to the sword in you and then shatters and disappears.

01:38:08

And then like, you see his lower lips start to quiver. Okay, this time, i'm going to press the correct buttons and add the power attack and the holy and have my haste buff on, okay?

01:38:35

Delete, boom. I hate that. You botched that confirmation?

01:38:47

Boo, boo. How you want to do this. He's gonna he's coming in from one side, then he's coming in from the other side and then the last one because he's kind of battered down his defenses, you just stabs him right to the chest.

01:39:07

With a guest, he falls the ground. It's really telling me that it's my turn. It's told me like six times. So it's i'm sorry. Now you're good and then we'll five footstep.

01:39:29

That's my turning us to Grayson uh tucker 10. The one it's kind of by itself in the middle there.

01:39:42

Oh, he's so dead.

01:39:48

But boom, unfortunately, does take your second arrow to cater to him. Your third arrow goes to the one on shoko. Uh yeah. That's the only other one. I can see the moment, boom.

01:40:09

All right, both your arrows sink into his chest. Oh no. Wait. Hold on. I applied the damage. The wrong one. There was a dead one under him. Oh yeah, he's still alive.

01:40:30

Shoko.

01:40:34

As the skies blade, crashes into the mirrored image behind the image, the real show, go ducks. And jives around before in a blurry of spinning, blows yoga's in the backyard learning to have a job and whale, please continue. Yeah.

01:41:02

Mrs. Three times. I think. No. Actually, that is a you hit. What? They have an ATM 20.

01:41:18

And he looks for you, have now stabbed him where he tried to stab you, and he just gives up on the universe.

01:41:30

Uh, may go think i'm gonna? What's the actual to stop performing again? Is it? A reaction reaction. I think i'm gonna stump performing. I don't, i don't want to use. That's another three performance. All right. People, which reminds me we are on round four of that haste.

01:41:54

I had forgotten about that but then everyone is aware. I might go throw several of those golden balls of light. That's the one in front of you shoko. We are um everyone except for grace and i believe is fatigued. I apologize.

01:42:18

Except this hot goblin, he's frightened.

01:42:37

Why are you lagging so much? Figure. So yeah those uh that heart attack you were always afraid of no way. Uh, it kind of made me feels like it's actually happening now.

01:42:57

Yep.

01:43:03

It's like you just ran a marathon and then like immediately lied down in bed.

01:43:17

No way. Yeah, yeah, no. Feeling great.

01:43:26

Um wow. I can't do that anymore. Yeah, that is problematic.

01:43:47

I can do just gets to like, oh my god, i have no idea sucks and causes a bunch of problems but you can get around. It's fine. Um because back here on on this dude, you see a lot of actually get dropped. I'm ceremoniously, turn around, and let's see, you can't see me.

01:44:40

Just love to shiver again, at the back of his head, uh, that sure can hits in the back of his neck as he kind of like flails all of a sudden because uh 30 points of damage with the shuriken, you hit him in the spine.

01:44:58

You have not yet cared like killed or paralyzed him but you fucked him up.

01:45:07

Problem laid out. She'll leave him alone.

01:45:17

You just hear hobgoblins screaming deeper in the cave.

01:45:27

Yeah, youtube, you might move in those lights like a little over the bridge. Just on it. Thank you.

01:45:57

I'm going to leave them above the bridge so that people can see.

01:46:16

Not like we're using the element of surprise anyway.

01:46:22

That's a real bright way of looking at it.

01:46:31

You get it right because i made light.

01:46:46

I have a pretty good one but can't wait until after i stopped feeling. Like i've down 15 points. God. She'll go. We've never felt like that afterwards. What happened? Oh, shoko is also surprised. Uncover regrets into an old man soco is just clutching and stressed. Flying high going.

01:47:19

So, we all get fatigued, you all everyone gets fatigued. Yes, for the number of rounds. You were hasted. You also lose hasten inspire.

01:47:34

Everyone take that off of your machine.

01:47:41

Oh i i don't understand why one he just can't. Let me paul goal it for other people when i'm giving it to them. So like they don't have contract of it's very complicated. It's actually because first edition uh it does auto toggle for chewy games. Yeah. It's just it's just nobody's going to do it yet for fucking.

01:48:03

Yeah, no one. No one's really doing it first. Edition isn't getting as much support anymore.

01:48:14

But i'm sure you could jump onto the foundry like discord and request a modern short to do something like that. Maybe, boom. That was koya. The weather blossom warrior is somehow still alive. I just realized he was still alive. Uh, he blood sleep for six, which keeps him alive by two uh but mostly he should have gotten these opportunity against uh oh yeah.

01:48:48

He's going to keep trying to kill the thing from his nightmares. Though, i will attempt to perry.

01:49:00

They hate us. I hate us. I hate how my sheet is doing weird things to me. Uh, i failed to parry you did but it didn't hit you anyways. If he wasn't shaking it would have hit. Oh, gee

01:49:26

We're spring attacking. Okay. Be run necessary. I just i want to do. I want to do this one time. You have done him more than once consider. Well i've never done the cool one like this where i like cool guys don't look at explosions like i'm like 50 feet away and then he likes slides in half, you know, so consider my attack from that square.

01:49:55

I just wanted to illustrate

01:50:05

I mean, the image of ochi, like your pseudo panting from fatigue while he does this.

01:50:16

Why are you way down there still? Because i did that. I just made it happen.

01:50:26

Boom. Pepper. So how do you want to do this?

01:50:36

I think he's very much nearly as tired as we are. So it's very easy to just go right across the back. It was neck as i fly by at mock. Fuck you, your katana catches. The shuriken already embedded in his neck and shoves at the rest of the way into his spine, killing him instantly.

01:50:53

He drops like a sack of bricks and these 45 feet away before he hits the ground. All right. See now we scratched that itch, and i don't have to do the flash that thing anymore. That's this session. We get, um, we get like a a shot of a freeze frame shot of ochi as like a black silhouette against a red background with, like the, a hard problem way in the back in the distance and then like a cool message, flashes across the screen like you win or something?

01:51:33

I don't know. I was with it.

01:51:48

Okay, interesting.

01:51:56

Uh, so is that and that's end of combat, isn't it? Uh,

01:52:04

That depends. Maybe are you all done? OG. Oh yeah. That's the end of my jury.

01:52:15

Christen still later peed up. Uh, okay, it's going to do the most exciting of turns. It's gonna walk over and start down the ladder. That's it. Practical time.

01:52:34

Uh, he's not like sliding down or anything. He's just calmly climbing down. Boom, boom. Oh, where is it? Where is it? Um, probably grumbling very quietly about how they always build ladder for taller people.

01:53:00

Uh, you guys here a splash and you look over to show go and you just see this

01:53:12

In the discord track that's that's about what imagined

01:53:21

Also, that's gross hub. Goblin water. It does not have the ability to be picky right now. I don't think he has the ability to do much right now.

01:53:41

All right.

01:53:48

I might go kind of hobbled over the wound from her stomach gone, but she's still kind of like holding it. Like it's still there.

01:54:04

Oh, she get up. Joko. Get up. Yeah. God damn it. What is going on today? Beautiful, princess. What did you do to us? The same thing as always just a little too hard this time i guess isn't some form of magic on the pagoda. No, you're just kind of we're just all having a slight cardiac arrest right now.

01:54:43

What it'll pass? No worry. Walk it off music. Oh, so we're actually going to okay. I i ended it in round four so if we're actually still in combat we're going to need to keep track of how many uh-huh practically a minute. Well, no, no. I you all nobody had it for more than, um, three rounds.

01:55:18

Wait, is it more than does that to be more than three rounds or does it hit it at three rounds? I didn't creature the receives the benefits, for at least three rounds. Most succeeded. Okay, at least three rounds. Okay, so it's oh is there fortitude out the masterpieces DC or you get fatigued for twice as many rounds as you're affected?

01:55:35

Holy fuck, we get fortitude since okay you do get fortitude save but what is its performance? DC, whatever you're performance. DC is make a friend. So what make me a performance check for the performance magnets? Oh no, no on. Let me see it performance. DC is okay. So it's 10, plus half your level.

01:55:55

So five, sorry, six plus no five. I'm only i'm only a 10 level barred. Yep. Five, five plus your corpus, so 15 plus your charisma. So it's a dc 21, fortitude, save 21. Okay, let's see if you guys are actually fatigued way. Yen is fatigued. I did not put away.

01:56:20

He had an under haste did. Did you exclude him from the haste? Just give it to all of your allies. I have to i can only give it to a set number of allies. How many allies that now? Um, one i like for a barred level so you can only do five when i like 10 i could do 10.

01:56:45

So it's double then oh oh. See, you have plenty to give it to the familiars. Then that i guess i get into the familiars omiko. Botched, no way failed.

01:57:05

Oh yeah, budge. Okay, so yes, everyone just feels miserable. Oh, she no

01:57:22

Grayson didn't get three rounds. That's right. Yeah. Oh greyson's. All nice and peppy and then you hear what sounds like a roar come from deeper in the cave. Oh, So, uh, should probably roll for you too. Shouldn't i why would you make my bun? Me feel bad.

01:57:58

Oh, my buddy. Doesn't skincare. What's going on? The bunny? Whose heart radioally beats like 150 beats a minute. Like i'm fine. Course you are. Honey. Could you just just come? Come here for a moment. You can't see it but i'm only imagining that like no i was just leaning directly on youtube like like a box table, right?

01:58:24

I just like to stay there. Boom! Boom. And as the roar echoes through the cave, we're going to take our break here.

01:58:44

Why did i do that? I still have 20 rounds of bartic performance left. Why did i choose now? To be the first time in my life to be conservative.

01:59:01

Yeah. Okay, let's get rid of the dead, guys. Listen, clean up. Oh, you actually named him the swine car guy?

01:59:19

Uh, the swine habakage i did, in fact, go and change his name, and we're going to take our break. I'm a little surprised you let the runners escape.

01:59:35

Well, i will, i will say that currently. Like to be fair, they were out of everyone's visual range at that point. Hey, they were but also i'm i'm only imaginary knowing doing things and in the same tone is like hybrid. But very first Harry Potter movies. Like i should not have done that, i should have done that.

01:59:57

Most of the group was just having this huge moral dilemma even our npcs now. I know, and it's only because you cut, you actually successfully diplomacy with a hobgoblin in the very beginning that now there's this moral quandary.

02:00:17

It's okay. It's organic RP. I like it. Yeah. Uh, if i could make it any suggestion for our strategy for the upcoming fight, we do have like this little alcove that we could hold up and, and like, four to five and not be pelted with giant boulders. You don't know.

02:00:35

They're a giants. You know, that's fair. I don't know that there are time. Wait we heard them roar and i make a check to see if i recognize that roar. Oh, you're assuming the giant roar. Oh, the swine hubcake roared because he rags, Nothing makes me happier than hearing large, size, enemies and the word rage in a vague sentence.

02:01:04

Like they might not even think generally speaking just hearing the sounds like ah yes, wonderful flashbacks. Wonderful. Okay, even if we can't hold up very well. We can at least wait out the um the exhaustion. It's only five more rounds of it. God, i can't. That's oh man. Wait, is it exhaustion or fatigued petite?

02:01:35

Okay. I was like that's that's a huge difference, okay? Very,

02:02:05

That is the price you pay with rondo. Um, i want to remember i have a last night during our D&D game. One of our guys came in with a new character only, for after the game. He had a helmet on halfway through, he takes to someone off, and he's like, okay, so this is my character.

02:02:26

And he sends art in general and it's just a picture of Emmett. And i'm just like if you know who that is player and he's like, oh no i got it off of Pinterest and i was like, okay

02:02:47

Fair enough.

02:02:52

Um, oh yeah. So that's the other thing. You're keeping track of the fact that rondo is better haste, right?

02:03:06

How so oh it gives. So the numerical bonuses is one fifth year level. So right now plus two instead of plus one, That is wide, losing rondo is so good. I did wonder that when like it, huh, using it? But that's why it has a fatigue cost. I had not been keeping track of that.

02:03:32

I guess i'll have to edit my haste here. I've just make a separate buff entire line.

02:03:42

Just want to make a second one because yeah. Um, i used a lot on my, my hell's rebels bored.

02:03:56

It glazing one, there's not let's give it a fire thing.

02:04:12

Change everything to two change this to blazing Rhonda.

02:04:25

And then, What image are you using? Gonna go just like this, this like flaming fist on this zoom seems pretty appropriate.

02:04:45

Well, what's it called? So that we can have like we can i can look at everyone's tokens and seeing a glance whether they have Rondo or up or not. I mean i'm just going to put the link in and thing and then you can just put it down is like selected.

02:05:01

If you want the image grazer,

02:05:11

Just that application engaged this to you.

02:05:33

Talking paste. Expect from

02:05:47

There.

02:05:56

Uh, it's i what is going on here? Why can't i make it make this work?

02:06:07

And just like, i'm, i'm, i'm copy pasting. The link you have sent me in the image browser, and it's giving it's not.

02:06:19

So, when you put it selected at the bottom,

02:06:27

Oh, select at the select at the bottom. Yeah, yep. So you highlight whatever's in there, get rid of it, paste in that one and then hit select file and then you should see it as the icon, okay?

02:06:43

Like that. Seems and reasonably.

02:06:52

Think i'm a bob. All right.

02:07:47

I like this battle music reminds me of price. We have nine.

02:08:51

So pleasing rondo is different from haze because i mean, it's stacks, will haste it. Absolutely. Does not stop the face level. Okay.

02:09:03

But thanks, keep in mind, is that it grants you the benefits of host? From the only thing that changes is the medical value.

02:09:13

Shoko. And the magnus is, like, did i just break the game or worry about worry about to double haste right now? No, no. You were not taste. Luckily is one of the more well-written books and that everything that should stack with, it explicitly says that it does and it shouldn't usually says something along the lines of like the second stratack does not stack, but thank you so much.

02:10:02

Damn it. It doesn't show my icon that. I chose it doesn't but i am appreciating that i kind of house. Nonetheless yeah i was like going through and adding stuff to my hot bar. I was like i can have this better after playing so much king maker. I get really frustrated by the buttons because i'm not familiar with like every class putting a fucking kineticist and king maker.

02:10:24

Why why? No, no, no. See. I'm i'm one of the heretics that thinks the cannot assist is just not a good class. It's dramatically. I think it's excellent. Yeah. It's it's a cool class. I think it's interesting. I just like, that's when am i ever gonna read about a kineticist?

02:10:44

I have to learn a kineticist to enjoy this game anyways. Um, but because of that, my fixation with all my buttons, i was going through and putting all the uses and per days and whatnot, on all of my stuff because i have lots of stuff now. And i saw the piggy bank and i was like oh this is absolutely, you know i'm saying i was like yeah we're gonna crush this bad boy.

02:11:11

Get me. Homie. A battle homie. I also do not much care for condenses. I do like the king maker kineticist, though. She's a fun character. She's not right character. I just like the kineticist itself is a thing is like as a chassis. I just

02:11:34

Basically, i want to take the bone mechanic out back and shoot it in the face. I'd rather written literally just drained your health. Yeah, it's kind of weird to me. I don't, i don't get it. It's just outright just drained your health, like prominently for the day, than doing this hodgepodge of like, oh, it's technically not lethal and it taps out.

02:11:58

It functionally eats your your, you know, feeling today? Yeah. Also, the thing about the thing about, you know, the kineticist in at least in a CRPG as you can, i forget, don't you get all characters at level one and then you can build them however you want pretty much?

02:12:19

Yeah, so like if you could find something that just wants a one level dip into kineticist venue can just make her into that instead and then not. You coconutist. Are you do not go kineticist. It's just it throws me off so bad because like i've already like conveyed to you guys and like even spell casting, like didn't make a ton of sense to me, king makers helping a lot.

02:12:43

I'm starting to understand how spellcasters work like a lot more from playing it, but now like you throw in stuff like a kinetic system like thank god that input like a fucking mesmerist or you know what i mean? Like any of these other kind of like, fourth or fifth class book classes and i'm, like, i'm not gonna fucking learn this, bro.

02:13:02

Is it not? Is it a stabby marshall, or is it a spellcaster? Like those are the only ones that like, i'm not learning a whole new chassis. The first easy it's basically just a bar that doesn't have to worry about stock components. It's not even that mesmerist depending on how you play.

02:13:22

It is either a, i think a better one, a better example would have been what's the one, the one that like gets possessed? What's the possessing class? The medium. Never make it into a CRPG. Yeah. You know what i mean? Like this. That's that's what i feel like about the kinetic system.

02:13:43

I'm like, no way. Am i fucking reading all that, you know what i mean? And i'm very much like a read it all kind of person but when you put that shit in there. So people who as a fun not experiment for those of us who played first edition and final fantasy 14, if i ever get asked the question, what class do we think the warrior of light is in?

02:14:02

Uh, there is no, there is no secondary answer. They are a spirit dancer medium because if you know how to play a spirit dance with medium. Let me tell you how you play, all right? You get a binder, you get it, you get a binder, you know that you put a4 sheets into, right?

02:14:17

You know, a lot of dms when they, when they're organized things to do that. Cool. So you get a binder specifically for this character and you print out six different characters. That's your character because spirit down so changes so much from spirit to spirit that it is functionally playing a completely different classroom.

02:14:38

So you have to print out, six separate, stat blocks and then just decide whichever one you're channeling and you rude from that one. Yeah, it is the most efficient way to do that by far. I've played with here lab. I've plays like with one sheet and kind of adjusting it on the fly.

02:14:58

No, the most official way to play spirit, dancer isn't literally just to print off six different fucking cheats and just use them. Secondly, i gotta i gotta run real quick. I'm actually gonna take my break now, but thanks for letting me chat about this stuff. My baby is moaning in the other room.

02:15:16

Oh, my tailbone. If you want to play the full-on guitar fantasy? With committed assist. Is there an architecture? What do you do? Oh, what? Hello, we can hear you now. Yay. Huh.

02:15:35

Uh, just like the actual, like i want to be the avatar for uh, yes. It's called basekenessist. I'm not even joking as you level up, you gain different elements, you just choose the other elements and then when you get to max level, you get the caps down and allows you omnickinesis, and then you do the avatar state that's literally i'm not driving.

02:15:54

Oh okay, it's kind of cool. It does make it very obvious where it is inspired from though. It wasn't supposed to be though it was supposed to be inspired by things, like carry the pyrokine assist from, um, Hellboy. There's no mine forgetting right now. Those were the main core inspirations in its why?

02:16:17

The kineticist got printed in with the psychics? Yeah. Yeah. But everybody looked at it and went, oh, it's it's the bender class because it is bender class. Yeah yeah. Even if it's on what they meant to create, it's what they created. So, no joke, are you guys finally going to use the terracotta warrior?

02:16:42

Because that thing has had a token ready to go for ages. I was just going through and fixing my bars. And yeah, i want to make sure they're all visible because i keep forgetting stuff like that. I have my tassel. I have my helmet. I got my tunic for crits that i've never used.

02:17:00

I think i use it once. So they're all right here on the bottom of my screen as pictures now that mean things to me. So hopefully, i will remember to use.

02:17:17

Whoever it is, that has the terracotta warn here. I wish you luck. I, i do not have it. I have a horses. Okay, baby. This is the dude with a weird horn. He'll be gone in a minute. He just wants to tell us tamales.

02:17:41

There's a guy walking down the street. Honking a horn that Sammy doesn't like there's nothing quite like homemade. Authentic tamales. Ah, delicious two british never had tamales. That is actually sad. I'm to european, sorry.

02:18:10

It is clay's turn. I'm going to actually get up and take my break real quick. I'll be wait. Yeah, she's gone from the breakfast on.

02:18:31

I i mean, yeah, the brick was that like a little bit for four? Those that ochia magnus who are absent at the moment.

02:18:46

Oh yeah, another kind of holding everybody up, but

02:18:55

Foreign is going to withdraw her one.

02:19:07

Oh yeah. Sit on herself. There's the nochi. That is me. And now, oh, you're here. Yeah. Sorry i had to grab snacks.

02:19:30

So i'm uh, just a quick aside. I'm unashamed. Spam enjoyer. And my girlfriend told me that she was convinced that the baby had like, slipped his diaper and peed on something in this room because of the smell of the span. And i can't stop thinking about it whenever i eats fan mail.

02:19:54

It's pretty gnarly. Uh, i like spam too. I never thought it smelled like pee apparently. So let me zoom out. See what's going on here.

02:20:08

I see no one. So, i will join back up with everybody over here.

02:20:27

Grayson, our crystal will finish calming down the ladder which i think was another like 30 feet.

02:20:45

Three there. And then another 15 and that should be, but a double movement firm. Excellent magnets. Are you back?

02:21:03

Okay.

02:21:07

Um, i'm gonna go.

02:21:23

Uh, you know what ochi? I believe in you.

02:21:30

I think i already have it on. Do you already have it done? Yes, you already gave it to me earlier when we came around the stairs. Then grace it. I believe in you already, don't you just redirects it. I believe in the me, the beliefs and grazing and judges.

02:21:56

Both my both my wife and i occasionally quote that whatever she needs like a pep talk or something. When obviously like this, i bring that one out. It's a good one. It's actually i've never even seen what it's from. It's just Erin lagan. It is a fold means, it's the only way to describe it.

02:22:19

My, brother's watched it, he's watched a lot more than me. So i usually just ask him if i'm supposed to like it or not for all animes. It's actually not in my test but it is a classic. And i expect it because we studio trigger.

02:22:56

These um leopards in the initiative tracker or about to give me ptsd from the leopards that i just fought in king maker when that sister popped out and gave like three of them. Haste, i'm blinded my whole party with no mechanic to like look away or over your gaze that i could find because king maker.

02:23:21

Hi. I'm back, welcome back.

02:23:40

So ochi an arrow from a bunch of feet above you like a hundred feet in the air. Comes down out of the darkness and embed into the ground next to you. Oh, i think based on that role it actually bounces off of my bracers. Probably fair. No, what is he doing to that pig?

02:24:08

They hate that you are hurting his spine. He is yes. And on purpose. I don't evil.

02:24:26

Metal.

02:24:31

So it goes actually jewish. He draws the line.

02:24:37

Wait, no. It's not Santa coach sure. It's it's um it's eating them. I think he does both somehow. It definitely does. No, he kills them and then doesn't eat them. Just to be cruel. Like, that's their own purpose. He actually just eats hot dogs. This conversation. How do we know he doesn't eat leopards.

02:25:12

He's just using the pigs as bait. I'm self rejecting from the conversation where there's lots of warriors.

02:25:28

He moved too far.

02:25:37

Leopard kitties.

02:25:44

I'm gonna trade my youtube. Doo. Doo, doo doo. Doo doo doo actually make that much noise because they're cats. Yeah, i'm trading in my bird for one of these cats for sure. It's just like, oh, it's a kitty. He's gonna pick it up and shove it into the familiar satellite.

02:26:06

It's murder. Trying to murder too. That's that's what all cats do. When you pick them up, that's fair. It's true. Like this to knowing your cat would absolutely eat you if you were small enough always remember that i do youtube's this isn't another one of those giant kami affectionate cats is it can we just ask them not to molars?

02:26:37

Oh sure. I can do that. This is so much. Thank you. Dear, where is youtube at? Youtube is somewhere around here and now i won't actually kind of like found or they're pre-installed on the iphone. This little jade rabbit appears in the square next. To no way as the invisibility goes away.

02:27:06

Um, kind of salutes. No way steps through a jade green portal.

02:27:16

Hold it. We're gonna have a chat and it casts. I speak with birds. It gets me. Good the streets with all animals. It got permanently forever and then you see a rabbit talking to a cat on a bridge over and endless chasm under the ground. It's a, the perfect mid parable for any agent theme story.

02:27:48

Boom. Boom. Lip her lip. Meow.

02:27:58

It's exactly what cat sounds like. Can i ask why one of these? Goblet is 100 feet up but the other ones are only 40 feet up, uh, because i forgot to, okay. I was just like, this is you're really fucking with my sense of like, engineering and geometry.

02:28:21

So there on top of the tower which is 80 feet in the air, but i didn't set the levels for the top level. To the roof accurately. That one's 10 feet up. He's still on the bottom floor.

02:28:43

Which is completely my fault. Not isos. For once you could just blame piezone and we wouldn't know. Uh, i don't think i could for that one. They don't really make their stuff for the levels mod or get rocks. You just hear echo down through the cavern.

02:29:15

Happening with the movement difficulties sturdy. Do these the huts, the huts. The huts are on fire. Yeah, we flame strike them and firebolt. There are no more cuts. Yeah, this is 100 points blend. This one's perfectly fine. The it's that anime screen cap that magnus was talking about. Oh, gee was over here.

02:29:49

Flicking the blood off. His sword as these huts were burning to the ground. Uh, this had though has miraculously evaded. All forms of damage saved for a bit of blood. From the i've goblin pseudo chief that was in that hut. We all hide in the hut if we can't see them.

02:30:11

They're not there. Don't think that's how it works. Come on, but don't be such a coward, choko. Come on. All right. No, but seriously, we should probably, we should, we should consider taking cover in the kitchen for just 30 seconds here. Okay, no, you can just parry the rocks.

02:30:34

Okay, we're all parry the rocks. Sorry, we're going. Well, we're going without cheese plan. Everyone carry the rocks. Sounds good to me. Oh, excuse me sir. You have a moment to talk about our lord and savior sukio. He came back from the grave, you know? Oh, i don't want to rain on that parade.

02:30:59

But isn't that kind of shizuru and other people's deal that that happened? That that is sukio. You uneducated swine, i'm sorry, i didn't mean swine like that. Sir just hear from deep within the fortress first to bring you up to speeds. So here's the god of those who have died and come back and courtesy of his parable.

02:31:29

Yes, you do try again, but that's a complete story. Invoising Kewong, no, it's a whole thing. Oh, that was the person. Yes, i'm just imagining. Oh god, like dead panning this to you while like one hand is inside of it. Then just like trying to keep her chest in place.

02:31:52

Just like, these are feel like i'm dying. Um, oh boy, desna, i'm really gonna need your help. Now, i'm getting a lot out of this plus, too, to knowledge religion with zero ranks. I'm just one here. It makes you feel any better. I don't have any rocks. I just have a bunny.

02:32:15

That doesn't show up.

02:32:23

I want to hear entangled. Why are you fucking stopping and tangled there?

02:32:35

Uh, soya's eyes closed briefly as she casts this spell. Uh when they open again, you see the night sky where her eyes used to be, i and she expands as cost constellations. Start forming all along her body.

02:32:57

You hear excited clapping noises from somewhere generally in the direction of the world wound.

02:33:14

You know what i said that i was scared of coming. Oh,

02:33:28

Hold on, googling fatigued for pathfinder. You cannot run. You cannot charge negative 2 to strength and dexterity and don't get hit with anything else. That gives you fatigue, because that'll make you exhausted. And that one sucks. It's not great. It bucks.

02:34:04

OG pulls out. The terracotta talisman of a warrior figure and massages it. Gently and says, could you hook us up? We are about to fight some cats. I think there's the cats alone. They're fine problem. Uh, so this terracotta warrior kind of shakes a little. I know she's hand before expanding rapidly into this full samurai with the ornamental, makeup and headgear.

02:34:51

Your ownership.

02:34:56

Or a present.

02:35:06

Is a terrible and draws. It's stone katana and salutogi. Hell, yeah. And then with the rest of my actions, i'm going to go over here and just stand next to you too. So where where do you want to conjure? The terracotta warrior, because you get to conjure it anywhere as a like at like it's actually a spiritual ally.

02:35:33

Yeah. And i looked it up and it's 160 feet. So actually, let me let me just control z let's bust out the old measure tool.

02:35:51

There are a hundred feet up. You say they are. Do you want to drop them up there? I think i can. You certainly can you can just drop them right there and that's fine. Yeah, i think factory it works out pretty well for that. And you stay here immediately after he salutes.

02:36:12

He turns into mist and just shoots across the cavern and out from your view. Could you put him behind one? Oh, he had just five footstep behind it. Never mind. I was gonna say maybe, maybe go for a bowl rush. That'd be cool. Yeah, and then, like i said, we're gonna move over here with you, too.

02:36:35

Yeah, so it's it's a spiritual ally. Uh, not a summons. Ah, it does get aos but that's the important part. Yeah, and threatens and can flank. And just make sure his attack and everything are still set up. They a bit too high. There we go. Perfect. What is that surrounding ochi?

02:37:12

By the way, somebody made an animation and put it on an aura. Oh dear. What is that from? I didn't make that the terracotta warriam. Maybe i did. I don't know. It might have been kind of warrior did that. I think maybe my item that i did. Has an animation attached to it.

02:37:36

I don't remember making one. This doesn't look like a something i would make, uh, now there's no animation on the terracotta warrior. There is unrighteous might though. Oh, did i have you targeted when i cast it? Yeah, that sounds more like what you were talking about with the stars and all that?

02:37:58

Uh, no. I actually did not make a custom animation or i did. And i don't remember.

02:38:09

But there's a way to find out.

02:38:14

Right everybody. Go. Oh no.

02:38:27

Oh, okay. Never mind. I thought i had deleted everyone's tokens and then i realized i was on level like 80. So ghost, i could not see your tokens. Apparently jesus, let's scared the crap out of me.

02:38:51

Okay.

02:39:15

And because i didn't really read it until now, um, Spiritual all i can attack right away. Uh, yeah. So can spiritual weapon, we haven't actually left your turn. I was checking rights as mine. I would? Yeah, i was just reading up on it because i was, like, i should probably know since i decided to hit the button.

02:39:39

The very good spell. Uh, you you have full ownership over his token, you can go on down to him and use his attacks off of him. They're all set up and everything for you. They are okay.

02:39:56

It doesn't have vision. It looks like though. Oh,

02:40:18

He should know.

02:40:29

You'll need to select them to get his vision by the way. Yes. It should. Oh, does, it's built-in? You're right. Okay.

02:40:48

And he stabbed the hot goblin. I can't be right. There's no way. Well, i mean, we did get this in book three, it's one day 10 plus 2. So, Because the caster level. Oh, the talisman is six. Yeah. Okay, it was just a one on the damage roll. I was still he established a goblin.

02:41:21

Anything else for OOC. I think that's about it. Boom. Grayson. Oh christmas. It's got a move 60 feet forward and then we'll due to one. So this leopard in front of him.

02:41:49

Uh, using the, the perfect strike feet.

02:41:55

So, it'd be the first one because that's the highest.

02:42:01

Boom. Uh your arrow hits and the large feline. Kind of like have stumbles as it's running. Oh, not the kitty. Um, can i uh, dive nature? I have nature. Can i have a knowledge nature? Check on leopards, of course.

02:42:28

Uh, the main thing i'm looking for here, i don't know if i get this off of a nullish. Check is hit. I do. I think i could put one to sleep. Uh yes. Hit asking for the number of hit that is something you're allowed to do with rolling. Uh, they are fairly low hit by as far as the large cats go.

02:42:46

Uh, you do actually think you could put one to sleep, okay? Uh, not likely more than one though.

02:43:07

Wait, what is even the range on his sleep? Okay, medium. Okay.

02:43:30

You're kidding me. I i don't know what to say. It rolled a 19.

02:43:46

It looks leopard like shakes. Its ahead growling because it's in pain. And it was told to go hunting. Well, so much for diplomacy with a leopards. I mean because it's not an undead leopard. Yeah, well, now it's this leopard's fault that it and all of its friends have to die, but if you want to spare them, you have to charm them and then beat them in an opposed charisma.

02:44:20

Check. All right. I mean time there. Yeah. I'm not going to risk the party like trying to negotiate with something that is trying to kill us. Really not trying to actively kill us. If you serve it first, that's something else.

02:44:44

But okay, it's completely in opposition of what you did last week, what are you talking about? I shall dude, for goblin first before we talk to it. That's, that's not unfair. That's true. But i did open the, the combat with going up to the line of hobgoblin archers and say, hey maybe we could talk, what's out like, i waited until there was through magic through that, i waited until there was two left and that i approached one of them because they weren't a threaten anymore.

02:45:20

You're honor leading the witness. I know his face is basically pulling a, like, the amount of mental gymnastics. You must have to do, literally puts my own to shame. It's impressive. So we're not trying to kill the kitty. Please don't kill the cats.

02:45:44

I don't know what joke, just fall over laughing but we can't find funny. Just forward to this video.

02:45:57

Oh my god.

02:46:06

So this cat because it's a cat um doesn't follow her. Laughing it. Lays down and starts licking its front paws. While just the very end of its tail twitches.

02:46:23

Good enough. All right, this hobgoblin looks at the stone warrior. That has appeared from nowhere drugs as bow, which clutters, 100 feet to the ground beneath them. Boom. Drove his morning star and swings at the terracotta warrior, who is a spiritual ally and made entirely of force. So, when's the mace bounces off of him.

02:46:54

The goblin looks even more afraid and probably a bit confused. Boom. Boom. This one not realizing what's up? Yet is going to five foot step around.

02:47:24

I'm willing to bed to hop cock. I has an answer.

02:47:30

I have decided that the terracotta warrior's name is nendo endo because that's oh one of my favorite anime, that my favorite anime characters of all time. His name, lindo from spikyk.

02:47:51

I and he is going to try and bull runs the terracotta warrior off of the tower. Uh, and me.

02:48:06

And goes through the terracotta warrior those through the terracotta war here, like shit. Go see if it's about to happen in preemptively, winces. Do you see what's about to happen? Well, he sees the guy fall and like you of the impact.

02:48:29

Well, that is not as much as i was expected. I and the hobgoblin falls and you hear a crunch as he does. And,

02:48:50

All right lenient like a chain. Yeah, fall damage is so weird, dude. The idea that level one, you could fall five feet and die. And then at level six you can fall a hundred feet and walking off. You're supposed. This is a setting where the same people can also like teleport and create any plans, i think genuinely surviving a fall, is the least, like, you can do, that's a big pig.

02:49:26

That is a really big pig. So and as he comes around the corner, you see him eating this piglet? I with a great ax in one, in one hand, uh, writing, this enormous enormous dire bore,

02:49:56

I'm sorry, his seats did not fully transfer in.

02:50:09

Oh my god, we're gonna fight king baldwin on the bridge. But that's so what? That's so appropriate and puto futosu this, the this wine up car guy.

02:50:34

Is rugging and he comes out here. And he says, get away from my friends. My food, my two emergency foods and my son in that order. Yes. Actually uh, only gets to make one attack.

02:50:57

Bed bugs, i creation.

02:51:03

Oh, pretty sure. He hits you. Yeah, that seems like a lot. It's the only kind of a lot. The sbc needs to go away but that's still leaves it as a 37. That was almost almost a critical. This is like the first person i've ever seen. Even touch Grayson, it is true and he swings at that.

02:51:31

It doesn't hit very hard. Apparently, i mean grease. It takes damage all the time owls, i'm not actually turned on. That's why we have a way to knock out this bridge. All right? No, they are actually stone bridges. I put them in wrong, we are level 11. That's fairphone.

02:52:04

Complete. You very true? Uh, unlike you and and abby. So go ahead does not have stone shape. Perfect.

02:52:19

Boom. Head down. I do not have a good way of sending this guy over.

02:52:33

Yeah. That would be would be hilarious. I will repost the description for everyone. I won't one day, i'm gonna be our goddess.

02:52:51

My pdf viewer is having a connection. I'm gonna be hard cogay, uh, but he does not hit very hard because of rage, that's right.

02:53:08

Make sure he's two handing it here. My man is not too handling and power attacking. What are you doing? They're strong enough shatter that could maybe do it for a shadow like effect. He was eating a piglet. That's why made it. It is super gross. So like my mind immediately goes to like uh to Gandalf to you shall not pass.

02:53:41

Just tap the bridge and it explodes and i'm wondering what spell would be strong enough to do that, to destroy the hardness of a probably like, at least 10 foot, thick, stone bridge. They are made for large creatures. 20 foot stone bridge. Yeah, perfect places.

02:54:10

I mean the bridge that gandolfo was strong enough to hold the bell rock. Like so Gandalf was a 20th, level wizard. Okay, that's true. It's in the appendices. He was also actually like a god, yeah. Can i want there's a lot of Lord of the rings fun facts that people like to throw out.

02:54:38

But my favorite one is when saruman calls Gandalf burner. When he's like you didn't know the ring was there you smoked too much weed you fucking idiot. Yeah, it's pretty awesome. That's it. Though this leopard kind of sits down and just stares at youtube for it's turn since their apparently talking.

02:55:05

They do look at you. Oh g. And and licks its lips.

02:55:14

Yeah, i didn't think about this very well, no way. Put you not, it goes over here. We'll move action. Second move action. Picks up the other lockizashi that she dropped. There's like, so.

02:55:36

What is this guy? Just like a really big hub goblin or what. It's not actually large size at all. But he is a really big hobgoblin yet. He's a really big problem.

02:55:57

I kind of work with that.

02:56:07

We can look up.

02:56:15

And you know, your choice come play with my keyboard guys. Chilly in there, it's good. It's one's ears, twitch, it's tailed twitches. A little more frantically and like, advisors starting to that starter rounds thing. No, you're okay. I was just worried, just wanted to make sure that it sticks.

02:56:43

Okay, i was just gonna let him relax a little bit, you know. He's a little beans are cold. Just kind of rock. You can turn off the AC all wrong. I only keep his job boy by being have fun. Say, i love you. Mom. Okay, i love you. Mom ochie.

02:57:06

A rock lands next to you. I pair in.

02:57:17

You want to lose your component? No, it won't. There's no way a regular rock is breaking Mike asana. There is a few period, with a katana. We'll find out.

02:57:33

Why cats? No fight. Stupid cats.

02:57:43

Stupid, bunny. And tries to go up but can't because youtube isn't an enemy, you know? He can step over around youtube. There we go. It's gonna tell you you choose just inconvenient. If you is inconvenient and looks up annoyed at the giant looks over his glasses.

02:58:14

You really don't want to get in my way bub. Hot fucking rock. The youtube voice. That's beautiful.

02:58:33

So, this leopards just sort of nodding

02:58:44

That's super planking.

02:58:52

And then lunches on to the giant's leg, in that way, the cats do when they're really pissed at you. Oh, hell yeah, they scram, oh, murder cat. Do they scrim? No, not yet. He didn't actually hit with both of his claw attacks, but he was going to. Oh, i see.

02:59:13

Youtube's worked. You're referring to when they break with their black back legs, right? No scram. What's that thing? A scream, a scream scrum. Oh, snow leopards. Do make that weird chirping noise, don't they?

02:59:36

Big cats. Make a lot of really weird noises like really do thing. Really. Uh, i need a noises are hilarious. Queer. Vanishes from where she was and lands with a thunderous clash.

03:00:12

And bots that can't be right, it's not right because it's checking with our strength for some reason. But she still watched, oh, gee

03:00:29

Okay.

03:00:34

I don't think it requires any kind of action for the spiritual highlight to keep tacking, right? Just keeps doing it. Yeah, it's just on it. Some you have to move it with a swift but it just keeps attacking so spiritual owling didn't do that.

03:01:01

Poke both of those here. By the way, the one that tried to knock it off, the bridge was the one that it stabbed. So, it had every reason to assume it was solid.

03:01:16

Um, and then we'll go back to ochi the OG. I don't know what we want to do here. Do some stab, probably do some stuff.

03:01:34

Or hill giants. Evil. I am flanking. You are blinking.

03:01:49

Just gonna put that plus two in there.

03:01:54

Um, and you know what? Before we hit that button.

03:02:02

We'll hit that button on my challenge. This my cats and i will vanquish you large person.

03:02:17

A 21 is i don't like that. How can we make it higher? Well, the 21 hits.

03:02:27

So the first one would actually be a 36 because it's going to include the it definitely hit and then it does nine extra damage. Yeah i'm sorry it's not a 36. I added that to the attack rolling. Oh no i was right? Yeah, 36 damage. Yeah, i can't do math.

03:02:49

So this giant stroved with such confidence over this bridge walked right past the cats that were supposed to be on its side uh to have a cat jump and start trying to hobble it by tearing out. Its achilles tendon to ochi cutting up one side of its other leg and then part way down its other fling and starts yelling like what they why?

03:03:18

I think just completely dumbfounded. I think that's going to be my turn.

03:03:25

Grayson uh chris then is going to shoot at this huge boar uh point blank range.

03:04:00

Worth.

03:04:08

Boom. Boom.

03:04:15

Why didn't you auto die?

03:04:22

And that's it. Let's go back up so grayson riddles. This charging boar with arrows. And we can say this like thematically as it's happening you are firing these arrows into this borer and your fifth. Arrow is gonna bring it down. How do you want to do this? As this boar is running at you, uh, maybe does the the movie moment of like as it's charging, he hits many times.

03:04:55

And it uh it falls but it's momentum carries it forward, until it's snout like ends. Like an inches in front of him, does it just slides along the ground? Boom. That will also make him prone.

03:05:16

Shoko.

03:05:26

Um,

03:05:30

So heroism is just a buff against fear faces. It's not immune to fear, right?

03:05:39

Oh wait i wouldn't know he has heroism. I'm using meta knowledge. Uh, so um, yeah. We're gonna we're gonna see just that courageous, the swine cargo is.

03:06:02

Boom.

03:06:11

That's two for reaching, not very

03:06:20

So uh, shoko is surrounded by ghostly blue fox fire as he locks eyes with the swab kagay. And you see some of the fires start to flicker on him as he starts to freak out.

03:06:40

Uh and then i will use my move action to accentuate, his fear with a bartic performance will give everyone courage except for him and the other enemies, why isn't our courage a different thing. Now whatever.

03:07:03

Oh, it's because that right right? Yeah.

03:07:23

And then i'll end my term.

03:07:45

Uh, may go. Boom. It's gonna keep flying her high speed and she blasts. Like she used to Dragon Ball Z character, that's another real safe. He's got to make.

03:08:09

Scroll back, boop.

03:08:17

He is frightened now.

03:08:27

That's very unfortunate for him.

03:08:56

All righty. I mean i think oh no no that's there was all my ghost turns. So anything else from her? Oh right. Oh my god. I don't know why. I just suddenly thought it was yours. I did button. People with it by some warrior drops his bow. That tries to bore.

03:09:21

No, he's just saw what happened to his friend. He does on the other hand, move away, so the terracotta warrior gets inside of opportunity.

03:09:39

That is a myth. And,

03:09:52

It was still 100 feet up. I wish whatever this elevation glitch was would be fixed.

03:10:08

If you fill up on that bridge and runs across the bridge into a dark tunnel,

03:10:24

With the blossom warrior who's on the ground.

03:10:31

Double moves up weirdly provoking a million attack from coyote?

03:10:49

Oh, okay. I am just developing all sorts of new fears and phobias. As a result of being in this place, you know, governed comes running up to crazy koias. Massive hand just lash out with her star knife. And catch him. This windshield can provokes attacks of opportunities, from both Grayson and koya, but clear doesn't have a metric places.

03:11:24

He stands up. That's super hits and super hurts.

03:11:36

The effect is only once per round so he does not make another safe. He screams in pain, fear and agony.

03:11:51

Uh, sacrifices, his standard action.

03:11:58

It moves. 30 feet. Can't be right. Oh. Oh it is right because he is a land speed of 20 base, okay? So, 30 feet is right.

03:12:18

Where there's lots of warrior going to keep firing his arrows, like a boss. It's going to miss all of them, like a failure. Hmm. Yes, the, the the snow leopard is is noting sageally in in agreement, and then also on to the stone chain. Yeah, so this one thing that tookyo does imply, it's like freedom of sense of self and i feel like you've been getting that.

03:12:57

What would like nods? I was super thought it was gonna be like, doesn't that dude? Look, super delicious.

03:13:08

Not really what we're about here. No. Uh so this hill giant now with a second cat on him, screams out in, even more pain, he's barely hanging on. He's fighting the whole zoo. I team. Do you mind if i do a thing, heavy, do what you want? Not at all.

03:13:39

So so youtube kind of like plants their feet and

03:13:52

Youtube gets more muscle. What is happening? This is fucking rabbit master roshi.

03:14:07

I love my rabbit. Oh my god.

03:14:16

Oh, she's gonna do it by attack on this giant.

03:14:24

Um abby abby, you're welcome to do this. He was learned from being in the company of a ninja that you just need to hit some very select locations in order to deal with large targets. You did not just do that dude. Probably why? You see? Like, this is five rich people and uh,

03:14:55

I didn't know what i was doing when i let you have a jade hair with a silver and cheese statistics. Really, really, i did not regret the decision once at all. And now, i'm really enjoying you, too. Is an excellence. It's an excellent addition. It's very appreciate. Did the rabbit just kill the hill giant.

03:15:20

Yes, five. Oh my god. What's snowy doing? I'm fucking crying, run away.

03:15:42

Bulging to know. We've never seen this happen before, actually. No, it's just kind of impressed. Oh my grounds, the corner.

03:15:59

Oh my fucking to adjust their glasses, as they look at ochi. I told him not to mess with me if i had movement not on my turn. I would take a step back from youtube.

03:16:20

To a plus eight to strength. That's like 80 percent of oh, sheath strike score. Yeah. It's, it's literally it's more than what choko has just a total. It's

03:16:41

Ridiculous. So heavis is quiet, like what, you know, knowing is unsurprised by this. And the reason why she's unsurprised is, there's no way, but i have not envisioned that she's nearly fallen off of the fucking tree branch or the characters at some point. And literally you choose just kind of grabbed her just holding her because he, he would have to bite obviously.

03:17:05

So he's just holding her color. Something, she's just dangling q like a solid 30 seconds of screaming followed by. You can just be back and he's just got that look on his face too. Like like that pseudo grumpy. Like yeah, i did that. You choose like the redemption story of someone from watership down.

03:17:39

Oh my god. Oh, there's no way.

03:17:46

What's up? Where is gonna power attack?

03:17:53

Require going. I misses with the second one, but she hits with the first one.

03:18:04

Even with righteous mind. Koya is still a six-and-year-old boy. Very impressive, very terrifying.

03:18:20

Let's just go check real quick, so i don't remember land 60. Oh yeah, we're fatigued because we don't have haste or anyone. All right. Remember the swine kage is fleeing. He is infected bleeding from shoco. Okay. Well, i guess we'll go kill him. I guess. What is the duration on that fear?

03:18:48

I'm so far away from it. Oh um, one round per level. Yeah. Do the leopards. Try and kill me when i step past them. Nope, they are purring and licking their chops because they're about to eat that giant.

03:19:07

OT will finish walking over here.

03:19:13

I already have like a character in mind for like a sequel campaign. Like if we ever do scattered star or, or, um, return of the room, always like something that takes place after this. I'm absolutely rolling up with mien as a ranger with a snow leopard pet. I love it.

03:19:37

We're gonna try and faint. Oh, that is if he didn't if he wasn't immediately riddled with errors by shelelu upon exiting the building, i don't think that. That does it does that faint the hardcage? Uh, it does not didn't think so, but that's okay. Or he is a fighter barbarian is what exactly kind of nerf is frightened?

03:20:06

What does it like diva? So a friend creature, fleas from the source of its fear, as best as it can. If unable to flee, it will fight a friend's creature. Takes a minus two penalty on all attack rolls saving throws skill, checks and ability, checks frightening creature can use special abilities, including spells, deplete, and deep.

03:20:23

The creature must use such means. If it's the only way to escape frighten is like shaken. Except with the creature, must flee if possible panicked as a more extreme state of fear. Well, if he lives through shoco's turn, we're gonna see what panic looks like.

03:20:42

Uh, luckily, it has now become unsafe for him to flee.

03:20:51

Is that because i hit or because i swung it. Oh, because you're there and you threatened him. Now.

03:21:11

You do hit and cut quite deeply into him though. Good. Good, good. A little raven head pokes out of your familiar pouch, let the heat flow through you.

03:21:32

Grayson uh, crystal will this kind of keep shooting at the hot car day?

03:21:47

Boom. Boom, actually shouldn't say keep shooting. It's the first time. He's attacking keep shooting, comment at the hop car game.

03:22:01

No, your volume arrows. Bring him down.

03:22:08

Oh, wait, actually the last one missed them. He's still alive. No, he's not. I like he's down. How would you like to do this? The last one misses because he's not standing anymore. Uh maybe he had his uh his back to to Grayson because he was running away very much so and even though he kind of was turning towards uchi it's just arrows.

03:22:33

Appearing in his back.

03:22:37

Those you get up next to the the swine, pop car game, the porky slime, the porky slide and he becomes fucking quillboard, it falls over dead right in front of you. Uh because as soon as that last arrow hits and he's a negative one. He drops it, right? And then submits to sudden barbarian death syndrome.

03:23:03

That is syndrome before any barbarians and i'm aware of this terrible affliction. It's so yeah. He dead dead. Oh i skip show co, excuse me. Yeah. Well, hello. Uh, i was just like, fuck shoko. This whole combat is my fault.

03:23:30

You actually just made the last bit of this combat, extraordinarily easy. So, i can imagine that this would be much worse if we had the violet Dominican fine space. Uh, actually it would have been uh, because on the second floor where you would have nowhere to go, he could just to get it all of you with his ridiculous.

03:23:58

Ridiculous plus one thundering. Great x for which he has improved critical. That's what i was expecting. Yeah. Yeah, i was real worried about this fight because of how often i crit plus 47 damage which is also why i would have been totally. I have no issues with the the frightened thing this time around.

03:24:27

Like, you know, i probably would have killed one of you and this fight if that hadn't happened.

03:24:35

Um, don't don't like the giant throwing rocks of people. Uh, door, am i listen to

03:24:54

Do not try and acrobatics the bottomless chasm.

03:25:03

Too far away from that. Do it do. So, i'm gonna go with a silent range, giving him the sheave. And i'm going to build basically like i'm gonna make a wall of stone pop up in between the giant and us. That's that's cool. That's a good one. You could also do like 10 snow leopards and it would probably run away.

03:25:34

It's probably, it just watch a spread to get mauled and snow leopards is funnier. We're doing. We're doing an arby's said. A wall of stone. A wall of snow leopards. Yes, violently staring him down. I'm sorry, i'll turn this campaign into just this the hobokage agent pillows at these snow leopards and they're forms.

03:26:09

Vibrates jesus.

03:26:17

I know illusion.

03:26:25

All right, bundt go did that change? Just say it knows illusions to be far. We did see one that threw off course, changed the light. So obviously know i wanted to things about magic, do they? Are they speaking in common? The giant is. Yes. Okay. The other one was too.

03:26:45

Yeah, yeah. Okay. Raise that earlier. But it's like. So who knows this? No way. Like, i think she's the only one who speaks giant to be fair. They're common is peon, so yeah.

03:27:02

He he has three hp left. Another flurry of energy blasts. Uh, this guy takes off at a full run, 200 feet down this tunnel and is out of combat.

03:27:28

Wall evolutionary. Snow leopards. Why are you liking? I think i might have i might have shot you in the foot on that one. If it was a wall stone he'd been like that makes sense of wall. Snow leopard is like, wait a minute that not right?

03:27:51

Uh, this guy actually connects with koya but it only rolled one of his attacks. Okay. So just the second one, which is a miss and then grace in, you will get the shield slam and the bull rush but he misses anyways.

03:28:14

That's why hub cogay is dead since grace and killed the previous home. Yes, he is now the hubcake.

03:28:33

Congratulations, need. I made, don't know.

03:28:40

Uh, what what are you saying? Nope. That's right. He doesn't he does not speak to. Yeah. Just no way, no way be like well first doctors, please stop being so close to me. Aggressive were you in that square? Didn't even know you were there. Yeah, i'm getting better at that.

03:29:11

See no way is he really is? It's quite wait. Excuse me. She really is. No way is all of our imaginary friend and youtube is her imaginary friend. We all just talked to her when no one's there. See what's actually happening is that i actually died and this is just like an ephemeral image from the inferior.

03:29:35

Plane material, hallucinating simultaneously. Yeah, no way. I just thought up your new official title. The jade ghost. Oh yes says i'll make oh why am i so tired? Fuck you shoko.

03:29:55

Genuinely awful. Isn't it don't worry always slices the sky in the drugs. She goes like don't worry guys. I'll fix it in the moment. I was gonna ask, how do you want to do this? But yeah, the first one, he had three hp lab. All right. Now that um, it's kind of alerts across the way, isn't it?

03:30:27

Oh invisible. Thumbs up. Thank you.

03:30:38

Is giant and a number of application, this? Yeah, this leopard is just sitting there now, it's ears. They're like, twitching and it's kind of panting a little bit and it's pause or twitching at something, but it's just doing those like, little kitty happy movements, because it's still under the effects of hideous.

03:31:03

Laughter. It's terribly boy. How do we deal with you? He's just gonna keep vibing there.

03:31:17

No bad illusions. Bunk runs into something. Uh, runs right past the way. There's really right over? Right over joy. No way. I'm sorry for what you witness you know where to aim. That's that's that. That giant is only wearing a loin cloth. No, it casually sidesteps that before any of you death, i think that she would but death noise.

03:31:51

Mark, click look. I'm loops because what we did was dad. Remember, it's a little lots of things to be. Oh, kitty real. No, i just kind of like suck, you know, casually side steps. Put circuit in her. Fuck is actually out and just like last ranch is entire cap.

03:32:19

Just straight down to the tendon. Like boom. Boom. So, minus 3 that also means he's second uh, as yeah, his leg opens up unfortunately for him. It also means he didn't get to charge because the technically had to pass through noise space, so his charge kind of gets interrupted a little bit, so he won't get the bonus on this assault, they can go on.

03:32:57

I seem to be lagging.

03:33:01

So are we all on board with replacing scagney with three snow leopards? There's nothing that says i'm a baller and i'm supposed to be the emperor then rolling up with three snow leopards. That's fair. Jason, uh, that club barely misses you if he had not been sickened. He would have hit perfect.

03:33:30

Perfect. Um, you're dead. You can go away.

03:33:38

Uh and these two snow leopards follow upon the dead giant who was not technically dead before, but very much is now

03:33:54

The cat said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:34:04

Come on. Quiet steps through a portal of light.

03:34:16

So i just melts when you're gonna do that. I just remember this. Let me thanks to know. It was a thud. I knew where you were. I knew where you were dear.

03:34:36

Make me feel better.

03:34:42

Okay, we can't five footstep, sadly. So, we're gonna do stab from

03:34:59

Let's just get that out of the way. Shall we? Does that get me where i need to go? Uh, yes. Pretty much wherever you want to go. I would like to go about here.

03:35:19

Stab the incoming and working on it. You get those two four flanking.

03:35:41

Poke that is a bit more than a poke, sir. It's a very aggressive poke is a very aggressive poke. He is still standing though. They have a lot of HP. Yes we do. And so that's gonna be oh, she's turn bringing us into Grayson,

03:36:05

Target the hobgoblin. That's up on the walls. Oh, i'm so sorry. Can i move this spiritual ally in poke the goblin? Yes, that's fine. One moment. Grayson. Oh, and that'll be my swift action to move him. Actually that's good. Burning up those actions.

03:36:31

Okay, poke done.

03:36:37

Please resume prison. Whoa, that was a big.

03:36:47

So that was, that's nice. Yeah, nine on a d10.

03:37:00

Oh, jesus.

03:37:04

Boom.

03:37:09

Critical.

03:37:22

Uh, go through. Oh there he goes. It just flagged. All right, so your third arrow with a 60 point, critical damage killed him. All right. Then the further of this would be against the hill giant. And it does take them both. How do you want to do this? Uh, i mean based by the angle it looks like maybe he would be shooting at the hill giant's head, but the arrows are going past it up into the hobgoblin.

03:37:55

And then with the last two, he just the very slight dip. In his hand towards the the giants face. Very nice like me. Yeah, he's got nothing on him so i don't have to feel bad for this. Uh as the hot goblin, takes those two less arrows. He falls forward after a brief rock falling into the chasm below.

03:38:25

Uh, you hear his body said, several times against the rock wall. Then several times more several times more. As he just hits it back and forth 400s of feet before you finally hit it here. His body thuds somewhere, at least 160 feet below you.

03:38:56

Uh well, good news everyone. I think is gone fabric on the last round of combat. Cool. I finally feel fits enough to throw for you for doing that. What? It's towards the side of the voice. No, no. You see you see? No. I kind of like up here and then just kind of points over to YouTube.

03:39:25

Just like can you just like threatened to throw him off the cliff or something? Me threaten. So go. Look at youtube with unbridled fear. I don't make friends. I make promises. Oh my god, let's go retreats behind Omega.

03:39:48

I love about Robert. So, as you guys are talking, you see the, the wall of snow leopards, the sentence not new sentences, new sentence.

03:40:07

Not they they turned somewhat misty as they turn and look in your direction and then you, you see the the fox fire. That shoko's magic is composed of that dark purplish blue hue. I and then their eyes open again. Burning green. As they look at all of you.

03:40:36

And then they vanish filco. Turn that off with me. I didn't do that circle looks genuinely worried not like, oh, afraid, like with you two, what? But the i think that wasn't me.

03:41:02

Where is ochi at? It's a great question. Oh, i accidentally delete. Oh she. When i was deleting the cats, i'm right there. I forgot where i was ignoring here. Unnamed narrator god.

03:41:24

And suddenly 16 snow leopards, apparate out of nothing and kill ochi and dragon away. So we we're gonna have a problem with this no leopards or they are they quite happy to just, i don't know. Continue dealing with the oppression of their overlords. Oh, no. They've agreed to come with us, as long as we'll feed them and treat them better than he did.

03:41:48

Fuck. Yes. Oh, she immediately walks over it starts trying to offer one food and it starts to open his familiars actual please. Don't make sure that they understand not to eat the large birds. That one is useful. Oh she maybe give them some time. They don't need to go in there.

03:42:09

Oh, she's like movements. Oh cheese shoulders. Drop a little bit and really you need to let your bird out more often, man. He closes the familiar, satchel the bird was like halfway out like, yeah, it's ongoing case of animals going on and over inventory. It's somewhere between known if you want to stand like no, i just looks at that and then kind of cautiously looks over to like it.

03:42:41

It's somewhere between figure something with this. It's somewhere between like an aspca like warning infomercial and like that dude who like starts with like a paper clip and is like trying to trade his way up to a lamborghini.

03:43:00

Uh, if everyone would just gather up please, uh your terracotta warrior will return to his form.

03:43:12

Yeah, see i learned from grace and grayson has stuff lust. And, oh, this is i'm gonna stop the sentence there. No, no. That's, that's a good phrasing for it. I think probably parkours grows down.

03:43:35

I was going to finish it by saying, oh, g has pet lust, but i didn't think it sounded right. As i thought about it. Yeah, that's fair. No, i think i think there's already a word for that. It's not a good one.

03:43:53

Don't talk greedy. Don't know. You, you're funny.

03:44:02

Specifically credit forgot what? The hill giants. Were we are seven.

03:44:14

My face hurts. This has been a fantastic combat man. This combat would have dragged on so badly if we weren't being funny about it. Well, every shoco, like, he really expediated that a lot of it just like border collie and all of the goblets into one spot and then we just flame strike the fuck out of their village.

03:44:38

Like a third world country that has oil. All right. So this this will technically be in the first floor of the keep. When you guys go in there this is the the horde of the two giants. So you don't have this part. Yes. Because you're doing the hobgoblins and the shogun first, because they're right there.

03:45:02

Okay. So, the swine hopkake actually held some really fantastic things that he didn't really get to use. He has a potion of tier series wounds a plus two. Oh your roy a plus. Yeah, that plus one thundering. Great ax. A dagger with a gold hilt worth 400 gold masterwork composite longbow with a plus four strength.

03:45:31

Bonus, not really useful for grayson who has an adaptable one. There's this point, uh but he does have 20 arrows. A belt of giant strength plus four i shoko cloak of resistance plus one not even. Ironically just yeah, uh, cloco versus plus one. Unfortunately made from the skin of 47.

03:45:54

Piglets she's fucking christ. Oh my gosh, i'm going through this. No, he's just gonna be like fucking chanted that.

03:46:09

After some identification, a gingasa of the fortunate soldier, which is where to god, it comes from, you shouldn't be surprised. Exactly. I thought i told it, i told that everyone early on in my games don't use crafting for everything. I thought it was AP agnostic. I literally looked, i was like if it's in one, it has to be in this one because i was gonna wait and hear it.

03:46:37

Is it supposed to put printed in this? Like a reprinted really? When it comes. Yeah. I was like, yeah, that's what i thought. I saw. It was one of the ultimates and i was like, oh, okay, i'll go get it then because it's not going to pop up. So a bronze rice bowl worth 15 gold and it carved horn box with six spindles inside that are worth 100 gold to each and a horn of libation worth 75.

03:47:05

He offered 22 gold in his bag. His little pouch. I'm gonna i'm gonna put some most of the stuff but not everything. What do you think he was trading with? Why would they need your currency? Someone who really likes bacon. I don't think it was them that we're carrying the currency.

03:47:26

I imagine, it was probably them and no way and their victims. She just had to put it in writing made from the skin of 47. Piglets, i didn't do it. They did. It's not my fault. She eats subscribed. Uh, each of the withered blossom. Warriors also has a potion of cure serious.

03:47:47

Wounds a set of mass mark domaru, a mess work, heavy, wooden shield. Mess work can puzzle longbow with 20 arrows and masterwork morning stars. Are we collecting the mundane gear as well? Uh the masterwork stuff. Yes, all of their stuff is masterwork. These problems are well, i think that's the same equipment.

03:48:09

The ones we had in previous rooms were having yes. Okay. How many more of them bump. So it is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven eight. Yes. No 8 9 10 11. Because three i came out with him as well. Okay, if so weirdly the same number, how many i mean?

03:48:37

So like the initial thought as adventures is sell these for money. But then my thought is we're gonna be building more or less an army. That's that's a thought. You might want to voice because no one else be thinking it right now. Um, uh shuka will say, do you think that when we get some minkai and we have to stage whatever revolution, it'll take to put to knock the big jolly green asshole off his throne?

03:49:12

No, we could use this equipment instead of selling it grace and shoots showco. Seven times. Just bullet back. Still count Grayson stops putting stuff in a bag of holding. Picks up his bows. Just out of curio. Actually frequent minute question. You're a darrent of um, uh, indeed. Once i wore his thoughts on materialism, um, it classes with their thoughts on being the best that you can be.

03:50:00

Wow, that was really well. Oh, jeez. Slack. John. She's not even saying it like sassy. It's a genuine like question. No, he's fully slacked. I just but there are some high priests of erori that are slack jaw too. Like, on the other side of of galaria, like what a point that is?

03:50:22

Yeah, said well you want me to be the best archer in the world with no fucking bow? Like come on. No, no look. Oh, my honey wasn't always with a massive stick of her ass. She wasn't! She understood how those practices were many of them. Take vows of, what was it called, poverty.

03:50:48

I don't know it, sure. But how do i know that? Right. My idiot. Brother was a monk.

03:51:02

Um, amigo realizes she says that out loud and kind of just shuts her mouth

03:51:12

But no, i'm just curious. It's dying offers an interesting. I trans to look at things again. Would the people who have lived in horizia over the past few decades know who will make it was talking about. Yes. Pseudo, who was also a zen archer monk, who actually was kind of driven crazy by his family, who locked him up in an insane asylum to basically punish his existence because he was had out of wedlock.

03:51:45

Good old kaijutsu family nonsense, man. Yeah, so i want to will be fair. He also then i really hate that this happened in game of thrones. Uh, so he, he took his father to their own glassworks and poured, molten glass on him years before Game of Thrones came out, by the way, okay?

03:52:13

When you when you were, when you opened with i hate Game of Thrones, i was expecting a very different sentence out of you, okay? That's sick. I was like i was about my eyes were fucking biggest sauces. But wow, he did not. It was not like that with a makeup.

03:52:32

No, it was not a, i have a thing for my sister. Well, it sort of was actually that's why he kidnapped her, but i'm gonna run you through that ap. I can't give you spoilers for it. It's all happens in the very first book. Yeah. Okay, more on the riffs on stuff left, while this stuff is going on here.

03:52:49

I think that we've got this down to such a system that like, oh, gee is like, helping sort the stuff into piles, so we can get it accurate count, because he was like a scribe by trade. He's got like a little clipboard at this point and grayson's got the abacus and they're, like, going around, you know what I mean?

03:53:06

Because at this point, we're pulling in like tens of thousands of gold pieces worth of stuff like all, you're an 11th level party that i've been doing this together now for a year and a half. Yeah, we just got tired of like the bad accounting and we're like fully like we have a cloud excel spreadsheet.

03:53:23

You know what i mean, everyone's really good at like, the basic multiplication and stuff now and percentages. And yeah, what the current market value of things is? So what are the rules in minkai like of about a? Because whether or not we whether or not Shopko says we should sell the items into them into raw gold or we should outfit the resistance.

03:53:49

We find in mean kai with them. Depends on whether or not like the the region has done the whole. Was it was, it was it? The edo period, we're carrying swords was outlawed. Fuck, what was it? God damn it. I knew this one. It was before the i mean it was before the mediast of the restoration that is the word i was looking for the Meiji restoration.

03:54:14

Yeah and they they have done something, very similar samurai who are loyal to the four divine families have been outlawed and kind of by proxy goes the carrying of the katana because even in minkai as well if you're carrying katana you're expected to be able to samurai class which is why.

03:54:34

Oh, she had his cool stick, it was both his only weapon and like a mark of shame then. Yeah, people loyal to the jade regions are expected to have their weapons, and you can get away with it, uh, but they will absolutely use it as an excuse to put you in a black bag and steal you away and arrest you.

03:55:00

I want i don't know if i'm like, i'm trying to make that in character, so that that's a lot of character note that we have for OG is just that he like takes note of that. It's like if that's said out loud and character, he says, yes, that's why i was carrying the weapon i had before.

03:55:15

Uh, they're the ones that i carry. Now, you know what i mean?

03:55:23

But if we're having a serious discussion about whether to keep or to sell stuff and possible funding of a rebellion army, i think it's more suiting like the 10 sets of armor and weapons aren't going to outfit and like it's going to be a negligible amount of people that we're going to be able to equip in reality.

03:55:46

If we do want to have like our little band, we should make sure our little band looks like, you know, royal prestigious and like a homecoming sort of party. And like really put on airs, when we get there and anybody that we hired needs to not just be like a fucking peasant rabble but like, you know, the people putting on this returning hero and her.

03:56:11

What's the cool everybody? Supports them, well entourage. Yeah, man. That's a word omega says that. She's like scratching one of the snow leopard's heads. Yeah, that's why the snow leopards are necessary. Og says very loudly and quickly at the end.

03:56:32

Shouldn't we then be looking for these samurai that are still loyal to my family's house? They would be the ones most likely to rebel. Wouldn't they? Yes, we would need to get the word out, and that's what i think we need the money. Everything comes down to money. Unfortunately that's the sort of thing that we need to be mindful of is how we can spread the word.

03:56:54

Well we know there's no place any ways here in the forest of spirits that we're likely to unload. All of this when you're going to need to get into mankai one way or another. So maybe we put a pin in this until we get back out of here. Yeah.

03:57:07

Yes it's just the question was raised. So i wanted to point it's a good question. I definitely think we should. We should think about it because i haven't i don't think i've really understood until this moment that we are trying to overthrow. What is currently known as the right bull government of a country that i haven't even set foot in yet.

03:57:30

So, i'm going to need a minute to say with that. You omega says, show, go looks at our mako and it's like, did i not try to stress to you? That's what you were doing when inversia, okay. There's something that you guys have to understand about a makeo that i don't think you've been picking up on a mako, is 22 years old 23?

03:57:59

Now actually, to be fair, actually, maybe 24. It's been about a year and a half with an intelligence of 12 and the wisdom of eight. Oh, jesus. I get that. I get that. And that's why i know is half laughing at this, which is why i have been armpiting her as that.

03:58:20

Oh, gee is good, but she has a charisma of 20. Yeah. So as we're like turning over these awesome blossom goblin corpses looking for their valuables talking about, oh, yeah, we're gonna have to have the army to overthrow this other army. It's, um, after we've committed fucking war crimes, why?

03:58:41

I don't realize how far, like, how how long is this conversation, been going? Because i meant to bring up something you minutes. Oh, no. Oh then show goes eyes. Go, why did he realize it? Wait a minute. There were the four. Some of them ran away, it's probably what down deeper to warn odd.

03:59:01

Probably too late. Huh. Oh yeah, it's fine. Choco, don't worry. Well well if we have to find a rebellion then we'll fund it with our own money. Greyson says, as he's taking his belt of strength, plus too often putting on the uh, anybody need this, by the way. He holds up his old bill fail raises the hands.

03:59:24

I mean, well, i mean show go to. I suppose i can do that thing. Already has a belt. Yes, he has a tech spell. I'll take it unless no way wants it or ochi OT. Do you want to build graceen will be working on my bell to get shortly that i already have?

03:59:47

Excellent. Will he now? Okay, so someone was taking the past two belt so i can just remove it for this. Hey, coyote will wear it for now at the very least sure.

04:00:06

Currently and you have it on your sheet like kitties, uh i had it. I switched that to a plus four. Oh okay. I will just copy that one and change it then.

04:00:21

Start using this. It's not about me trying to get as much money as possible. It's it's about not letting this stuff go to waste. I mean, who, who really is gonna come down here afterwards? Like, otherwise this stuff is just laying here. Helping no one. Oh yeah. We're gonna bring it all with us.

04:00:40

Don't worry. Oh yeah, there's no reason to leave it, especially for funding or rebellion. Well, what did versus think i was, is, was great to thinking i would suggesting that, we, we can't take the stuff with us. I'll make a look at the, the non-masterwork weapons of the regular hobgoblin's.

04:00:59

Maybe not all of it but those ones, the well-made ones. Oh no, no, she'll go. It was to, it was to no ways implication or insinuating to me, that might be just a bit greedy on everything. Oh, i don't think it's anything to do with your grade. I'm just curious as to how you reconcile the fact that you're supposed to be in a deer to someone who believes in physical protection, i mean, i am look how much buffer my uh my muscles are now.

04:01:35

Oh, that's three using the weights and knowledge of enough, your own techniques. When it comes to things you need i suppose. But it's simple arithmetic. No way. He kills people using hard work and then takes the money and makes himself even stronger. Two plus two equals four by that logic.

04:01:57

Then i should she's very clearly about to say something along the lines of like i should ninja your ass and your sleep and probably sell you off to the jade region and then very purposefully keeps her mouth fucking shucks. This is not hard to read by the way. Well this conversation is happening.

04:02:21

You see youtube kind of like relax and turned back into a normal bunny. Jesus, get back here. No, i want to take back my my riff on that one. I need to work on being more of she like uh it doesn't change the fact that we're gonna have to do this whether the monk not the cleric is serving his god in a way that we think is applicable.

04:02:59

Oh,

04:03:03

I'm sorry.

04:03:08

Why is this restricting site? It's literally set to restrict none.

04:03:17

Look over the edge of the bridge. Uh, how far do you think this goes down? Yes.

04:03:32

You should go. Yes. Do we have a way to look? No, what can't you climb down there? It looks at you not have fucking time. Unless of course, princess here wants to tell me the game for myself off a cliff 400 feet. Why would i ever do that? Um, i mean i'll go.

04:03:57

Didn't you do it to save shoka? One time fucking damage. You just like you're not going anywhere. We're not doing this dance again though. Clea actually goes so far out of range that her light is no longer showing up here. It comes back as coya. The white and clips.

04:04:20

It's clear the white she this is when we find out the real twist of the jade regent ap, which is that coya was does not the whole time and then she reappears by stepping through another, one of those portals. I there's a few bodies and have goblins down there and mushrooms.

04:04:39

Lots of mushrooms and stuff. I don't want to talk about what a wonderful idea about absolutely font for my imagination. Could we please go back to like one more joke grace and said stuff? And then what you thought of the fucking edge. Just fine. I'm done. Um, this. Hey, no way.

04:05:10

Uh, do you want the leopards to come with us or you want me to like, and we, how are we getting them out of here? There wasn't a way to climb them out. Oh, g starts to open. Open his satchel again or not. God damn we'll find a well, we'll let down like uh, like, like a rope letter or something.

04:05:29

Once we once we leave, i don't really think about all the necessary. Oh, i can just once food. She's like like partying leopard on the head and then just you see the other hand point pointedly behind. I just like, oh yeah, i sort of raises her hands. I think actually after we remove the the chemo on, i'll be able to teleport us out.

04:05:57

Uh, it's the the body of the large bore still. Here it is. Yes. Uh, do you uh, do you want a regular bore? You want me to cut some flanks off it for them to eat, that would probably keep them occupied while we explore the rest. Is that what you want?

04:06:17

Is that what you want for your kid again? Just immediately start to something uh crescent starts kicking large chunks of meat off the deadbore uh the three cats will sit and watch grayson while he works. And yeah, they're just gonna hang out with this fucking board. Now until you guys come back, you guys are coming back.

04:06:42

Charcoal will go off. It's morning a little bit. You'll look around the kitchen. Boom. I actually get to read something from the book. Yeah hopefully sink fire pit burns in the middle of this chamber. Which smells a blood sweat and misery, several dirty workbenches stand around the. Around the pit.

04:07:06

There's nothing else in here except questionable meat that has been crudely sluttered and smoked by hanging it on metal hooks above the firing pits. Uh, how do we describe this? Oh, okay. The hop goblin's food is prepared in this chamber, primarily pork human rats stew. Made from the rather revolting, fun guy that grow in the cavern outside and slaves, captures from the forest above much of the fruit of the food.

04:07:35

Here is edible if revolting the chamber is crammed with cooking utensils most of which are bent and rusted. So, you're looking at a kitchen full of potentially, humanoid food and tetanus.

04:07:52

Uh, i'm holding out for that bowl of noodles. I was promised so pass. I guess so cold, we were promise. But out the fire. Uh, other than that, don't really have much. I can do here unless there's, like anyone like the any of the food is still alive. I don't think there's anything i could do in here.

04:08:21

Did that forego wandering up into the darkness? Blame himself, of course.

04:08:31

To see show. Go walk out with the, with those go off. Wrapped around his nose. Well, i get some back because as you're walking out, shoco, uh, your vision goes black. You guys see the light gets snipped out from the opening in the cave over there. She'll go shoko, choco.

04:09:05

Jugo, you're here.

04:09:17

Smell you.

04:09:24

Where are the voices coming from inside my head or from a direction bither but then your vision clears and you're sending back in the kitchen again or you never left the kitchen? Your little unsure. It's the ghosts of the slave cooks, that you flame striked.

04:09:57

Oh sorry. I will unpause the game, but i got bowl of noodles and fries who promised you? This bowl of noodles. Uh, believe you did before it became i don't remember it. Promising, you'll bold noodles. No, but you did comes to take me to dinner that i did.

04:10:23

Right, i promise to get you good noodles because you couldn't find any noodles in agonhei. What can i say? I'm a fan of nudes just face palms.

04:10:40

You, you see the doofiest. Like grin that you've ever seen not nice. It's like i got that one belong. So you know what noise first, uh, chat in the game? Origin group chat has to be now, right? Please.

04:11:03

Uh, stucco walks back. Um, sort of looking blankly ahead gets up to the rest of you does not just not go near the caps use. He is someone cautious about the giant death penis. Um, so you go stay next to the giant death button circle, just not step out onto the bridges.

04:11:30

Uh, kitchen salted kitchens haunted. Uh, the kitchen's haunted. I went in there. Oh, there's a bunch of, well, they were cooking people on there for one. I think that was obvious. Uh, but then the lights went out and i heard a voice fouling me, that it knew i was here and analyze went back on.

04:11:57

Well, i mean you did kind of play very loudly. I think happened. The fucking forgot knows. We're here, this didn't feel like a hunting to you, shoko, you're a dirge bar. You know what the presence of a ghost feels like this. Felt more, this book felt more like one of your own people's power.

04:12:25

Okay, well, maybe it wasn't a ghost. Maybe it was some formable magic communication and enchantment illusion, something like that. Um, spirits are talking to you, or someone is communicating to you, through them soca shruggs. He'll throw on a detect magic and look at himself to see if he's been cursed by something.

04:12:50

Nope, you sent a lot of magic though, around you. So,

04:12:58

There's a lot going on. I mean i seem to be fine.

04:13:19

Stop. You guys gonna carry on now? Just what? We're checking the beauty, you know, enjoy a little bit. I'd be great to finish gracious finishes. Butchering the board for the kitties uh likely with plenty to take back to your caravan as well. It was a big ass bore that's like free range too.

04:13:39

I bet you he ate nothing but like, organically fertilized mushrooms, you know. Yeah. Gross. I hit it. No. So now that you guys are over here with light on it, butos keep a stone keeps sits on an outcropping of rock in the belly of the huge cavern. Several of its walls have clearly seen better days.

04:14:05

The structure sags in places and heaps of rubble line that keeps flank from the building's roof, which almost touches the ceiling of the caverna stone bridge. Arkus across to a precarious, precarious rocking, elk crop, high above the cavern floor.

04:14:25

Uh, the board's name by the way, was tungkatsu?

04:14:33

Oh, excuse me. I almost missed something. The saddle on the bore is huge and ornate with a leather base and lacquer overlay set with small bloodstones and is worth 850 gold pieces. Uh, and each of the leopards is actually wearing a color that are inlaid with gold and worth 75 gold pieces.

04:14:57

See, this one's talking about dude. The gold colored snow leopard entourage. Can't be beat there. Is they also have chains, guys. They also have fucking blinged out. Chains. I'm going to assume that the collars and chains i should just leave off the loop. Yes, absolutely. You should leave them off a little bit of other perfectly fine.

04:15:22

What's wrong with having fruits? Murder kitties. We're just gonna have to keep them fed and well socialized. So they don't murder. People circle keeps a wide birth. Oh, ants are very intelligent. Once i tell them who they're not allowed to eat. So likely listen to me. Youtube looks at the cats.

04:15:49

They all. Look at you too. Look back at the board. You two never stops. Looking at them.

04:16:03

I mean if you if you type in mountain, lion versus fox, you'll see how that usually goes. So it will go terribly for you. That is fine. Given our composition. We've got um let's see, a fox a bird with another bird. Ah, an hour of firing rock a literal dead one.

04:16:29

Here's ground two perfectly normal people, frankly. So, oh, greyson's inside. Okay, uh so there's the cape here with i guess we're climbing the key. I was going to say, there was another door that i missed. Bump up a bomb. There's a door. There's no, it just climbing the side of the building by the edge.

04:16:55

Yeah, there's a door by the bridge.

04:17:02

We can see what's on the keys first though. Uh, you have to go through the keep and up its stairs to get to the bridge. What am i? Just didn't inclined the worms. Well, you can do that. So the keep is the way forward. Yes, then let's let's head back and not not leave that door unopened.

04:17:22

Okay. So the ground floor, this keep is squalid and foul. A little more than a stye for swines shogun's. Precious pigs three. Uh three iron cages and a wood install fill. The rest of the chamber, both of the cages, and the soldiers are fairly well rotted though and held closed by simple latches.

04:17:43

Usually odor seeps through the stone floor to the floor above, you know, the whole way. Okay, no. Never mind. There's nothing there. Uh, well look gross. I like oh, did they need this much detail? The floor is covered in an unpleasant mix of filth and rolling piggies. This layer is three feet deep and slippery.

04:18:05

The entire floor is considered difficult to rain. There are eight more. Piglets rolling around the inside. This room i'm suddenly i feel justified and just climbing up. All right. Greyson watches ochi to see if ochi is going to like put the piglets in his bag or no.

04:18:29

Their pigs. I think they'll be fine here until we come back. Maybe close the door so the snow leopards. Don't eat them. Do we want to take the pigs with us? They're babies.

04:18:48

A piglet. You cannot evade grants. Recent isn't gonna stop him curious. If it was, it was gonna do it or not. We just want to observe an uchi. Even catch the piglet in difficult, terrain. Do you have what it takes? Roll me out, cmbiochi. Englands are fast fuckers, especially in sloth.

04:19:18

Oh wow. That's an acrobatics change. Thank you. Oh, but it's the same thing. It's pretty much you roll the 17 as well. I so you hear and those people to because there's a difficult to reign to catch the well no one may see your sleight of hand that you grabbing a piglet, immediately causes it to start squealing.

04:19:39

Before it goes into the familiar satchel, youtube just tears.

04:19:49

Wait, i couldn't hear you. What did you say not the cloak?

04:19:59

If you know that's the fate that they're all expecting and then youtube oh my god, it just clicked for me.

04:20:11

It's cool. It was super dark but youtube does fucking appear out of a rift because yes that's probably what they're saying.

04:20:25

Oh no there's so many more. Hello little ones. Um, why don't you all go on ahead without me. I'm gonna keep these little ones comfortable and calm. No, no one's gonna put you in a cloak. Okay, no, no one's gonna eat you. Oh, she takes the, what do you mean the bird stole one of your brother?

04:20:46

She opens his familiar satchel and gently sets a piglet back down on the ground and walks away. Ochi, would you like to care for one of these? Piglets, it's just he should stay with. Its they should stay with their family until we can accommodate them. All right, if you promise to take it out of your satchel more than once a day.

04:21:11

Oh, g. Also raises into his familiar, satchel and pulls out the raven and sets it down. The raven goes to fucking town in here because there are worms and grubs. Yeah, he lets him free and says, would you mind keeping an eye on him? For me, he really needs to go out.

04:21:28

Yeah. The raven just 14 starts diving into shit and coming. Back out with worms and stuff to eat. This is the best possible place, you can brought it out and enclosed indoor area with food.

04:21:45

I saw a little aura in the space that i walk into. So i zoom go impacts into an invisible ninja.

04:21:57

Boom. Okay, the swine court, b12, the floor, you just climbed up to the floor of this open. Chamber runs with filth and refuse and swims with scores of cockroaches and rats as well. As over a dozen, piglets a huge table. Rises crookedly from the waist. This is no noise.

04:22:21

Really not. I think at this rate, we're gonna have enough food to feed a revolutionary army.

04:22:31

Just go to this.

04:22:39

Where was i a huge table rises. Crookedly from the waist. Uh, which is the filth on the floor? Not like the waste of you, the future remains of a huge feast on a tarnished. Silver silver, including a half devoured, pig's head with a hand thrust into its mouth. Leering out from the center of the revolting.

04:22:59

Meal numerous wardrobe is hang from the walls while countless rusted weapons. Dangle unhooks from the ceiling above the stone stairs continue to stagger upwards. So, in the southwest corner. Let me see if they're stuck in here. Oh, did anyone pack sift the cantrip? Sift. Excellent. We don't have to get risked deep into this, into the into the layers, on the floor.

04:23:30

Looking for treasure bowl, perception. What people are going to get rusty? Do you think? Okay, you think paiso would hide loot inside? I absolutely believe that they have hidden to lose behind a goblin toilet, man. Oh, i remember that one who looks through a goblin's toilet uh sheepishly raised his hand.

04:23:58

At that one. Oh, i get deep in there. Uh yes. Yes, you do. Uh, but that's not what this perception is for. And the only reason you got it is because you rolled the natural 20. It's a DC 25. Uh, grayson before anyone else, you notice like immediately, the smell of roasting pork uh, because you're grayson.

04:24:22

Uh even though that that pork on that table does not look like a freshly roasted pork and this smells like freshly roasted pork. Does it seem like the smell is like wafting down from a higher level? Nope, it's from this level. Um, i need you to roll a will save for me.

04:24:40

Shoko. Oh dear, i'm not good at those.

04:24:49

Yeah, you're not. Wow, of all the time seeing it now. Yeah. It's so how do i turn the dice back on yoco? Um, you feel snow. Oh hungry, so hungry? No, i need another will save from you. No, no no, no, no, no, no. Choko are you are you drooling?

04:25:28

I'm having flashbacks to the docus dungeon twos, the harvest child, but

04:25:41

Another will favor if you please, how do you turn the dice on?

04:25:49

It was an 18, i'm so sorry. So, you turned into that song by going to your configure settings, on the configure settings, tab, and you want dice so nice. In the left side, menu. I see it. Thank you, sorry. You were very welcome. Uh, shoko, so, so hungry. I everything here.

04:26:16

Looks absolutely delicious. The table is covered in a feast. Uh, but more than that, is the piglet that's by your foot. Just looks and smells so delightful. This is why there's a cmb check to catch. Piglets isn't there? They have that written down on the page. Give me a CMB check, as you are possessed by how jao the wild cannibal hog.

04:27:03

Okay, at least my roles are consistently terrible. You grab the flat footed. Squealing piglet.

04:27:13

And you bite it. I think you have a bite attack. Don't you did you ever make it? No. Why would i ever use my bite attack in case you're possessed by a cannibal spirit that loves eating piggies?

04:27:31

These piglets are not as enthusiastic as the ones downstairs, these are the slow moving ready to eat ones.

04:27:43

I have a high attack that deals one d4. Yes, you do but it's plus by strength, isn't it? It. No happy. You've been giving me shit for my strengthous entire campaign and it finally pays off. I won't murders. The tiny piggy. Hopefully you have because we do too much non-leafal damage.

04:28:09

It's about to cover it. It's true. So uh, give me a roll. Uh, well also get the grappled condition with your grappling. Uh, well okay. So i hit. Um yep. Definitely hit 1v4 minus 3.

04:28:41

One little one non-lethal. All right, so as you're your jaws start, like almost gumming on this piglet, you feel intense, intense, frustration, and free.

04:29:07

Uh, so anyone want to react to shoko, just scooping up a package? An important question. Now, Grayson still trying to find the source of the the the roast pig smells. So that's why he's walking around the room. Eight bubble barbarian. I yeah. Soco just picked up a piggy and started trying to eat it.

04:29:26

Guys, i don't think the other ones are going to like this, no way. Where's you two? Can we get her up here real quick? Let them up here real quick. And like, shoko looks wild-eyed and is probably just like going. Like, it is not seem like himself. Why is nobody still out there?

04:29:48

Oh, she's on the bridge. She kept going up. She didn't stop to search through. No. Why would you? What else? This way and as well, i'll make it doesn't seem to be moving, is like excuse now. We're all probably hear something. Uh, you definitely hear a lot of piggies.

04:30:10

Go wild haha. That you've gone wild. That was stupid. I'm sorry. I apologize to everyone. Praising of that particular literature is babes gone wild, which is babes gone. Wild says, no way to the to the main list narato. God. But that's what we wanted. Okay, well's koya and i may go say shoko.

04:30:39

What are you doing?

04:30:43

Uh, can i speak? Uh yes, you're just compelled to immediately. Consume a meal of the most unpleasant things available unless there's a pig available. So if there hadn't been piggies here, you would have been eating the shit on the floor. So hungry and i continue trying to eat the pig.

04:31:09

Ah, um, Oh, she's gonna put a hand on show goes on and be like here, dude, have one of these cookies. Well, wait on the pigs, why not? And he's gonna give him one of the fucking like pumpkins, see chia seed, cardboard, trail rations that he has

04:31:31

Oh, jeez, and you're sickened for three hours. I'm sicken for three hours. No, no, not you. A second for three hours because he ate one of my cookies. No shoko will be sicken for one day. Six hours for failing, his will saving against the gluttony. Uh, but i will say, since you can't seem to get through to the piggy because it would take you at least a minute of gumming and distincts.

04:32:04

You enough damage to kill it alone. Let alone consume it. Can i change my nice change my bit that i did to be like choco dude. Use your dentures, man. Why are you doing? Why is that you're complain? Sort of me trying to devour the live animals because i wanted to get the old man Shogo joke in there.

04:32:28

I had to do it. The open box mouth with no teeth in it. That's awful. Now, as far as other things in this room, well, greyson is wondering around the silver, salver and feasting set on the table are worth 800 gold pieces in total. They are of very, very fine.

04:32:53

Make that looks very similar to dwarven craftsmanship from Avastan. But with an eastern bend among the trophies upon the wall, our foot tall, gold and brown is a foot tall. Golden bronze dragon figure. Where 200 a silver inlaid box. That seems to contain hop goblin teeth. The box is worth.

04:33:22

200 a kukri inlaid with gold leap. Decorated with superb. Filigree depicting herons, that were shoko. Not currently possess and eating terrible thing above the ground. Uh, might be a good gift to me. Arrow and a fine silver and copper candle holder. In addition to masterwork glaves, hang among the many useless weapons dangling from the ceiling blades.

04:33:53

You say plus two or two. Masterwork glaze. Yes. Yo, i could do the actual warrior poet thing, how much is the the kukri worth? Then put them on the list, i believe. And then i can handle holder. Oh no. There's much more than that. I will drop it in just a second.

04:34:17

Oh okay. Let's go. I find that guys. So weirdly attractive, and i think it's just because i like big noses, very awkward. Uh, john bernthal. Yeah, that's my girlfriend's number one, like hottest, man alive, so you're not alone. Okay, i literally just copied and pasted the other thing, why can't they copy and paste this?

04:34:46

Because,

04:34:54

Come on.

04:35:04

I'm actually hungry in real life now. Thanks, that is fair. Uh, yes. So it is worth a hundred of fine silver and copper candle holder were 65. In addition to masterworks, no way up on the rooftop, the spiral stairs. Stumbled to the sight are the spiral stairs stumbled to the roof of the keep, which lies barely 10 feet, from the ceiling above, a narrow walkway clings to the rope top and eventually reaches a stone bridge like gracefully arches from the roof of the keep to a small stone balcony on the far cave wall upon the rooftop and only starks.

04:35:45

I and it looks like the stones. Excuse me. It disappears into the darkness. The tunnel is more than 200 feet long. She'll go. You, give into your ravenous hunger and just starts shoveling stuff from the ground into your mouth. No, until you are full and satiated and are then sickened for three hours.

04:36:14

So oh hey. Come on about 12 seconds to climb up here and you guys have been busy for at least two of choco's reprizes. So whoops. What's the crack? That is a 200 foot long tunnel. Yes. Thank you nerika. God, i'm aware for 200 foot voluntal, but the question was you oh excuse me, i didn't hear you.

04:36:42

I'm sorry, you're mike. Volume is usually like a good number of decibels, lower than everybody else's. Ah, wonderful. Uh you have been busy. It took me 12 seconds to get up here. What's the deal way? Shoko's really hungry for something and we were, yeah, we found more stuff.

04:37:07

That's wonderful. Explanation show goes hungry. We found stuff. They kind of grabs you by the elbow and leads you away from the piggies shoko. Oh, and i heard it. The like almost doesn't more that we found up there downstairs to give to youtube. Oh, okay. Do i willingly go with her?

04:37:30

Yeah. What's, what's your sadie saciated? The gluttony fades just about like licking the outside of a piglet. No, he shoveled. A bunch of fill from the floor into his valve. None of you stopped me. Nobody do that. I offered you a cookie. You didn't respond. You were too busy.

04:37:51

Did not say the glass gluttony because you were coming to piglet. Okay. We're all we're all acting weird. What the fuck?

04:38:03

Do i have control of my faculties? Do i remember what just happened? Yeah, completely. Oh, you're not raging anymore by the way, so we can turn that off. But we'll go ahead and leave the buff on you. So, do i know i was possessed or, um,

04:38:29

You can, you can pretty much guess. It's the second time it's happened to you.

04:38:39

Then um, Trucker will stumble up the stairways clearly like bring the gills and then lean over the side of the building and just throw up. Uh, are you okay? No, no, i am not. Okay. And i look up with with just red bloodshot eyes.

04:39:14

Although up, let me collect myself and shut go take a minute, breathe in and out. And let the rage leave him.

04:39:26

So none of you thought that was weird. I think it's very weird. Then why didn't you? Well, i did no one do anything. Why? I didn't know what to say. Anything. What the fuck are you talking about, sugar? I don't possessed by a spirit down there. Do you want again to stop the best every time you do weird stuff because we're not we're not gonna get very far.

04:39:54

I tried to eat a live pig. Oh gee. What about that seemed? Even remotely in the wheelhouse of normal to you. I'm not gonna, i'm not gonna do this, not doing this. I mean, i figured you just smelled that roast big smell. I smelled and we're just really hungry.

04:40:13

Do you think i am actually an animal? Do you know that people and animals, right? Yes. Oh, you're not going anywhere. By the way. Go. Go move super objects before is cheeks. Balloon cartoonishly and he leans back over that vomits again. Oh yeah, like pads your bag. You've had a real rough run since we got in this forest.

04:40:45

I'm so sorry. Look man, like you weren't hurting the piglet. I wasn't about to tell you how to live your life, you know?

04:40:58

Oh, sans. I assume that that horde list was what we found on the first floor. I think you said yes. Yes, that was from the so giants. All right, i just and you got all the the items that i listed, right? I don't have to type them out and god, oh god, i think i swallowed a rat.

04:41:15

Oh, walking out, definitely some cockroaches.

04:41:24

Uh, so quiet has protection from evil on you. But even work against spirits. I'm working because i don't know that's gonna play. But if you are if it is a contortion effect then yes. But only like a wonder compelled. It doesn't help you from being. Is it is it gone?

04:42:00

Oh no, i would know. She's very confused. You don't feel any different right now. So no way if i'd burnt over and started shoveling literal shit into my mouth, you would think that was someone weird and out of character, right? I don't come off as that kind of guy, right?

04:42:19

I thought it was very weird. Another character. That's why i've been trying to stop you. But look, man. I am a 67 year old. Did you want me to beat you, unconscious? Because i will next time honestly coya. If i start eating cockroaches you have permission to use violence.

04:42:43

Oh, okay, very well done. Let's continue on. Then i accept your terms and also you also shoko was more shrouding at a grayson and oak shape. I mean joker you've been with the this group program, what? Really long time. Now it we all do weird things now and then it's like what you said if you had to stop you every time.

04:43:07

You know, oh gosh, he'd slows down so much. Yeah, makeup looks at me. Arrow could tell i was possessed instantly but apparently none of you can. I don't know. She's just really in tune with you. You guys, you see him just like two points. Just kind of like comes over to show and just grabs a hold of shows and his shoulders and like squares them up for a minute.

04:43:33

Looks at him properly and then just pulls out a cloth my pocket. And it's just like, okay, so first off, get that off your face, second. No, no, i wouldn't let you start eating a bunch of nonsense that seems entirely bad for you digestive system. And if nothing else, i'll have to hear about it later on when we're out of here.

04:43:52

So, he could probably use some fiber at his age, which reminds me or also going to find I mean, i just assumed this is a myko who's kind of looking over the edge of the tower. I just assumed you were getting ready to feed Ochi.

04:44:12

That would be really nice of him. I'm Don't go does not say anything to his empress. Bab just an fyi. If your subjects start acting a bit weird, you are well, within your rice is empress to like bop them and make sure that they're not acting weird. Hey well hey, whoa.

04:44:38

If you're gonna address a mako, it has to be lady babe. You get punched in the ar. Oh, she's being serious. He said, use your title. Come on now shoko. Breathes out in his shoulders. Sag defeatedly. Let's just this is the best this is let's just keep going. Yes, it's definitely a group of friends at this point.

04:45:13

So this is where we're gonna be wrapping up. Uh, so we're going to take you not like in that formation. The tunnel that you've go down. Goes 200 feet deeper down. Slanting, slightly, copy, and paste. Some wiring noise all can be like crafting kit. She has the equivalent of mouthwash and just like shakes one up real quick here.

04:45:56

It's just vinegar, it's kind of awful side of vinegar. Yep, that's totally fair.

04:46:23

Hell, that was

04:46:32

The worst part of it is that now after throwing everything up, shut goes just hungry again.

04:46:40

Uh, that's pretty true. You guys start hearing the sound of rushing water. As you go down this, slight slant. The bridge ends at a neural shelf of rock. High above the cabin floor. At its rear a corridor. The sense steeply into the rock. The stone shelf is barely, five feet wide, but the corridor is beyond soon opens up crude stone steps have been worn into the floor of the corridor, which descends over 200 feet.

04:47:14

The thundering roar of another waterfall fills. This chamber, the water falls from a subterranean river, some 90 feet above to the north plunging into a cold deep lake. The far side of the lake stands. A crooked. Pagoda carved with the forms of twisted animals as if in mockery of the pagoda and the daylight high above a raised drawbridge, hangs from the front of it.

04:47:43

Oh, you'll see all of that. If you come of it further, the drum bridge is down over here.

04:47:58

And that is where we are going to end this week. Welcome to the mockery pagoda. It's a real Russian nesting doll situation in here. Isn't it? Yeah, going that one. And then inside is going to be another pagoda. Well, you know that asian themes are very big on juxtaposition of opposing forces and elements balance, all that good stuff.

04:48:29

Uh ocean and I'll make ocean. Probably take good. Hope off. By now, by now in has been, i mean in heaven, unless you guys want to take a rest because good hope is 10 minutes per level. No, it's one minute per level heroism. This time, right? And i, i threw good.

04:48:50

Hope on you guys. Like at the ambush at the beginning. I forgot that camera. There we go. That's all.

04:49:03

But yeah, that's where we're gonna call it for tonight. Thank you. As always, folks, for staying a little later. I really enjoy this game. A great deal. Yeah. It was quite fun. That was a good one there. Oh, fights, i made way too many jokes. There's a good time.

04:49:18

All of the anger at the end was purely showed. I i thought that the pig was hilarious. Oh no. We, we know we should go.

04:49:29

That's totally fine. Okay, so you do stand down with the apparently good because it now has a bunch of kids to take care of. Yeah you too has like 20 children now. Yeah, you you mentioned. You mentioned not to know because you should be kind of likewise those who says she died.

04:49:49

She literally has the hulk out to keep separated the three entourage. Snow leopards. 20 banklifts. So, how much hp does the do the penguins have? Like how like if i had actually managed to do damage to it? What i thought you were going to ask how much hp do they restore if you do eat them.

04:50:10

All right. So technically it would be a young pig. So it will have minus 4 to its constitution bringing it to an 11 uh which gives it. Oh, three hp. So you actually could have killed that that piglet. Now that i'm looking at it. Um, but you didn't, you ate the filth and then you vomited back up and the piglets were freed because i couldn't stand the thought of describing a piglet dying.

04:50:41

Yeah, that was. I don't know if you ever played with piglets but they're adorable. They're really cute. Um, that's not forget. My bird is also in with the entourage. That's true. Yes, if i eating the fuck out of cockroaches, just like could you keep an eye on them and if you do sense, that something happens to me just in the same way, like i'll come running.

04:51:07

Thanks dear. And i'm just and then just like leave some, it's no, that's no way. She's actually very nice even if she's a little grep on the outside, like probably won't be with you. I feel like what we're gonna have a side game. One of these, where we each play, like, one of the little tiny companions on some little cute adventure, or something i would heck and run that actually, no, i was gonna say instead of that.

04:51:31

Maybe a smarter thing would be to tell you to, like, if things go bad, maybe go fetch the others in the caravan and like send them to rescue us. No, no. I'm really looking forward to, uh, a mako coming back as way. And the way coming back is youtube me coming back as a tiny bird and everybody else coming back is leopards.

04:51:56

I i think by the grace of sukio himself, you do might have some sense to go and perhaps get the motor machine. That is really before before we, uh yeah, let's hit the party screen and swap out a mako for first away. I'll leave for this part, get that sweet favorite enemy because there's a lot more hobgoblins guys.

04:52:25

Yeah. So considering if there's a big waterfall in the way, uh, and like how far away i was when i started my initial performance late there might be a chance that uh we didn't alert the rest of it. Oh wait no runners there. There was a runner. Yeah, she did let the runners go.

04:52:45

So this is a massive waterfall. So, this level had no chance of hearing your drums at all. Uh, so that's good for you. Uh, because this is a big fucking dungeon. I seem to remember you giving the exact number of how many levels this dungeonism is like, yeah, this this is.

04:53:08

All right, we're doing the the hob rig on speed run right now. Oh, so this section of the dungeon has three floors of its own. The next section of the dungeon has two floors and then there's a final floor. This is not counting all the floors that were in the pagoda which seems small by comparisons.

04:53:24

It really knows large. It's very large. I have put so much work into this dungeon like i'm so excited about it like this thing is look super sick. The whole way through that's like thank you very dungeoning but like still, like visually has been interesting, which is i don't, maybe it's just my experience because all we've had is like a lot of the jade region maps so far, which some were really awesome, and some were like, all right, it's me like mick.

04:53:52

Yeah, like it's a map. This, this has been super great to like, play on the whole time. This. Yeah. This dungeon is a lot better than uh you know three dungeons. I would say nine like five, if all the stairs and doors were installed, man. 10 out of 10.

04:54:11

Like, comparing this to brown a lot of missing doors. Where the doors are supposed to be. Oh yeah. That was unfortunately the levels mod uh when i said the the no it's actually kind of a fucked up glitch. Uh when you set an elf, an elevation for walls. I if you don't do it to each wall individually, they all default to the primary wall that you have highlighted.

04:54:40

So if that's a normal wall, it turns all of your doors into normal walls. Hell. Yeah, perfect. But if i primary a door, it turns all my walls into doors. Perfect. No, we can walk straight through the whole thing. We wouldn't have to do all this nonsense. I have fixed all of them though.

04:54:59

So yeah, you have would you there for gym? Says no way from the map say that this map is in fact adorable.

04:55:10

It's pretty good shitty puns. All the way to the bank. This is what sukio brought me back for. I think, wait a single, i didn't get a single chuckle for habergon at all the hurt. My feelings, guys, hopper gun. I didn't hear hopper gone. You when shoco was talking about the drums and the runner.

04:55:33

Oh, well like that, that's fun though, he's conscious. Now we're doing the uh, we're doing the hob, rug on speed run. Actually, i think you'll find the sukio entirely induced to the idea. I don't get it. You know. Him. We're gone. Oh my god. Stucchio's very pro-humor because it's an excellent source of self self-care and boosting your own mental health.

04:55:57

It kills the soul to be redeemed by your, by your own. Well then, uh, okay, that's the choice that you want to take, then you can live with that. Yeah. So if you think sukio the prince of the moon doesn't crack jokes on occasion just to make people feel better, you would be wrong sir, he's entire mythology around his chosen zodiac symbol is to do with the fact that he has rabbits making rice cakes on the fucking moon.

04:56:28

That's what youtube was doing before he came here. That's why it's so strong. Wait, you choose a heat? I don't keep just choosing a random gender. I have been changing, what? The pronouns i use on youtube on purpose. Actually, yeah. It doesn't matter which one we would have said, no, i would have just not have been gone.

04:56:49

Yeah, yeah. All right. On that note. I got youtube. It's not an actual rabbit. You two is a celestial being just like, way yet. But weigh-in is very male. I'll see y'all next week and an actual monkey. Thank you. And well, no, he's actually a show.
