00:01

To help you. He like looks up. Like, do i have to Hops down genuflex. In front of you, we humbly offer our apologies for this lapse in law that caused this to happen. Now will you please save mankind? You know what that is more than i was expecting? Uh i think i think i'm good with that sharko says try to look the other way energy.

00:36

You seem like sharpening is nice. Oh, he might be okay with that. I'm well and then goblins. Yeah. Yeah, it's like box stepping with hands and pockets. Just kind of like, i'm not okay with it. And then just i'm waiting. So after you're dizzying descent, the seamless endless seemingly endless shaft.

01:05

Finally ends the torturously narrow steps in the shaft's broadband into huge stone flag stairs, that descend sharply into a wide smooth weld chamber. The room widens. Is it slopes upward to the northeast of you ending at a vast wall of huge stone blocks. Rusting double iron doors. Bristling with bloody spikes.

01:27

You see Bobby's skewered upon this wall offering. The only passage through the air is hot and smells of sweat and toil and then the goblins on the massive wall to the east. Let loose their volume arrows. Hot couplings. I should say getting away freshly alive. Well we'll see. Yes hello.

01:53

I was doing a music thing sitting right here at my desk. I fucking hate my life so much. So you you see her kind of skipping back. I was like oh come on, i can't be that. But on out of the dark comes this arrow and it just like straight in your sternum and she just kind of goes

02:17

All looks down at it.

02:22

I can't in a mix of like blatant confusion for a moment and then just books an absolute agony like

02:37

23 days. Show goes flat-footed. Oh, oh yeah. Flat-footed, yeah. Oh yeah. Um,

02:58

Yeah, why? Yeah. Oh,

03:08

These are some wonderful roles from these dog goblins. I know that one hit coya. By the way. Not you. No way. This is your last arrow. This is the pathfinder. This is what happens to you. When you play Pathfinder, i played more king maker. And i got to, uh, a fight with a troll boss and it created a mere and then it created a hard rim, like back to back in the same full attack action.

03:30

Like 66 and 55 i cried deeply uh 19 to hit your flat footed AC up there. No way for four? Yeah so yeah, the one hour lines, the second one kind of splices next to it and she just kind of goes

03:53

As clear. Also catches an arrow in the tummy. No one told me there's actually hurts. Goblins goblins? And now, if everyone but please join combat, lock in your minds.

04:24

Always only had a plus five. I feel like i had a trade for initiative.

04:33

I feel like i should like buy lottery tickets.

04:41

No, i guess not. Huh? I guess. It was a five percent chance to fucking crap, man. What do you do? I crits all the time. I crit on you and the party healer. It's true. Please stop. Oh look and they're going before you at least, it's just one of them.

05:12

It's two of them, what?

05:18

Uh, no way another. Yeah, you're rolling hard. No, i really am.

05:30

Unfortunately uh only the second one of this, i forgot a 23, the fucking hit. Jesus christ. Yeah, you you just like, i was gonna make a comment about how nobody thinks that. Like her body isn't moving correctly since we're. No, she's pretty fucking convinced now, right? No way. It's gonna have to take a nap for a month.

05:58

She'll go 27 and 18 against your flat footed. Second one. Misses the first one hits because uh, get to 27.

06:13

Fuck me. Know, they have sneak attack. Not at that range. They fucking know, right? Right range. What happens conversation? We did. Okay, notice i forgot just ivy. Just deletes her token off the screen. No, no, no. I refused. I just realized my bone. Uh, i take 10 less damage your bone.

06:42

Yes, my bone that's always floating above me and gives me dr5 legendary.

06:55

She pulls out a sunflower seed and pumpkin seed cookie and eats it to get that five health. He got his bird friends, might be my new favorite, it's all tastes like, damp park, bench gross,

07:23

Oh gee, just carries around like a refrigerator box and cuts out little circles out of it. Needs them.

07:33

Sorry, i'm nearly done with your future and i my, my full attention will be given to the game at that point. So i do apologize speed running in the background.

07:48

Uh so i'll make i was seeing a bunch of her friends, like become porcupines. Yeah, kind of rushes up points their hands into the darkness because she can't see anything cast magic missile.

08:08

Into the darkness. Uh she designed you don't have to see anything cast. Fireball, you you don't actually I and countries up a bead of fire that shoots off into the darkness impacting with the wall and exploding in fire. Literally,

08:36

Uh one of them takes no damage. The other things have. Okay, so these are not just these are not just hops. These are these are advanced hobs. These are hogs that know what they're doing. Uh, these are withered blossom, warriors who are moving with the skill of martial artists.

09:03

Shoko. Oh god, are they all's in our church? Oh, like no sneak attack. The background wall with four zen arches fans vengeance. He's like i'm now playing Tower Defense. Oh, abdication.

09:40

Oh yeah. I think we're gonna go with one of these. Where should we go? One of these is just any ac bonus. No, no, AC bonus there. Yes. Please please please. Stop hitting me.

10:04

Uh, five images and then.

10:17

So, this is a neat effect for me or image.

10:24

Isn't it? Yes though, big fan.

10:30

Don't just don't stare at yourself too long. Which might actually be what mirror image looks like normally. Pretty. Uh, enter. Pleased to be distracted by his own spell. I forget what my feeds are even called. What's the one where i can to move action game. Defeat a combat feet barram roller.

11:04

That's the one.

11:10

Do i use it right now? Question mark. Oh, i have 40 feet of them so i could actually could i get a 10 more feet up here? We're not going to use it today already. You could get there. Okay. Do i have stuff going on? Okay, i have my 60 feet of moves, okay?

11:43

That's not an interview. Well, that's 15 feet.

12:00

Yeah, we're gonna move all the way up here.

12:10

Ochi makeup perception, check as you approach the wall.

12:20

As you approach the wall, you see the bloodied body. That's skewered on one of the largest spikes of the, the rusted iron door kind of majorly, lifted his hand, and you hear a soft quiet, pain voice.

12:38

Oh, it seems the person in bailed upon the door remains alive. That's a not good. Uh oh she's gonna yell back less fireballs. There's someone on the spikes um and okay so luckily she threw it over here. They are elevated up 10 feet. So, i'm gonna assume that i could have seen them as i approached.

13:03

But now, i don't have line of sight on them, or they do because i can't, they you, are you having your line of sight blocked from there now? Right? Because i'm close enough to the wall, okay? Correct del also means their line of sight to you is blocked. Yes, that's good.

13:17

Enough for me right now. I think i have five more feet. I think i did 15 and then 100. So i'm going to step a little bit closer. I guess not. I think i think it's doing the thing again but i'm going to go to that square there went and uh i think that's going to be my turn for right now.

13:42

Yeah i yelled back less fireballs. There's someone on this bikes.

13:52

And then they can go.

14:03

I does anyone speak goblin? I don't think OG does.

14:11

I think oh she's the only one really close enough to hear. Anyways, you see this one step up to the edge. Oh, hell yeah, i thought there was only two. There is four, there it is for, but he misses with his arrows miss

14:53

He is going to keep his target.

15:01

Uh, lose an image and a total width. Yeah, two arrows. Pierce through your image, the other one. Striking the ground next to you, Grayson

15:16

Um, christ, it's going to move up.

15:35

And i guess who's going to take uh one shot one. I've got selected is in front of uchi. Um, he will do a perfect strike so it's gonna roll three times. But you use whatever's the highest.

15:58

Got it a real. Fuck that. One in particularly boom. Boom. The funny thing is, all three of those would have hit.

16:14

So it's just the the one damage roll, right? He moved. Double almost double. Oh no! It said, yellow. I remember 60 feet which is my movement monk. Monk among us. All right, that arrow sails through the air piercing that hop goblin through his shoulder.

16:43

Well, let's be all for you sir. No way. How the fuck is koya? Laugh on initiative. I don't know how are you last on initiative. Also, uh, rips out one of those arrows and just gives it an eye. Like, this is gonna fucking toys of me, is it? I look like i just got this king body back uh but yeah what she's gonna do.

17:10

Okay. So, what exactly? Because i can see this whole chamber. Um, what is like the extent of that wall? Is it like full top to ceiling uh, aside from where the, the gaps are that they're firing from?

17:33

So it does, it does go from floor to ceiling and then there's a 10 foot by 10 foot wide opening on the, the walls where the two hobgoblins are shooting from on each side, is there now. So this is where i have to be like, what's the client check for that wall?

17:52

Uh it's pretty spiky. What's the what's the jump shot for? No way to just jump 10 feet, vertically, 40, 40, acrobatics to jump the 10 feet vertically. It's true. Um, okay. Realistically there is a bunch of things that i could do, but oh yes, we're going to have no way.

18:22

Be very, very, very feels bad man. Uh, rip out those hours immediately like disappears and i get to be like, please tell me they can't see invisible people. As i use the reaction, they cannot excellent, because that that is well within my reach

18:49

Just like you should go emoji. Definitely here like and grace. If you can hear the whole way, just like a lot of every attacking words being said right to the cross, the south like no, your ass is mine. Coyote sides, as you. Take off into the darkness without getting healing.

19:15

Probably fine steps over to Ameko, grabs her and steps through a door of starlight

19:29

Are you fucking cheaters?

19:36

Young slightly, as you just appears from one place and instead of to the other, okay, weeks, at you

19:53

Coyote, i love you but fuck off. Um no. Does it? Heal spiky guy. I know, it does not. Oh, because he is not in her vision. She's right in front of him. On the map. She can't see him. She's 10 feet down. Oh, he's like up. Yeah, they're up on a wall.

20:18

No. No, the guy on the spikes. Oh no, it definitely gets them. Sorry i thought you were talking about the hop goblins. They are also probably spiky, but she's like, right in front of where the yeah, no. Uh, she has enough that she can heal all both of them, as well as all of you.

20:35

Just questioning if she saw him and knew, or saw them and new to heal them. After i mentioned it.

20:44

Yes, she would have seen when she appeared.

20:53

That's templates. Still not quite right. But they're both within 30 feet. Oh, there's another. Yeah, they actually slide off the spikes and slumped to the ground. I didn't even see the other one. Wow. Okay, yeah. They're two of them one on eachadore that is unfortunately. Oh no. That one's dead.

21:13

That's, that's just a dead body out, withered blossom, warrior,

21:27

Steps. Why are you losing elevation every time you?

21:37

Grayson, you struck him with an arrow. He's snarls and fires back. Both of which i believe miss you right now. Correct, does he get a bonus for being in higher elevation? That would still? Because the answer is, yes, okay.

22:21

Rowboat sands.

22:26

Yeah, you're around now.

22:37

About that. Now, you're good better? Okay, uh, and i guess a roll of d5.

22:50

25. You are what other whatever is taking bandwidth is really not heavily today, but nothing else.

23:26

Games. Discussed guys, pretty convinced. It's kind of okay. Am i still a robot? Not anymore. Okay. I will speak slower than so that hopefully it takes less work to transfer the sound of my voice. Yes. Yeah, we'll go with that. That i don't know. Not how that works. Also, uh, your you're coming out, my drums should be fixed, obviously need to add them to your things if you want to click and drag it over onto.

24:07

Boom. My guys street, you'll just need to drag it into your uh big pool to the top of classes masterpiece, caminari drums. Oh, i almost gave it to Grayson, get great, some flame strike. What's the worst? Well actually don't know. He would never use it. All right. And then i drag it onto his arctic performance link charges.

24:47

And then it should lift itself at 34 out of 34 and it up five every time you cast it. All right. Thank you. Abby, thank you. Abby everyone say, thank you. Abby, thank you. Abby not necessary. Please please. I apologize for pausing. I'm what i'm sure is very serious time as these fucking goblins.

25:18

So omiko, like steps back, uh, and just continues launching flames and it's got, oh, those poles hit. They are 13, touch AC. Oh wow.

25:42

And so much health, not for long. So yes, she launches, two of those golden flames, they collide with the wizard blossom. Warrior, who seems to for the most part, shrug them off, bringing us to shogo.

26:09

Uh,

26:26

How far away am i from everyone? Probably. Oh yeah. Not not close enough to start virtual alsoing yet, uh,

26:51

And we'll get up to there.

26:59

And through some good hope on the four of you appear.

27:16

I can't i probably can't target. No, i can. I it's not like a splash. I have to don't see here. You do have to target.

27:27

That is the way it goes and i'm 40 feet away from coyot. So yeah, it's just on the coachee and coya. They get this koya added sea invisibility to her list of preparatory spells.

27:49

I can't imagine why.

27:58

And then i'm on my turn. Yeah, that's how she always seems to know where you are. No. Oh, i just assumed that. That was bullshit. Does no reasoning and i'm still thinking that it's bullshit. It's still bullshit. Doesn't the reasoning? Like i guess i've got to do this so i can make sure she doesn't kill herself.

28:15

Not i would never kill myself. Okay. So since it's my turn again off check, i have bark skin, good, hope and heroism. I think that choko did bark skin and i know he just refreshed good. Oh, did he hit me with major armor or mako? Yes, i did drummer.

28:34

I hate you with my drummer heroism. Also still on. I just don't want to be cheating. Um, pretty sure her. Yeah, all of those. Should still be good. Okay, cool. Oh, gee, where did we get heroes from?

28:52

Pretty sure a mako. Did heroism on a couple of people. Yeah and it's 10 minutes per level so yeah, she she gots heroism on you and then our 10 foot window is between the two. Joblins that is correct. Okay, oh g is really tired of people being at higher elevation than him.

29:14

He's channeling that into the biggest jump he's ever done in his life. So, we are going to

29:27

Og is jumping with rage. So i would like to get up to the wall and then jump 10 feet in the air up onto the wall. I don't know if there's do, do i have to walk into the wall and then jump next to it? Or can i move forward to space in conjunction?

29:52

I don't know how the rules are for that if i'm traveling vertically. So we'll move you up here like this. Yes, i automate it i'll still roll. If there's if uh, one uh, yeah you could budge, i suppose. So you know i mean even with a batch though, you're acrobatics is still high enough to do a 10 foot jump.

30:15

So you're fine. It's uh, what the hell?

30:22

Oh, it already gave me the 20. Wow, i didn't know it did it. So it would have been a 41 which, which was still planning, you had 10 feet of movement. Yeah. Okay, so i'm here.

30:39

Uh, your robo voicing again. And i would like to do one step on my new hobgoblin friend.

30:52

Which were fun. I'm just gonna assume, uh, evil one swing.

31:26

All right, are you back to us? Hello. All right, we can hear you. No. Okay. Your blood connect the golden light from the holy enchantment flashing as it strikes. The hobgoblin's evil flesh. Yeah. That's flames. Right? This thing is all fired fire. Yeah, cool beans.

31:53

And that's what she's turn. So, i would like to point out. Just how cool it was that. Oh, she did that. It was pretty worship, it was super woosha. He's very, very tired of people being above him and not able to stab them. The boom. Speaking of people being above few arrows, fly at the, uh, one pop of an image is within four enough.

32:24

Uh, that's within a yeah. Okay. Oh, we found it.

32:32

I don't want to bring this all to a halt but you are robo voicing again. Yeah. And we'll all do voicemail and you can do play by post.

32:51

It would be like the four of us playing an old school like text RPG. Yeah, west west. Oh yeah, you need to like sacrifice more children to your internet provider or something like right now. Yes, currently. Yeah. I had some solar knockers come by yesterday, magnets. I'm sure you can relate and their new spiel and i, i used to knock.

33:27

So i know how it goes and i'd like it kind of just annoys me the tactics that they use now because i'm usually like, really nice to them. Like, hey guys, i'm a runner. But like, you know, i'm happy to chat. I know these people down the street own something, and like, give them a glass of water, or whatever.

33:40

Because it sucks to be walking around. Outside get told no, by literally everyone but they're a little opening spiel was like oh srp just got the authorization do so and so increase and i'm like i know what you're doing but like i don't want to talk to you for long enough to tell you that.

33:58

I know what this bullshit is. Can you please just get off my porch? I don't want to do this. I'm like dude i don't even i'm from california. It's srp. What does that mean? You know what i mean? I don't i just pretend i'm not home. That would be the socially anxious thing to do.

34:20

Oh, i usually give them like a granola bar. I'm like, you want to glass water, bro? No, you're not gonna sell me anything. I just you look tired.

34:32

I don't know why everyone out here doesn't have solar. It's sunny like 364 days a year.

34:44

Yeah, king maker has not gotten better. I thought, you know, once i started getting multiple attacks and no yeah it's like i have to say after every single fight, i'm like, who, this isn't even fun. I just feel like i have to now, you know, like did it? It's a game that was clearly made for people but no, how to to rock the pf1 system.

35:09

Yeah, everybody else to do that. And it's like, no, i'm very much like a, like, a build, a back story for a character in my head and like make everything hard for myself. As i think we all know at this point about OG with this special stick. So like i rolled like a slayer this time because last time i did rogue but like i'm trying to go into outdoori sword lord.

35:32

So like i get just turned into fucking pace by everything and like you know, the fight's over as soon as you're play, your character goes down. So yep. I just get like two shot at by like anything. That's like fighter classy and it feels really bad. It really sucks, but like,

35:56

I feel like i'd have a lot more fun if i played like a spellcaster or like an archer and let everybody else go in and die in front of me, but i have high decks. So, my initiative is always high. So i just feel like i'm delaying like every turn one.

36:11

And i'm like, this, i don't. This is, yeah, ultra and casting gets around that problem by being alterion casting. Yeah. Like yeah, being a mellor as somebody who played a straight up paladin during my first run of the game, like no, no archetypes or anything. Like i i strayed up palette.

36:31

Yeah. Um, john paladin, Gwen paladin did perfectly well, literally until the house of the end of time where that entire section is like, excuse you, um, like i thought the encyclopedia would be helpful because i'm fairly fluent in the past finder one system, but like a lot of like spell casting stuff i still don't know.

36:54

And like there's just not the encyclopedia is not there, the places that i need it to be, you know what i mean? I'm like, what is my castle level? How do i pop off these scrolls? And like yeah it's just oh the way i did. Scrolls was really weird.

37:09

Yeah. And like i don't the other problem i can't find anywhere where it tells me what the use magic device check is for a scroll. What the formula is so i'm still shooting in the dark. I should have just googled it by now but like how them like he has like a UMD of like plus one right now and i'm like never going to use a scroll with him.

37:29

Other people have like nine or ten and i'm like, i think i've got like a 30 to 40 percent chance to get this. Scroll to go off but i don't know. I'm gonna look at. I like only only game you off fighting the mishap, basically. It's like it's like eventually you just don't mishap just don't after like mid game it's or if you specialize in it by like scale focus and stuff and yeah it's like oh well yeah this is what i do now but that's the sacrifice of doing anything else.

38:01

Like many things in pathfinder. I'm trying to look up the the umd. Oh well, you empty rolls. Um, trying to remember here, uh, umd dc. I mean for one's and most like items. It's uh, what 20 flop. Um, skulls 20 plus cash roller. That's so much. That's so high.

38:32

Yep. So, here we go. Here's the table. Activate blindly 25, decipher a written spell, 25 plus, spell level use a scroll, 20, plus caster level use a wand, 20 emulate, a class feature, 20. All of that. That's so high. Yep. So and like i've been like just trying to find like a wand of cure light wounds and i don't know where to get one anywhere.

39:04

You have a bunch of scrolls i tried taking harem out and running around with gel fall, Jake fall and just popping scrolls between every fight and i burned through them so quickly because if you click them and activate them before the actual animation finishes and the little numbers come up it just cancels the last action and burns the scroll and then you have to use it.

39:24

Uses the new scroll. I went through like 15 cure light wounds by just like every other one of them wasn't actually activating so that was cool.

39:37

Yeah. Anyways. Sorry, i just thought i would bitch because you guys are the only people they know who know about Pathfinder one. Uh, reasonable retrospect. It is, it is quite a surprise. You to me, then alcat was so successful looking maker, but to the point that they even got to make a sequel.

39:57

Yeah. Considering like you would think the market for people who want to play a CRPG based on pathfinder one. You would not be big enough to to get them to this point. So, it's M, the most like narratively speaking. It's the most like here you go. Joe. Nobody and behind that wrath is probably the next one.

40:30

Yeah. Where it's like, it wouldn't it wouldn't work with any other aps. I don't think. And like, there's just so much story stuff. I bet it's like really fun if you've played through king maker before because you get to go around and like explore all the different feel like oh i know this place.

40:43

Yeah, yeah. But like me like i've never played any other aps and heard anything about king maker. So like there's so much of it where you can tell. It's like, punishing you for like not doing the right thing. Like, right off the bat you could either chase down tartushio and go to the ruins or like not and go to the wherever other place.

41:01

Yeah, i think like, off the top of my head, i think the ones that would actually do pretty well as like CLPGs rough. Yeah. With the way that they rewrote it, fine. Um, next make sense is larger than life, kind of, you know, epic whatever. And here's a bunch of different ways you can do this.

41:26

Um, king maker makes the obvious sense. Ah to an extent, i would argue probably held rebels those pretty well because paul's rebels takes place like entirely infantago. So you just have that as you're building block rather than i think. Yeah, you don't leave, can taco all happened out really like at all, but if you ground it down to be less of the out and about an adventure block and had it more be about like the character integration would probably work pretty well if you wanted to go the complete of the way and make it more about like a character narrative and basically make it more.

42:09

Um look, what's it called those there's another CPU that's coming to mind if you wanted to make it more philosophaternity and have that kind of experience you want my honest. Opinion. Jade region. I i need to message grayson and tell him that. Abby just called it path of eternity.

42:34

I am, it's very tired and also like i have been up since six this morning. Um, and have had the last three days of nothing but migrants. So time is construct. I i could not think think of the word epoxy earlier. I was desperately trying to think of the word epoxy and i just fucking couldn't hell.

42:59

Yeah. Aggravating moment with my fucking life but um, you know what i mean? I haven't left my house in like a week. Nothing is real. I've just played every maker. Everything is relative. Yeah, nothing is real. I just i don't even know. I feel yeah. I think spiritual. Yeah, i think jade vision will probably make sense in that kind of thing.

43:23

Um, the other one. Hello. All right, let's see how this goes. Another one in that kind of end off then reign of winter, but only as a meme. Yeah. Only as drunk Russian night would remain of windows. I've played one of them. So my knowledge, i would love to play a drunk russian.

43:44

I think skulls and shackles would be kind of cool depending on how open world. Yeah, i think i think part of what to make like just by making a game out of one of these is what both king maker and wrath have. And that's like a second thing to to say okay it needs a block.

44:06

Yeah, yeah. Of king. Maker has kingdom. Building wrath has managing the the the, the crusade it has that for one book, though. Like it doesn't come up again from what i found it. Roses written, it doesn't. But, theoretically, you could do stuff with it but, i mean, so yeah, yeah.

44:32

We were talking about kingmaker again because i've been crying deeply in my house. Playing it. Yeah, as the game as ellcats can maker. Yeah. I mean you totally could do skulls and shackles. Yeah. That's what we were saying which ones would be suited to doing it like that. Uh, the roomlords series would actually be pretty good for.

44:57

That was the most classical. Like so here do a dungeon kill bad guy. Types of aps. Yeah, but you get to go all over the hinterlands and you could even do like the shattered star dungeon as the deep dungeon for the game, like they were doing for the others just as ideas.

45:21

Anyways did this hobgoblin go? I remember yes. He fired at Ochi. Choco, i don't know why i keep saying OG. I'm sorry. Oh she is being woosha samurai right now. He's doing, he's doing his best.

45:43

Uh, okay. So this one it's actually going to fire a grace in because the fox is you're both unhitable. These two are just firing of volley of arrows, that is creating like a figure eight around the two of you.

46:02

Oh, it's probably a western shoot, the ground situation. Yeah. Jason uh okay, so i'll go and fire against the, the southernmost one. So in the in the dark here, he very calmly draws i think six arrows and find some again. Yep. The more you do this, the closer we get to sans actually hitting us with a wall of zen archers.

46:34

Well actually the first three arrows miss uh unluckily. But the third one criticals uh the fifth one hits and the keyboard hits and that critical. Help you bring him down. 55 points bows and glaves van bows and glaves. Just gonna take five foot seven. That's true, not not to be black guy.

47:14

I am actually curious. You're getting arrested from deliquis hasn't globes, right? Let's see. Correct. Don't stop multiply on correct. But all energy, doesn't multiply on grip because it's considered like additional die. Oh, it's in your it's just in the wrong damage formula section. It's i want to remove damage from me.

47:36

That's not the point here. It's just like, i genuinely do not know. I am not an expert at the character sheets with this. No, you're fine. I can fix it. Yeah, i think because it's a die. Generally the rule. Yeah. Like the general understanding i had to look this up recently.

47:54

Um if you roll a die it usually doesn't multiply if you do not roll a die if it's static damage it usually do we go. So we put it in the non-critical damage. Formula. Multiply no, just not. Multiply the sneak attack is additional die and they just precision rogues would be way better if they did, rogues would be the best classify far.

48:25

They should give it to roads, but only to change ropes. I don't hate unchanged roads. I don't oh the point is trained. Rogue is absolutely fucking worthless. Yeah, i was again. Nothing king maker bullshit. I was like, i could replace a rogue with an optimist and do it. No way.

48:51

You're up. Uh yeah, yeah. We understand wall so that i can start stabbing people. Thank you elevation. By 10 feet. I won't i'm just got. Okay, body really mad. Even though it's an abstract concept, that you spends three key points to do, what no way can just do. Uh, noah isn't jumping.

49:20

She's just climbing. Yeah she basically grabs a hold of one of the spikes and just throws herself up the wall wounds of their feet and was like, hey, hi.

49:32

Did you ever watch catching tiger hidden? Dragon me. Yes. So your limu buy who just like flew to the top of the wall? She scrambled the climate. Yeah, that's that's how bad looks. They're both. Woo job in their own, right? They're just different muja. Yeah. I mean, just teach like light stepped up every single.

49:55

Yeah, you light body skill and oh, she just jumped straight in the air.

50:06

Uh, the one between you and OG. I assume, yep. See. Now if that multiplied oh gee an invisible blade sticks through that hobgoblin's chest spring you with blood. Yay, before he drops to the ground dead because he had like 12 in feet. Oh no, i was wrong. He had 23 hv.

50:38

And you see that invisible blade like the the blood gets wiped off it and it shits oh i should not be taking joy in this.

50:54

Shall they would be proud? Good point actually. Maybe i just need to channel my inner onto sana. Because she really should be here for this but trying to control all of those NPCs. She is. She's hunting hobgoblins outside like so they can't come into a few back up. Yes.

51:20

Facebook sounds. Chili's just wake up to her the house of withered blossoms, just firing down. It goblets i am fully expecting us to go back if we survive this to shillelugh being sat on top of a mound of corpses like yeah i'm like picturing her right now. I'm thinking like she's just going just full doom guy on just a bunch of goblins.

51:50

Probably. Yes, that's what we'll say. Oh, he did.

51:58

Uh, uh, he can only see ochi in his friend just died. He sends off a volume of ranged attacks. Oh no.

52:19

You are point blank. Now. Yep. The reward for the first one. Is that miss miss miss miss?

52:32

So, as he moves to, to fire his bow, the invisible blade, sinks into him again. And he is so caught off guard, by being stabbed from nowhere, either all of his arrows miss and he has no natural armor. Unfortunately, he still gets six bleed, though. Correct critics. Agree. Cajun Holt are fantastic.

53:01

Now big. Yes. Redfield.

53:12

I wanted to find out bigger and bolder, the first thing i do was made the rift a little bit lower. When you play the riff back lower, it feels more, so she's freedom. It's just maintaining a stream of golden fire on that one, too. He's not having a good day.

53:35

He's been sat by invisible thing. There's fire all up in his space shoko. All right, let's see if we can't, uh,

53:48

All right, so i should be able to get within a range here. Uh, tell me when i would lose sight of this uh, of this one up here, one, like when i get too close to the wall to be no longer able to see them. Oh, you would have to go right up to the square underneath him for that.

54:13

Because he's standing on the edge.

54:18

You didn't even then you're not really going to be out of his range. All right, well no i'm just trying to get as a close to him as i can to a point up to him and say, amen. Just just drop the weapons and and like things will be fine here.

54:40

What do you mean those insufficient charges? It's a spell like ability.

54:48

Uh how do i how do i make it? Make it not say that uh is it? I mean it's still popped off but well yes, but i had to click the spell itself and i want to i want i tried to click so you see how those no leave those gray cog wheels on.

55:10

Are they were they all they were off?

55:16

Why were they all? I don't know. There we go. He's six now and let's pump that up to seven though.

55:29

Boom. All right, he fails on the other hand, you do need to beat it and a charisma. Check to convince this to do something. It wouldn't normally do. Okay, so do i do i just roll straight charisma. Now we charisma off. Here's the hobgoblins. This better be good. Come.

56:04

Dropped her weapons. Put your hands in the air. No one will hurt you. Um,

56:20

He drops his bow. All right. Oh no, he doesn't actually because that is the one that koya. Just put her start knife into.

56:36

Well i i i'm from here on out from from now on shall stop hurting you right koya. You'll stop hurting him. I don't what that work? Or is that just? No, i mean if he is going to surrender,

57:01

We'll see, he drops the bow but he hasn't dropped his other weapons yet. Okay. Oh, gee

57:11

You know what?

57:24

This one has a bow out.

57:31

See, okay.

57:38

Why is my movement doing that?

57:47

Whatever he will do a move behind this. Hob gentleman here. Hop gentle folk and put a sword up to his neck and be like, hey, look your buddy surrendered. Perhaps you'd like to join him. Not killing him because i don't think it makes sense to OG that this one would be getting talked into surrendering and then watch this other one explode with a bunch of swords sticking out of him.

58:15

So he's not going to do the final blow yet knowing the no way. We'll do a stab if he doesn't have to. Uh, can i use an intimidate call out an intimidate? You can certainly use intimidate. Yeah, i mean i'll do. What are they even checks in this game?

58:33

I can't remember anything today. Diplomacy will be the alternative.

58:42

Cute. The check will be a lot higher on diplomacy. He's actively hostiled to you intimidate. Then fair point.

58:54

How's that? I will certainly give him shaken. Is this how you greet visitors? We just want to talk.

59:09

Do they speak common? They do actually speak common tien and goblin. Yeah, i would say we're probably using tea at this point so we'll say tn ntn you, you do not know.

59:28

Monastergaro was going to eat you all. That's pretty rude.

59:37

And we'll call at the endochie's turn. Sorry greason.

59:46

He does nothing. No one attacks him. Kind of just stands there.

01:00:02

This one? Yeah, no one will attack me? Nope, no onions. If you just just uh just listen to me. Drop the weapons. Listen to my voice it'll be fun buddy. I promise.

01:00:25

He's a fox. So it just comes out ring, ding. Ding, ding. Ding, and he's slowly cases.

01:00:39

Back and differences robo voices back. Yeah, that was a good run.

01:00:54

Good morning, start? No, you are getting worse. I mean, i heard it. He said this morning star down, right? I think they called me, i think he called my mother fat and like androphin,

01:01:21

He said this morning star down and then free action, begins crying.

01:01:33

Fastest.

01:01:44

This is where we are now. This is definitely the the way we're at right now, uh, and he will attempt to push, open the door.

01:02:01

It's really hilarious. You should just talk because your target is coming through a completely fine, right now, we could hear all of it, what? Yeah, it comes and goes. It's not continuous robot voice. Just talk the way that the typing was so clear and like windier perfect. God damn it.

01:02:31

Uh, there's no way. Sometimes, it's really terrible, when foundry, does this stuff, and discord does this stuff. But sometimes, it's really hilarious. Sometimes it is very funny. Like, when i am just screaming into the void about like you guys. Don't care about my bird. Of course, we care about ochi.

01:02:51

No OT. Junior? What he named the bird? No, that's not canon. I strike that from the record. I feel like that's canon now like that exists in my head. No, i'm gonna change it. Hold on, let me google some stuff, you know, some stuff. Uh so yeah i'm trying to i'm trying to think exactly how i reacts to you doing this, huh?

01:03:18

Okay, no actually i can probably tell you. Um, so standard action. She actually dismisses her own uh, invisibility. I'm just looks at OG with like the most. You've got to be fucking kidding me but she can possibly muster

01:03:41

You want to let these things left? I mean, i was just trying to see if we could ask him some questions. Clearly, because that's not what that fucking fox is saying over there. I thought it would help. If you saw his friends rendering, we could ask a question. It's just not in Ochie to like have this guy's surrendering and kill his friend right in front of him.

01:04:07

Oh yeah. No you're not. You're gonna be dealing with the person. You're just a closeness person. There's a stink difference here. Um, yeah, let's see. Here, standard action, dismissal free action. To quite literally throw down the wakazashi that she had in her hand off. The wall is just like,

01:04:31

If i get shot again and i end up back there, i'm gonna keep on top of you. That's good. Together hunt, all of you that's all. And it's like i'm i'm not dealing with this shit and i'm doing it. It's kind of fucking make me say i just kind of jumps off the wall and then oh yeah, right there are people attached to the wall.

01:04:59

That's a thing, right? I they're not attached to the wall anymore. The healing that koi gave them, brought them back to full health. So they slid off of the spikes onto the ground, where they collapse in exhaustion. One of them. Did you send the other one was already dead?

01:05:12

No, two of them are alive on the door. One of them is dead, farther down the wall.

01:05:20

Come on. Help. An autumn and she'll try and like drag that guy upright with the rest of kind of improve actions. Like i i'm not dealing with. I tried to me going, i'm i'm not dealing with this right now. I've tried to google what hamtaro means because i wanted to name it like Bert tomorrow, but i'm not finding anything i'm throws.

01:05:41

There's like hamster. Just in general, i was gonna name it like, sora taro.

01:05:52

Raises her hands so that he sees that she's not holding anything bad.

01:06:15

The ball shoko. You get the healing too.

01:06:26

It showcode, you see this hobgoblin. Kind of touch where his wounds were look really confused, then looks up at koya. Like a scared animal.

01:06:41

Might be crying. Oh yeah, this is good. This is the troll in. He's dead.

01:06:53

Um, he is not charmed uh, and screams something in goblin before. He takes his sixth lead damage.

01:07:13

Boom and drops to the wall. Unconscious and bleeding out.

01:07:35

So, unless anyone's going to actually attack this other hop goblin. Uh, so google try and coke some to come out and meet the rest of us. Yeah. Come down, you know, maybe unlock the door on your way in. Oh, gee yells out. This one was not my fault. Grayson, i did not start this one.

01:08:05

Uh he kind of like coils into himself a little bit and scrambles that. So no one's attacking the hop goblin. No, not me, at least. All right, then we're gonna go ahead and and combat.

01:08:20

Gravels down and pulls the bar off of the inside of the doors.

01:08:36

All right, good job. Now, why don't you tell us? Uh, everything your boss has set up to deter intruders, you know, and he traps or ambushes up ahead. Oh gee, where is this happening? Where are you?

01:08:59

What's doing it again? Ochi is gonna walk up and just put a hand on a showcas chest and put a hand on the little goblet and be like hi. I'm ochi sweetie? Oh, rashi son of krakarashi. What is your name in TN? Okay.

01:09:22

Just look over there now. And shrug. What is my name? Mien man. Nice to meet you. I was ready for this, how many layers down does this go? Una. Sukaru's penance goes deep into the earth. She? She bursts us, tortures us. That doesn't sound good and he like touches his wound again and looks over at koya.

01:10:06

Gets that really confused. Look on his face again. We didn't want to hurt you. You attacked us first. I assume there's a bit of duress involved with your defense of this place. But more important question is, how were the only able to escape here? And why is monosukaru still here?

01:10:30

If you don't know, no one's going to hurt you. That's okay. Robo voice.

01:10:44

Uh, better still robo boy better. He looked really near before he said, it's got hurt. You uh, really nervous? Something about her doesn't know.

01:11:09

Grayson, do you still not speak to him?

01:11:14

Uh, no. Okay, i'm just been around me for this whole time when i've learned it, i'm just refreshing myself. Yes, i just want to make sure so that i can relay information as it comes out. Uh, he said that all the stuff that he said, okay, uh, grace and turns to the the hop goblin is like, hey, ugly face.

01:11:37

Do you understand me? He speaks common. I speak the common tongue. Ah, okay. Now, i know, i forgot. I forgot videos that speaks common.

01:11:57

I cannot answer all of your questions but there are others here. Who might many many do not wish to be here? I thought as much are you able to leave? You are very strong. You intend to fight municipal sukaru but we do. We do shall go nods. We intend to kill.

01:12:31

She is the weakest of the five storms, but

01:12:42

To keep the coming from coming in to the pagoda and a muruman, commanded her to stay in the house of where the blossom. Well, the other only fled using something called a kimon. I don't you know what a chemo is. I know it is a gateway of some kind that let them leave probably has to be pretty powerful.

01:13:11

Interesting koya or a vehicle? Do you have any idea what that might be or shoco? He has a role he can make. There's not actually cool thought so special, AP stuff. Special ap staff. Yeah, we have a box, they have a, get out of jail, free card. Um, is the keymon still here?

01:13:36

Yes, the five storms do not dare return to the pagoda lest. They cannot leave again but so long as one of the only remains found here. The kami cannot enter and that's destroyed the keymon or get them back through and trap them into pagoda. Again, i see a rear guard.

01:13:57

Honest. Sakura was she grew bored? A century ago, she birthed Things. She gave birth to many things. That is distressing. What are your number? There are maybe three dozen of hobgoblin, many ogreed like creatures.

01:14:32

I once saw a serpentine woman. There are many genoiani you must be careful.

01:14:48

Can i roll a knowledge on that? Is that knowledge or cannot or plane? No, i only on the general honey. See, give me you're already familiar with them. Am i that's good? It's good to oh she is since i'm on. So the the janoi and the ogre mages are the the goblin and ogre ownie.

01:15:14

On the much larger and more brutal and likely spellgasters great from woman with snake body. Can i determine what he means by that? I,

01:15:38

But don't need it. You might need a few more details than that. Oh okay, i mean we're talking to gaji. Are we talking? Can you describe the snake woman? More to me. Flip up. No. Egg has you guys enjoy? It is a woman's head on a great black, serpent.

01:16:01

All right. Now, can i make a knowledge check? Now, you can make a dollar check. Um, double check what they are actually because they don't remember their separate.

01:16:17

Uh, dunge engineering.

01:16:31

Coco, you are pretty positive that. That's a spirit naga. I didn't see your roles are not public. It's there's no problem. Nice zero. It might be gm. Only. That's one of the options. Yeah. Private gm. Uh i i didn't click anything. I didn't check any of those. I don't think.

01:16:57

Oh, uh yeah. I was curious. So, what do i know about sphere and novice? Oh, so many fun things. So a regular spirit naga. Uh, cast spells is about a seventh level sorcerer uh but they pull those spells from the clerk list as well as those normally available to a sorcerer jesus.

01:17:25

Doodle. They have charming gays, which is as charm person at will, it's just a supernatural ability. They've always got.

01:17:38

Not super fast swimmers but they are pretty fast on land.

01:17:45

They are large, but they only have a reach of five feet.

01:17:53

Actually not a lot. Oh they're poison. Does calm damage and it's actually pretty gnarly poison at the footage save of DC 20. Excuse me.

01:18:09

Uh, their sorcerers and clerics they're quick and they can charm you by looking at. You also poisonous. Uh, don't get. Don't let them boys. Do what's nasty?

01:18:26

Yes, do not let the snake bite you if you would be. So badly seems confused. Yeah, is that you know, you needed to tell people that you've been very helpful and we appreciate that. Is there anything else you think that we should be aware of? And look out for.

01:18:50

We are strong as you said, but we have lost one of our number before and we prefer not to do so. Again, you must pass through the realm of this the swine. Shogun and hill giants. We are. But the vanguard, Beyond here, beyond our place.

01:19:20

That is where you will face her children. You must get past the shrine. The swine. Shoguns palace it leads deeper into the caves. This is huge. Well, i've run out. Tell me does did, uh, did muna sakara know that we are coming of fortifications? Been prepared monosaccharo carries sword, nothing but her penance, and her war with Akinosa her penance.

01:19:59

You've mentioned that before. What do you mean this? She has been building this since she was imprisoned, all of this is carved and cut from her own hands.

01:20:14

Every implement of torture, her device to inflict cruelty.

01:20:21

Her pits to spawn in. He's a very productive sort.

01:20:31

I'm a maroon man. He?

01:20:39

Red with her and many other things, trying to create one of only blood that was indistinguishable from immortal.

01:20:55

Did they succeed? The way is this your mom? He sits the jade throne.

01:21:05

It goes eyes. Become dinner plates. The amounts of offense that you just manage to hit are not his like, she's over here dealing with the, you know, one of these poor guys that has been stoked to the front of this wall, which actually having good. Well, for the first time in her life, you know, she's like, is this gross fucking weirdo?

01:21:33

Your mom. She literally has no words. Um, is doing her very best. Wait, don't you? Yeah clear spots you upside the back of the head as she wanders off to help take care of the the two poor people who were left alive on the gates oh lean into this.

01:21:53

Oh, she rubs the back of his head like an anime main character and says, okay, that's fair. I don't know. You guys all look the same to me except shoko. Anyways, i mean, i get that of no way an omiko.

01:22:12

I don't know what you're carrying to imply about. Listen, you weren't here for a good amount of the bird racism, but there was a lot of bird racism in book, one. Okay, i'm just getting my revenge. So go snaps back to reality before looking around everyone. Yeah. Am i the only one that caught that?

01:22:35

The jade region isn't only. Whoa. Descendant from one, if what our compatriots of mentioned is true. It has to be mortal, right? Yeah. Yes, he is the grandson of, i'mma mama roman Wonderful, i'll follow up under things. I could not give a fuck less about well. Um uh mine name.

01:23:10

I forgot your name. Young beyond. Thank you. Thank you very much. If you cannot leave, we did kill a bunch of drug addicts upstairs? If you'd like to go and wait there because i have a feeling you would be killed for helping us. If you remained anywhere near this stuff, that's about to go down

01:23:36

You are the first being to show me. Kindness in a decade. I will not forget this. We do have applications if you want to come with. Thank you.

01:23:56

Sitting with fires, six arrows into OG's chest.

01:24:05

Uh, now Grayson's come to expect this from ochi at this point. Consider all the people that we have invited to the Caribbean.

01:24:16

You do realize i'm not letting him. Leave a life. You think shillelu is letting him leave a life? I just, you know, man. He didn't have a choice. All right, could relate. Do you think i? Oh, oh wow. Oh, and what the bird on this one, honestly, but the guy doesn't didn't have a choice and what he is or where he was born.

01:24:49

I say we give them a chance. I'm ready for this drama. I'm so this is like telemundo? Right here. Tell you what, how about i rise up? One of those poor innocent people that were stuck to the front of this fucking wall and ask them what they think can appropriate bit of justice would be for what they've done to them.

01:25:11

You know. Um, i'm not above that. Since my word clearly isn't fucking good enough for you. Oh it's fine. Just die. Once sit about in the river of souls for a bit, have a weird conversation with a commie get brought back by said coming over. You do actually have an opinion worth of us?

01:25:33

No, no, never mind just oversinking. Yeah i got it. Thanks not gonna lie to you. This uh, feels like the humans and dwarfs against the less humanoid folk here. Detecting. Oh, she's gonna start the and double A BP. The national association of beastial people.

Don't go looks at ochia and says you realize that he's charmed right now? Oh to not fight us. You didn't make him like us. No, that isn't literally what that fucking magic does. Do you know nothing about consumerase?

01:26:28

All right, dispel it and we'll fight him right now if he still wants to fight.

01:26:39

Uh i don't think i can just toggle it on and off you can end your spell. It's just valuable. I think it has a d on the think. Oh no, it does not. It is not dispelable. Yeah. Oh god all right fine get out of here before they kill you.

01:26:54

Go upstairs. Well, known about 10 hours if he's being truthful. What could he get up to in 10 hours? Oh, she grabs him and flash tips to the stairwell?

01:27:14

Run along.

01:27:21

There. I was gonna give him a clean death or she'll lay a little put, so many fucking arrows in him. It'll look like a porcupine. So, who are these poor folks? You know what you care about? No, no, i'm not racist. Like you guys. All right. All right, let's i'm gonna kill your fucking bird everyone.

01:27:47

Let's just calm down, are they? That's and she'll go. Well, um, approach the the spiked people, the holy ones, Not anymore. Courtesy of Korea.

01:28:12

They will be fine. Are they conscious right now? They are they look dehydrated as fuck in malnourished, still. All right. Oh, she gives them pumpkin seed and sunflower seed. Cardboard. No do not give them that poison. Yeah, he's tengo drinking jug so they can have something to drink.

01:28:41

Gonna just infer. They are more people who are like, kidnapped like the spiders.

01:28:52

If she like, who to growing this guy. All right. No. She is casting something on him after he can sense.

01:29:06

Choco, can you stop big blurry? Giving me a headache. You can have your headache, no way goes into the fortress and slams, the door bars, it essentially. Yeah, she starts being useful because first her alternative right now is be useful or angry.

01:29:37

Don't go too far ahead. Please not only go. As far as i can see, we can't leave these people here. Anyways, they'll never make it out on their own, of course, not.

01:30:01

Oh chi. This is this is all mako next. Oh, and immediately Robo voice of course.

01:30:18

Still give it a second.

01:30:27

Hello. Oh, that's good. I might go laser hands on your shoulder.

01:30:36

I don't know if it's becoming of a samurai poke at someone's weaknesses. So,

01:30:49

Do you mean? No way. No. I mean, you no way is not a samurai or does not aspire to be one. Yeah, though, culturally blinking on who i poking at.

01:31:10

Your comments about her mother. Oh, that's fair. And just in general behavior. She knows that she comes from a bad background. She spends so much time. Beating herself up. People who are supposed to be her friends shouldn't be beating her up to. I will be more mindful. I just he's not hurting us and was very helpful.

01:31:36

I didn't think it right to kill him out, right? It's not right to kill him out, right. But sharing truth with compassion is just as easy as being really honest and one doesn't hurt people unnecessarily. You're right. Lady amiko my apologies. The way i'm sorry, my behavior is not.

01:32:00

You're not told off. All right, then a mako just looks at no way. Now he looks much less patient.

01:32:14

Sorry the the next time you have someone declaring that your backgrounds consists of incredibly famedician evil creatures that are known to eat and consume the perfectly innocent. I'll be sure to to give you the sympathy alongside

01:32:44

My escorts. Oh, she's gonna bow all the way. Genufacting flat be like, no, really? No way. I'm sorry, it was not my place and then yeah. Are these people on the spikes? I've been gonna talk to them. They have names. You, yeah. Shoko was trying to talk to them.

01:33:05

Although, all the telemundo was happening.

01:33:10

Well, let me scroll back. Uh, Dungeon is so long guys. Yeah we'll have to um let's figure out who they are. Get them up and out of here, safely to get back to somebody.

01:33:32

Uh, the woman's name is Lynn and the man's name is gong, all right. Gonna throw up a detector magic in case there's like anything, anything fucky on them. Uh, there is not actually, they actually just look like regular human commoners. All right, and not curse or anything. Okay. Ah, So what's your two stories?

01:34:06

The hub goblins rated our village.

01:34:12

So they can't, i thought they could not now. Not now ochi chocolate races in hand. Finish your story gone. They he came in the night and they said fire to everything. They took dozens of us. We're the last two. At least, they think we are. And they and she kind of like collapses in on herself a little bit when she finally got bored.

01:34:56

It would decorate her walls with us and you fear touch like where her skin is still pink from the wounds. I and it was kind of hard to notice in the the light and in midst combat, but the pink looks like it's in strips of skin. Like someone was slowly skinning them.

01:35:21

Uh, a shred of skin at a time. No, no. I would recognize that. What's that you've been flunked? Yes. Actually, great soco looks at them. And says you're nightmare is over. Now, we'll be going ahead to try and find whoever else we can rescue.

01:35:53

Well, the two are the two of you, all right?

01:35:59

Like the is there. Well, i'm basically looking to see if we can safely. Leave them tucked here while we go on ahead. All right? They're not in any danger of immediately expiring, that does not mean they're safe here. I cannot tell you that circle size, any ideas anyone?

01:36:26

I mean describe this really quick. A broad stone floored courtyard, lights on the other side of the wall, a stone pair bit. Runs behind the arrow slits. The top the wall connected by a wooden bridge that crosses above the door.

01:36:47

We could haul one of them, we could hold them both up the the hole and get them on their way back to the commie,

01:37:01

How much do they look like they weigh?

01:37:06

Uh between the woman probably like one 20. At most. She's fairly skin and bones at this point. Uh, same with the man. So he's probably like around 140. Maybe like they look hella malnourished like they've been here for weeks. All right. Do we have people who are strong enough to climb a rope with one of these two on their backs?

01:37:37

One moment. Please koya, finishes the prayer that she's been saying over the hobgoblin. Who has been waiting patiently? It is your sacred duty and responsibility to see these folk back to a safe place of their choosing. Once you have completed this task, you may go on your road up redemption, if you choose to seek it and i think you will

01:38:18

And he doesn't resist.

01:38:25

And mochi will say a prayer over the one that's deceased over here.

01:38:33

To she's a room this time, specifically

01:38:39

Or shizuru.

01:38:49

Hearing everyone too. I was kind of far away from my mic. Is that better? That's much better. Sorry, is it? Okay, if we take our break here we are at about time that was a pretty intense scene too. For some i've got already drama it taken care of. I might be more than 10 minutes, huh?

01:39:13

That's okay. Let's do a 15 today because i need to make another cup of tea. Brings to this party is the telemundo and just be right. But,

01:39:30

I'll be back, also.

01:50:18

Company chair.

01:51:45

I am lay back.

01:51:56

Oh, hello.

01:52:51

Abby is the whisper box working.

01:52:57

It's per box. Uh, yes. Yes, it is, i install the mod. That let's let's have whisper boxes to each other. If you right click on your, your name, uh, down in the, the bottom left hand corner, is then open with relax, and you can do it for anyone. You want to talk to?

01:53:23

Oh, that's cool.

01:53:30

Interdasting. And what goes on i actually have something i can do here.

01:54:08

All right, no magnet says he's gonna be a little late.

01:54:40

Oh yes, getting right back in. Now, after the the quest is placed upon him, he nuts. And then helps escorts the folks out of the pagoda. I'm quiet since.

01:55:04

A message to shouldlelu to not murder the hobgoblin that's hurting people. Safety.

01:55:16

I haven't decided yet actually we'll listen to the not murder, the hop government party is oh, she walks up behind koya and says i i'm always in all of your wisdom koya. I need to turn the music down just a little bit. Say that one more time. Please, i am in all of your wisdom as always square.

01:55:45

You found a way to help all these people.

01:55:53

You're sweet, but you're still young.

01:56:00

The older. You get the more, it seems to me that not being able to see a path forward is more of failing of the person, then the path.

01:56:29

And then you cannot just like, That's your hat. A little bit though. You might not be that young boy anymore. You're not much taller than you were. How tall do tengo get? I'm about as tall as we do get we um we live slightly shorter lives than human folk do.

01:56:55

So while i may only be 18, we'll call it 18 at this point. I still haven't picked his birthday, but i've reached my adult height in the last couple of years.

01:57:29

I think i was still kind of just like, looking at no way. What found in here?

01:57:43

Several doors. Christening your eyes working in here. Uh, yeah.

01:57:56

Strange.

01:58:03

Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it. Um,

01:58:09

Everything seems really bright.

01:58:15

I'm not sure about the doors, all about for us. Is this one at doors? Well, and in the door. Why is it not a door? It's a door. That's not a door. When is the door? Not a door when it's a jar.

01:58:39

Skipping through a window. God damn business.

01:59:05

I don't actually send this. There you go. Um yes, what is the deal? Doors.

01:59:23

There are two sets of double doors to the north and one, uh, quite solid iron door to beast.

01:59:37

My friend, haven't been nice enough to tell us exactly what these are.

01:59:47

There's no way pulling out part of fucking arrow. From a stonem, they completely forgot about that. He actually would have, told you guys about those rooms he left with, like, with the the people. Uh, don't go into either the northern rooms. Their false rooms decoys. If you go inside after a delayed blades, will erupt from the flooring?

02:00:17

There is nothing in there. The door is on the inside are fake as well. They simply go to more wall, huh? They sound fun? Yeah, very fun.

02:00:32

Great. If you did ask about traps like you recall but i did not give you anything about traps. There are there are traps throughout the entire pendants. Would no ways health. Still be down. Wasn't she inside some channels?

02:00:49

I think for a couple of them she wasn't okay you're just a thought showcode was fully healed up. So, i kind of assumed that you are, too. I know you got a healing here. Like math. Yeah. No. I don't think you were in the range of it channel. Choose too busy.

02:01:13

Having a joyful half conversation trying to rose the, the unconscious people up until you guys came along and decided that no no no, no question. I'm we're done. Interrogating the the torturas now we can talk to fortune.

02:01:36

No. Koi has got numbers today.

02:01:43

No. Thanks to yours ever. Imagine, no way. We should be cautious here.

02:01:59

Well, i thought about that and then i got hit pretty hard and i got mad.

02:02:08

Oh, sleeping off. Uh, no noise hand actually like goes down to so it's like i love my sword one second and then they're just like potatoes off. I'm sure if Grayson's eyes can see anything. A little bit of anything worth finding racing. You don't notice anything trap like on the door, uh, but you do hear i'm gonna say a lot of heavy breathing.

02:02:45

Okay uh yeah he wasn't working for traps. He leaves that to to no way. Um, but uh, yeah, so when you say north, that being all four of those rooms those doors above, okay? You like point it to the left and i thought maybe the north was like, a different direction here.

02:03:05

Like back in the college. Garden map. No. These these are false rooms with traps in them, okay? All four of them just wanted to make sure they're actually just double doors to the same room. Okay. Uh, because it hasn't gotten across quite yet. This place is made for large size creatures.

02:03:32

So uh there's this. Oh, some heavy breathing on the other side, door, quite a bit of it. Oh good. We're talk no joke through this one, too. I'm actually getting a little bit horse.

02:03:53

Oh, a bird and a horse. Mix. That's weird. I've already been accused of racism. Wants too many times today. Thanks. Oh, so i'm picturing a centaur but the the top half is like, oh G. Stop you. It's a pegasus soak your saved. My soul. You know what? I'm thinking, maybe dying was the better option after all.

02:04:18

It's my only card to play.

02:04:26

Would you do the honors of checking for traps? I can check your chops. That's genuinely speaking. I don't think that my eyes are going to be much better at the moment. Which i i mean legitimately because yeah.

02:04:51

No way to. We need to take a moment before we continue. You seem quite out of it.

02:05:01

Oh no, no.

02:05:07

I think i looks very concerned. No, that's fine. It's probably fine, not being. So anyone else buying this? Oh, she's head turns like 45 degrees 90 degrees to the left, like an hour.

02:05:37

Do some hand signals multiply as like, her shadow splits into three. Okay. All right, time to get one shot and

02:05:58

That looks grim. Yeah protest. Carvings of sex gluttony violence and oppression decorate. The walls of this chamber seeming to leap from the walls. Broken bodies of half a dozen humans, their flesh seared and cleansed hang among the vial image.

02:06:27

Oh apparently, she has interesting tastes wonderful. So, uh, how much is the room trapped?

02:06:43

That is that is the question i am asking.

02:06:57

And two combat.

02:07:05

Easily on the ground.

02:07:11

Uh, yep. Definitely. Looks like i forgot to shrink those to a normal size, apologies. It's all right. I assume. I was like these are like 12 foot tall people. They look like they died while waving so. Friendly areas. Royal family books.

02:07:36

And, and we'll say that they actually got a bit closer than that.

02:07:53

And to combat.

02:08:02

That one doesn't have a shot. This one does so an arrow comes flying out of a slit in the wall to the north. I think he's the only one with a shot. Yes. Do you really don't like knowing?

02:08:33

The fates don't like me. Apparently, i did something to piss them off. I don't think it was all those bad deeds i did.

02:08:46

Quite. Yeah, just makes :-(. I think it's just because you're usually in the front. Those. Yeah, occam's razor and whatnot. Yeah. Being what it is. She'll go. It's not back yet.

02:09:10

This an arrow comes flying out of this arrow switch right here.

02:09:29

I'm going to begins. My earlier. Comment still stands. How trapped is this room?

02:09:43

Uh, so that's actually a good question. You rolled quite well. As i recall now that this has begun, uh, you get a hair with them. By the way, you guys. Boom. Boom. This is the trap. Yeah.

02:10:10

But i don't uh looks like a pit trap like the floor. Collapses away. You can just barely make out the seam as you guys go into the room before the arrows. Start flying.

02:10:28

Okay. Uh, okay. He holds his action till someone is within vision.

02:10:42

Christen.

02:10:48

Um, Kind of c2.

02:10:59

So he will uh i guess just fire at one. That you can see he won't spend a key point for an extra shot though Unpause the game.

02:11:22

Uh the first two missed the third will hit but not crit. Fourth will miss fifth will hit, but not

02:11:36

So your arrows, do you reach him but very narrow shot that you're making, but you did pretty pretty well cluster. Your shots. It's very impressive. And then he will also take a five foot step.

02:11:55

That's it.

02:12:04

Remind me, i should have only told Abby where the trap was until she told people. Yeah. Uh, so i'm trying to think of what the most logical way for nowhere to do. This is um what you thinking about doing?

02:12:24

I am not buying that. There is one trap in this room. No, no, it is not buying that. There was one trap in this room. There's that. We do not really you do not set up a trap like a room like this as a. It was a. What's a lot here?

02:12:39

I'm not going to fish in a barrel situation. Um i don't know how this class mechanic like works because hypothetically no i can run across this entire room and not trigger any of them. Very sure. But what i want to know is, can i purposefully trigger them and not get involved in the trap in order to make them visible for my eyes?

02:13:04

So i would say that would depend entirely on the trap. Oh i have returned. My apologies. You made it it's fault traps specifically. I would say that. No, a feels confident in her reflex ability and her general agility that she could easily run across these traps and trigger them and not fall into.

02:13:45

Yeah. So, we're gonna just do that and make this much faster because i'm sure Grayson is going to continue to turret his way to victory. That seems to be happy runs things. Unless of course, again we are going to be in a long protracted conversation with the rest of these fucking hub goblins.

02:14:11

Uh, would you like a perception check? This is like an active seek.

02:14:18

Uh, for more traps. Yes. Yeah, because she is having to squint a little harder and wearing her glasses and you are also trying to spot them. Well, quite a ways out of their radius. Oh, i'm, i'm just gonna have her move like ads from move action. So uh, like to there and this is when you tell me it was one in the middle of the room.

02:14:42

I culture. There's not. There's another one here. Uh, i am desperately. Hoping that 40 something gets it and here.

02:15:00

Oh, They all look like the traps over you, trying. You were trying to trigger this one, right? Yeah, basically reflex save for me. Please. No. Oh, you got to do is not batch you. You say this? I did say this but also wise that you were very confident in your ability.

02:15:23

Oh, you got to do is not much.

02:15:29

I don't believe that. That is almost yeah, you did. You ask what you get for. Okay. So a deep dark hole about 50 feet deep filled with spikes at the bottom opens right here. Everyone.

02:15:50

Yeah.

02:15:54

And no, i can appliance your feet and is like two more to the north and the south here please try not to mumble your way in. Oh, and that one. But i'll do it without when i get to. I believe it is actually a move action to seek. Isn't that?

02:16:09

So, yeah. So,

02:16:16

You can just go up to the door if you want the recorder and cheese like, you know,

02:16:23

Play it smiles and bampths. Do you want me to wait for you to get over here?

02:16:40

No, i would. We do that. I'm just trying to actually, none of the golf goblins have view on her from there.

02:16:51

I put a blind spot in there. Oh, but you're in this dude's range now, and he was holding till he saw someone. Come on. You're not twenties. This is for you. It's a myth.

02:17:05

This is why i rarely ever hold my actions as a gm i often forget them.

02:17:13

Enemies miss. But it takes an image. So one of the shadows takes the arrow. Yeah. You're using shadow cooking. I am mostly remember. It's not like, i thought they naruto boost. They do not. She is, she is not that kind of ninja also. She'll go, welcome back. I heard you come back.

02:17:42

Also seeing coyote all the way to the other side. She teleported right? Or something. He did was lines. Yeah, seeing that she's safe right there. He is. Just gonna go to where she is because he saw that no arrows went into her. I'm assuming right in front of me.

02:18:02

Is this is a big open pit now. Yeah, how do we do? The turns and move and movement? I don't remember how this works.

02:18:28

He's gonna do something like that because i don't know. They no way pointed out this. Nope that's totally fair with like any pointed to an area that certainty, you know what i mean? But uh, so i'm just a roll of reflux saved for me. Yeah, remember what i am there?

02:18:48

So this will be fine. So so ochi comes like trundling just like Bert, nope, that's the wrong one. I mean, bird trendling down hops across this like bounces right here. The greats fall open but he was already midstride and lands over anyways. Like he was never in any form of danger you just like he takes a short step, you know what i mean his foot.

02:19:18

Yeah, so he kind of skids up to the door. Um, and how many feet was that i forgot to measure?

02:19:30

A lot of raven feet. So yeah, that was that was a double move. Um, so ochi's gonna end his turn there.

02:19:47

Guy can only see grace in now. Oh, and kind of shit go. Oh, faith in. Uh, yeah. That hits and confirms are great 20 points of arrow damage. So this hub goblin uh that you cluster shot, uh, setting that you are his doom. Coming upon him drugs the most perfect arrow drive.

02:20:21

He has ever drawn and loses and like scrapes you across your thigh. He actually looks quite shocked. It is his own attack.

02:20:49

Uh grayson, you have plus four to your AC for this. He misses bringing us to shoko. Shoko. The whole party is in a kill box. That's the way i was looking cool. Like, Well, i suppose this time for me to join them up to the edge of this pit.

02:21:27

Carefully towing around.

02:21:33

Until i get about here.

02:21:38

More 50 for 46. Okay. Uh,

02:21:47

And i will throw up.

02:21:54

Throwing up is actually a full round action. You can only free action cry. Or immediate reaction crime. Yes, they have very different tenses and like emotive aspects.

02:22:18

Now, me and Abby are both psychedelic and

02:22:31

Hey, someone's in his view.

02:22:38

Oh, wow. Okay, i mean i guess that's fair.

02:22:54

There we go.

02:23:00

Uh, show go. You have plus four ac against them? Nope.

02:23:10

Oh god, that drum. For attacks are not even a single image pop.

02:23:42

That was a lot, okay.

02:23:50

Thought a lot of damage i mayco used fury attack.

02:23:59

Return favorite works.

02:24:08

This gentleman is going to go ahead and pull attack at no way. Oh, there it is. So, the good news is you don't confirm grit. Uh the other news is dietic both any clones but spare uh you have two more. You said yeah. One day three and then one degree.

02:24:34

Yeah. So the first one hits for seven and then i won the three again because the clone did not pop. Yep. And pop a club power arrows, arrow, straight to the face like just and then just evaporates. Oh, it's a good thing. You're out of reach for their snake attack.

02:25:01

I mean, yeah, they don't have any way to get sneak attack right now.

02:25:08

122 seven more damage arrows. Just firing from murder holes, all around you christen. Uh, because i'll take five foot step first. It is chaotic and bloody in this room i should have put more blood in here and then we'll keep our own at the one he had shut up before.

02:25:50

All right. First arrow. Hits second arrow hits, and here's him.

02:26:02

You have anyone else? Uh yeah. Um he can see just a tip of this one down below him. But oh, so you can all right. Third arrow by one is fit there. Oh, misses

02:26:24

Wow. That's it. Does Grayson's thing, negate cover and concealment unless it's total. Yep. Yeah. So, it's just that precise. That's crazy. Yeah, it is so hard. It's like fun. Then archer is basically. Yeah, it's it's a pretty strong candidate for best marshal because of all the bonuses against. Yeah, he doesn't he doesn't fire an arrow, add something.

02:26:55

He just decides where the arrow goes. Yes, no. Literally. Technically, he could fire an arrow like through one of those meta holes and then hit another goblin. That's true. Yeah. Um, that being said this door, i'm assuming it's a door. It is a door. Gonna open the door or tell me.

02:27:21

It's locked. Uh, that door is not locked. Uh, then get the open. Why is that door? Not a door, uh, because it's a jar. It is now dumb fucking puns. Cool. Everyone see them. Yeah, they have really cool rocks next to him. I they like collecting rocks, right? That's exactly why those are next of yet.

02:28:02

He wants to share his collection with you.

02:28:08

Uh quick description of this room more bio. Carvings and figures decorate. This long corridor. This time depicting acts of envy to the east stone stairs, climb to a balcony lined with pillars. Boom, a stone peloid balcony over. Well, that's where up the two hill. Giants are so a little hard to see from down here.

02:28:37

No way close this door again. I don't have the actions to do that. Um,

02:28:52

But she is going to very seriously. Look at. Okay, both of her currently and be like, i'm going to kill them and you're not going to stop me. I wouldn't dream of it. Good as she fucking disappears. That's so honest. It looks like she's seriously considering closing the door.

02:29:38

Yeah. That's what she's gonna do. Nope, that's personal.

02:29:57

Clear points. Their hand and chains of starlight erupt in constellation.

02:30:12

Uh, bind him in place and lock him to the ground.

02:30:26

Oh, i didn't expect that to work. I've never used that spell before.

02:30:34

Oh no. She probably put steps out of rock throwing range, huh? It's a reflex save to break free of chains. Change of light. Yeah. Yeah.

02:30:52

That there are cereal anchors. Saving through each round, huh? Yep. Because the idea is that this is supposed to be used against creatures that are capable of various into planets. You know, enter planner teleports. So the idea is, they're probably resisting that and trying to but you keep making new chance, unlocking them.

02:31:17

It's pretty fun. Uh, he's paralyzed. Oh, gee

02:31:26

Free action. Begin crying, move action, and closes the door. I don't know.

02:31:37

Um,

02:31:41

You know, i think oh, she's gonna oh gee. I mean, you're just going to shut us back in with the murderer goblins. I mean, i might take you in the pace if you close the door, might think about kicking you the head. He's gonna.

02:32:05

We're going to move at least that far so we can see our murder will friends and then yeah, gonna keep going. Get up to this buddy and do a step.

02:32:22

He can be fully in that square now.

02:32:28

Evil, right? We determined, yes. Stab boom. Step is success.

02:32:43

That will be OG's turn.

02:32:48

Um, he's dead.

02:33:02

Um,

02:33:07

Rock throw. I'm sorry that can't be right.

02:33:22

Oh nope. They only have a plus six to throwing rocks. We're about to say like, no that that seems right. They have low accuracy but they hit like well boulders. Yeah, boom. So yeah, big ass rock bands. Next to you ochi perfect, they don't actually hit that hard. That was a max roll for them.

02:33:49

I don't want to take a boulder to the chest cavity. I don't think anyone really does shadow back miss miss. He's going to fight footstep out of vision range of the room shooko. Oh, shoko will go to the column that no way was in because he knows that column is sick.

02:34:20

Wait, no, no, he knows a you knows that this column is safe. And then uh uh take a running leap to get across uh that would Careful, coy is gonna cast featherfall and pull the boss.

02:34:43

Deserve it for me to undo movement. So that like they calculates correctly controls it? Yeah, control z.

02:34:55

Okay.

02:35:14

Second a second to load for some reason. That's all right. I'm looking forward to this acrobatics check.

02:35:24

Well, i just need to jump 10 feet, right?

02:35:30

15. I don't think i'm gonna make that jump. Uh, so we're just gonna oh oh, but you ran for that jump.

02:35:47

Uh, i i don't go skids to a stop like right here. Like nope, change my mind. Yeah. Yeah, we'll go with that. Oh okay. 40 feet movement to get in here. And then another, i think i will double roof. Five. Ten.

02:36:23

Start making my way up here towards these marker rolls.

02:36:51

He can't see anyone there.

02:36:59

You can't see anyone there.

02:37:05

You know, double move up.

02:37:12

Still can barely see you.

02:37:18

You do.

02:37:24

Charge. There's a charge. Never mind, does it? What nothing? Don't think a 22 hits you though. That does not. I may go, i can't see in the dark. You're all asshole.

02:37:55

Slowly starts picking her way towards the light. You can blame on. What do you mean the lights pretty bright?

02:38:08

It was completely dark by the other door, it's not okay. Well it's not completely dark but it's still sucked. Okay, just suddenly being in the dark with arrows. Flying everywhere.

02:38:31

She makes it all the way and next time, i'll lend you you to, and then he can hold your hand. Huh. Weigh-in is and so, actually, i might like you two better. What indignant monkey noises, okay? What is your cmd?

02:38:58

It is 30. You get in the deck of opportunity. Oh, this hot goblin. Fucking flips down the hallway to get to the other side of you.

02:39:21

Oh, very nice. Okay, so that triggers here. So you get to move before he's out of the square. I'm gonna trade spots with where he used to be. I can't you're gonna have to move me. I would like, yes i would like to be there and then i will poke him turn on free movement.

02:40:03

That works. It's not exactly what he wanted, but post enough, uh, you stick him as he tries to be smooth and graceful and you prove yourself the far superior acrobat, which is not surprising. He has a hop goblin, uh, but he's still swings his morning start at you. And misses, it's good enough for me.

02:40:43

Hello there, friend.

02:40:52

Nope, christen Uh seeing the the groups move forward, quite a bit Grayson's. Going to move move to right in front right in the doorway there.

02:41:16

Uh in hearing uchi to the south and seeing shoko go to the north. He'll take a shot at the southern hill. Jump.

02:41:36

Uh once again this is the the perfect strike so it's only one attack but it uses whichever is the highest attack roll. Boom. You land an arrow square in his torso. And then screams, he screams even louder, all right? And that's it. Know it cool. If you want to just handle that one for a migration.

02:42:05

Thank you. Oh, sure. Yeah because as i know i like shifts up to that and this is where i get to so pull around actions, you can split them into two standards, right?

02:42:27

Hey, you can't. I'm sure if you ask me, no, your real body.

02:42:40

Yeah, you can flip them around. Cool crew to grow. Okay, it might still survive the kudograph but we'll see brain to increase about. It's okay though, only one hits.

02:43:30

All right, he gets to make another reflex. Save, i hate you. I cannot fucking believe this. Actually the one time i actually get to do something that's like kind of thing like, yeah, sure. Whatever. It's not like dc21 though. Yes. But it's still a natural 20 so it's literally what he has to roll to break free.

02:43:57

Oh my gosh. Yeah. Well

02:44:04

So, you know, i was going to be actually pretty nice about this and like make it as clean and quick and as painless as she possibly can. Now, she can't. Ah, when did they make that again?

02:44:23

Each round to end the effect. So at the beginning, yeah turn. Yeah, that's what i got for being nice. Okay, fine. It's not.

02:44:40

We'll say that was a standard action for him to break free though. All right, so that he'll change just wrenches free of these chains of lights sending constellations shattering across the ground ochi, okay? You're in a hot goblin sandwich or at least you're about to be yes. So, we are going to

02:45:17

He's gonna say your friend first venue. And that's his challenge. And then we're pretty challenging this one. Yes, we're in a full attack. Starting with uh the still alive one, all of them are still alive, okay? All right.

02:45:48

So first attack hopefully drops the one that i've been attacking and if so continue it's not. It does not. What about the second one does that, boom. The second one does it get? Hold on. So plus three is on your first attack, not your second attack. There should be no pluses.

02:46:14

Okay? So it is just the 19, the hit. Uh, yes and that unfortunately misses okay by one

02:46:31

Oh, she's turn. Key is dead.

02:46:41

This one screams dwarf.

02:46:53

And runs up to creation, swinging his club and misses which hits the stone with a thunderous.

02:47:09

Where the blossom?

02:47:18

Charge.

02:47:27

Let's do her blinking, a hit a 32 hit and

02:47:41

13 points of damage in total. As you feel the hop goblin swing with skill and precision that. I'll do it shoko.

02:47:59

Uh,

02:48:03

Broker will stay where he is and full attack on this goblin.

02:48:12

You can do it, put your back into it. I finally figured out. Oh, my shoko hip my movement was still so quickly on me. I've had the us. How's that? How's that for a foreign?

02:48:31

It does actually.

02:48:36

I'm so sorry. Oh, gee. No, you're fine. I have the difficult terrain button on since the webs. I think. Oh no sorry so what was your question? I, my movement has been counting for way less and i couldn't figure out why i had the consider distance with difficult, terrain button on since the spiders, i believe, oh, i couldn't figure it out.

02:49:01

I was like in my encumbered. What the hell's going on? Well, it's off now, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Boom. Wait, was i doing the same thing? I think i was doing the same thing. Yeah, it's the little uh, hiker icon below the ruler. So she'll go. You're at your waveblade cuts deeply into this hop goblin finding its way through rather.

02:49:39

Was that if you turn? Yeah, that's it.

02:49:45

With their blossom, warrior.

02:50:03

Exploding star.

02:50:08

Uh yeah, that'll do it.

02:50:14

I'm sorry, you were a robot all throughout that. Have any images. Do you have left? Three, uh, four. I have a bit hit once but you refresh since the wall. Yeah. Yeah.

02:50:33

You lose an image. These half gallons seem much better with, they're melee weapons, and they are with their arranged weapons. I think you have that the other way around, but i mean in the fact that they nearly dropped like they did like half of no way's health in a single round with their range weapons.

02:50:56

Yeah, going great with me right? Yeah but that's me and i got quite close. Yeah i i just quit Abby that's how things go. That's not a as long as reliable data sample. I know sukio likes me but like, could the prince lay off for like five fucking minutes?

02:51:21

First bone that only rolled one of his attacks and the second one is i believe is 27 also misses

02:51:35

Ochi. I am so sorry. Yeah, both of those attacks. Miss. Yeah you know what? It's just gonna fire up a not. Oh my god. Oh, okay.

02:52:11

I'm michael just stairs blankly as her flames kind of sputter and flicker and just hit the stairs, nowhere near their target.

02:52:28

But still per blinking, i don't think either of those hit either.

02:52:39

Boom. Boom.

02:52:55

Oh, shoko taken Zack opportunity.

02:53:03

Against this one.

02:53:10

22 will hit.

02:53:28

Single attack that'll hit. Oh, roll the popping image about three left. So you know, d4 roll one d4 for an image is destroyed. Let me shatters it.

02:53:50

Bringing us to Grayson. It's gonna try to take this pill giant down.

02:54:04

Oh, he did.

02:54:12

The boop poop.

02:54:24

Yeah, third arrow, finishes him. All right. And then i'll have the worth and fifth group at the hobbing hair. That's flinking with sugar all righty. He goes down as well. All right, check it five foot step and that's it racist arrows. Flying in every direction finishing off enemy after enemy.

02:54:56

No way he's doing the the grace and thing you really did. Yep. And he was hit by a critical jesus christ. Yep. Uh boop, you happen to speak. Giant. Dear boop. Boop. Oh me. Yeah. Uh, then you have the pleasure of hearing normally quite loudly saying. I am so sorry about this a genuinely.

02:55:31

And then just uh that um that doesn't feel nice three. I it cuts quite deeply into him. He is still alive but only barely. No, he's not. Oh yes. Nobody's first attacks. Pretty much carved giant stretches of meat out of his torso. And he goes to a knee with a rugged gas, but he remains alive and no age just finishes them off in what?

02:56:09

Fashion. How would you like to do this? Uh, not that any of you can say, but very on, like, the side of this giant's face, there is like a blood print that just appears. And she's like, i'm so sorry as this knife goes smoothly into the side of its throat and just skims across like another hot knife through butter.

02:56:32

Wild.

02:56:40

Then you see yeah, like two footprints move out of the blood then it's like, whoops.

02:57:01

Well at least i'm good at violence. Oh, i thought if talk is a free action then choco will say i've got this one go help out cheat

02:57:24

18 points of healing for shoco omeco and racing play ahead damage. So she's and then hill giant ochi. We're going to try and do what we did again last time. There's some like uncomfortable stuff happening over in this hallway. We're gonna spend a key point to do some more text.

02:58:03

Bug him up.

02:58:12

First attack hits drops him. Okay. Second attack is going to the southern one.

02:58:23

Deeply into him. That is the one that i challenge. So it has the nine additional damage on top of the 23. Like, it's not. And then the last attack at the southern one, as well, your first strike bloodied him. Your second one almost brings him down.

02:58:48

And that's going to be OG's, turn.

02:58:54

He said he's dead.

02:59:02

This one snarls and anger.

02:59:07

Boom. They've clearly lost their focuses. Now they can't seem to hit you at all anymore. Choco.

02:59:20

Uh yeah, i will just keep wailing on the one in front of me.

02:59:31

Okay, significantly worse than the last few times. Uh, the first one still hits, though. All right.

02:59:41

Then i will five foot step back. You give him like a little bit of a cut.

02:59:49

And then it's his turn.

02:59:55

And he, by foot steps up.

03:00:00

And misses. Yep. He callously steps on the body of his friend. Oh well as a reaction i can. Um i i need to i need to remember to do this more uh of parry. Can i all right? No, it's too late for me to say that gone. I mean he also missed.

03:00:25

Yeah. You want to parry and repost i was going to. Yeah, but i forgot about it. So, go on without me. Okay, he did a bunch of missing two.

03:01:03

Sort of ducks out of the way, is a bunch of flashing lights dart over his head, Look like the right amount of damage. Oh no, he was a full health. He only. And then once. Okay. Nope, that's the right damage then uh he's dead. He's dead. Grayson uh, well head.

03:01:32

So, and which of the two that he can see here. Looks more injured. The one closest to you, looks like he's barely standing. All right, we'll take one shot on him.

03:01:58

Uh, it's the the perfect strike thing again. So whichever is the highest, uh, that would be the crit. So technically when it crits it uses the second highest as the confirm rule, which only reduces the confirmed by one yet. So it's it's still confirms. Um, you, how do you want to do this?

03:02:18

Uh, i mean, he's probably so focused on on uchi right now that, uh, just doesn't see an arrow kind of maybe like embeds and, uh, like his shoulder, uh, hard enough that he just crumpled to the ground.

03:02:36

No way. God that looks so cool. With the effects. You have on right now. The major armor and the invisibility it's it's a lot. It is a lot but it looks cool. It sure is. Yo, it's the server is running smoother. It is doing indeed that.

03:03:05

Now, if only i would stop getting robot voice. Yeah, robot voice. I i did i i would also like a an image or shoko at some point whenever though, whenever that's right. Yeah, shoko has an image. You know, it does for me, for me, my token, this entire time, has been the, the hooded white figure, you know, the default.

03:03:31

That's it's fine. Interesting is weird here. Let me try applying your prototype token again.

03:03:47

Nest. Still the same. Yeah, i'm gonna make you want to make those like neat transparent ones as well soon. You're all try reloading.

03:04:03

Maybe you changed it. Uh, in between when i first got on

03:04:11

Annoying. You're welcome hashi, cuts deep but he is still standing though. Blood. Now spurts from various wounds on him. Oh, i'm sorry cat. I didn't know you were asleep there. You know, that's where my feet go. Right. How could you? She was sleeping there. Oh well she doesn't seem to mind.

03:04:31

She's hugging my foot now. So i i'm a space heater. I think that's why my animals are always cuddling with me, uh, but it also means i get hot really easily by. Don't always like all of my animals kept with me.

03:04:51

Better foodstep now. All right range. Now now i am it. Now, i am a fox.

03:05:01

Baby boom. My dog stepdaughter. Um, likes to stand in doorways. She's a guardian of gateways, it's interiorating. Every time i try and go anywhere. She's like, where we're going. I'm like, nowhere. Get all the way. I'll do a stab. Oh, it is your turn. I was like getting ready to do the warrior blossoms.

03:05:29

Turn idiom.

03:05:36

Both of those hit. He is still standing but barely, uh, that'll be my turn.

03:05:54

He gets one final strike, he swings screaming with all of his might and failing. Ashoko is half government in front of you is now gushing blood out of a wound from an invisible blade. By the way. Oh, i apologize for my friends here. Let me see if i can help you with that.

03:06:27

You fucking suck your bad, like see if i can help you with that step. Your second attack brings him down. How do you want to do it?

03:06:48

Uh, into the big giant gaping wound. That no, i made and then twist and pull. There's a violence eruption of blood as no way. Primarily targets, arterial areas uh to encourage blood clustering, her attacks, and you just wrench that artery the rest been and he bleeds out in moments.

03:07:17

You know, it right now because she has a very mixed face. By the way, is everyone liking this? This narrative ship that i'm using. Oh, it's quite nice. I like it. This is one of the reasons i wanted to cut back on the number of games i had because i feel like i was starting to lose my narrative abilities.

03:07:43

I feel it again. You know, i'm here for the television. Oh yeah, that's it. But tell the window. Dead dead crazy. Oh no. I may go my initiative tracker, huh? I don't i no longer have a little initiative pop-up that i could just click to go to the next turn, right?

03:08:10

Click the initiative. Tracker the on the right next i can. Okay, go see him smaller than it, used to be used to be the length of the initiative tracker and now it's like condensed. I don't need beer. There's a flower in the bottom brown that you should be able to use it.

03:08:27

Oh i thought that just like fully expanded. It's totally. So i'll make a slides around the corner, firing off more of the golden blue bolts of power, basically bludgeon him to death. Abby, what do you not know?

03:08:55

That's a big question. The word for epoxy. I could have fucking just for taking my own brain over that. Okay, so real quick before, we get too much further ahead. Now, um, all of these hobgoblins are wearing very nice equipment that they are. They are all caring with them.

03:09:24

Masterwork heavy wooden shields, masterwork composite long. Bows, masterwork morning, stars, mass, work, till maru, and a potion.

03:09:43

All right. Who's got the bag of holding prettiest. Thanks, uh, yeah, i thought it was kind of a understood like Grayson was the bank of avidar.

03:10:00

But this does way a lot what size bag of holding, do we got going on now? Uh, the largest one. Take four. Oh, wonderful. Yeah, you did craft a big one. I have one. Well, everyone kind of needs it for themselves as well, eventually. And now he's gonna mana one.

03:10:21

But uh, just as a side note actress after, after witnessing that, uh it's got a very flatly, like both of her like one, one of them that looks to the other with this disconcerted face and then both of them simultaneously, this kind of turn to show go. So what makes that of goblin that you let loose different from these ones.

03:10:57

Oh, nothing at all. Oh, I'm not i'm not look i can be merciful but i'm a realist. No way. If it's too, if it's if it puts anyone at risk to let one of them loose that i'm not good to try it. That one was alone unarmed armed and what?

03:11:20

And then whatever coya did to him. And i read that even outside of my charm magic, he seemed to have a genuine change of heart. Now of course maybe if i sat down and talked to this one, he bras the course of his foot, i could have gone the same amount of them but i'm a bodyguard to princess on my go first.

03:11:48

Shoko is the god of the world of hobgoblins in this place, christen. I see that you were up on the balcony of pillars, a stone pillared balcony. Overlooks. The room below the columns decorated revolting. Scenes of mobile voice. Revolting. Scenes of. That's what we got violence with revolting scenes of vice and violent.

03:12:21

Oh, i got a random question. Uh, guess we'll go up and i'll inspect him. Do they look like they were carved by hand or do they look like they were formed by? I don't know magic or something. They look like they were carved by hand. And while they do depict grotesque scenes, the artistry of the person made them and i'm giving this to you because it's still working here.

03:12:50

It's uh the artists that made them has a real passion for the subject matters. Hmm. Okay? Like these scenes were all fashioned lovingly with care and muna sukaru. Yeah. Muna sukaru. Is the hobgoblin, who's name? I forgot told us that they made this whole place.

03:13:21

They love sin.

03:13:28

No.

03:13:45

Truly an evil place.

03:13:51

I mean, i never really thought that shih tzu would lock away the only for no good reason. But seeing this place. If this is what one of them is like, the least of them, both of your jars are jars. What your doors are not doors. Oh,

03:14:24

That's the only door out of the, the wall, by out of the initial area. By the way, only effective one, the four at the top were false. We retroactively gained that knowledge from our goblin friend. They were fake rooms with blade traps on the floor. That activated. I don't delay with nowhere to go.

03:14:45

Yeah, so this is the only path forward Heads or tails my friends unless someone has some kind of divination on which way books us all the coin out of her pocket. Always tails for me now dough. Maru is the armor. Oh yes. The domara ash m, a r u, m a r u network.

03:15:17

So uh and there were 11 sets in total uh there would have been 12 but you let one of the hop goblins, go and coyot had him pick up his weapons so that he could protect the villagers. Okay, as he was under a gayest to protect them. Mmm. Yes.

03:15:40

He is serving his penance. I should be canceled for it but every time i see gias or gas, all i can think is gay ass. That's all i can think. Yeah i do too in the back of my mind somewhere. I was also a teen boy at one time.

03:15:56

Yes.

03:16:01

When, when we were back in ravens cracked all the, the blood gyosses on everyone, just bloody ass every time bloody gas everywhere. Yeah, that's fucking terrible. All right. Um, no one's heard of lube. Yeah, for real. Come on the frozen north. I suppose can't survive. They don't have the ability to.

03:16:29

No, they had oil for sure. They had kinds of oil. It's all like you know tallow and whale blubber and hmm, door open. The courts. Fantastic ahead. And many giants in this place. I'm sorry, i forgot to shrink the body, you know, it's just funny. Just like, okay, the hallway of endless agonies broken bodies, some of which seem to have died where they were tormented line, the walls of this long arch arched corridor amid carvings and figures of torture and anguish.

03:17:15

You're almost noise. So, leave sir with the side it comes out, just like, oh she closes the door and we go to the other one, which is the olive endless, rainbows and happiness, evil all the way down here, isn't it? Rotten lemish on the jade forest. It's the forest of spirits.

03:17:43

That's right. The jade forest, is a world of warcraft zone. I got that completely wrong. So the the corpse in front of you twitches slightly which is in still alive or twitches in roar, i'm a zombie. Uh, twitches in that moments later. A jade green spirit rises from it.

03:18:09

Oh here we go. Her face twisted in pain and vengeance.

03:18:18

Against me vengeance.

03:18:25

Take me with you. This wasn't the a gentleman named out front, right? That killed you because i have bad news. Ohness sucaru. Oh, okay. That's yeah. You could do that one. Honorable samurai take me with you neck. You cut out a little bit. I'm sorry, take me with you.

03:18:51

What to enact my revenge so that i may rest it.

03:19:01

Hmm. Shoko. Do you have any advice? Do i happen to do any advice? Would that be a? Maybe a skill check or something? Acknowledge check of some sort. Perhaps or for what you've already encountered. Plenty of spirits? Yeah. Fine fine. Oh, g says, i will do this for you.

03:19:27

The neutral. Good, female human, kasutsu, yuca. The soul of unending misery, wrenches herself free from her broken tormented body, and settles into your own mind. And while you feel her thirst for vengeance for her just this list death, she grants unto you are still mind, monk classability. Oh hell yeah, a plus two bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells and effects so long as youka possesses you.

03:20:03

What is that? What? What type of bonus like enhancement? It's just a plus. Two height. Still mind is awesome. I'll be handy for the naga fucking pasture and is like, oh yeah, sure. Fucking vengeance possess you.

03:20:33

No way. Grab the fucking still mind feature real quick.

03:20:41

It's okay you can tell me that like the body is trying to kill me in a second. It's time actually. Nothing else budges. There actually does note the light kind of filtering, like, what was going on down here? So through there, you can see a vast cavern, a hundred feeling and in it.

03:21:06

Hold on. Let me scroll down. You see a stone keep sitting on an outcropping of rock in the belly of this huge cavern, several of its walls of clearly seen better days. The structure sags in places and just a rubble line that keeps flings from the building's roof, which almost touches the ceiling of the cavern itself.

03:21:30

You see a stone bridge that arches across to a previous rock outcropping, high above the cavern floor.

03:21:43

Oh, but not from that angle, if you're sending here, you can see the yeah, that's done. Keep, which is over here. I guess you can't really see the bridge from there, but from where you are, you're almost like, even with the, the roof of the keep that you can see through this arrow slit.

03:22:14

Any idea, what is then?

03:22:19

I imagine that's where our target is. Which one?

03:22:29

Oh, if you're talking about sukaru and the bonsai tree. Oh no.

03:22:42

You once we're paying attention to your own interrogation. Won't you? And that is literally all no excess and keeps walking because i take it. That gap is like an hour slick kind of thing. It's not. It is an arrow slate. Yes. You are not fitting through there. Yeah, a tiny creature.

03:22:59

Can squeeze through there. I do not feel like sending my precious bunny out into somewhere where it's going to be clobbered by more hobgoblins. No, thank you. I won't be going through that arrow slit by myself. No, thank you. Even if you ask me to, i don't want to It's important to add boundaries, you too quite so

03:23:29

I am not a scout. I am necessary. You are you want to guidance? I don't want my eyes to fucking work. Oh,

03:23:49

I don't know if they're gonna work like you had them working before you've got a whole new body.

03:23:59

So what's the deal here, then? Hold on.

03:24:09

All right, so you come up to a ledge that descends into the darkness. 80 feet below with a letter attached to the side of the wall. You hear a waterfall coming from beneath you and you can see the fires of hobgoblins near the bottom And from your angle you can see them just fine.

03:24:39

They do not seem to have noticed you though. They seem to be working in a kitchen of some sort over here. Everyone see that.

03:24:52

But they are 80 feet down.

03:25:03

Is this the same height? That is a waterfall that descends 80 feet down to a shallow pool, so that top part is higher than the rest and then, yes, it's up by you. This is a pool and all this is roughly the same altitude automation. Yeah. Uh looking at the with the the floor changes like the stomach and such does it look like this was intended or like they broke through a wall or something?

03:25:37

It looks like they broke into a cavern and then put up some walls like they found a natural cave lefted the way it was and just sort of started depositing hop goblins in here. This is the ladder correct over here, correct.

03:26:02

Welcome. But to be fair, you do have. I will give him since he's by the door. A perception jack.

03:26:20

No one notices, the lights you guys have up there.

03:26:27

So how do we want to handle this?

03:26:34

All right, who's hot goblins? Do not look like the withered blossom. Warriors fighting. Don't look as heavily muscled or armed.

03:26:48

I think these are just chefs or well, at least what passes for a chef of however, many feet below the ground. We are you want to ask them for cooking tips? Don't ask them what they're cooking.

03:27:10

Can you smell what those rocks? Are cooking. I i don't i i do want to put this out here shoko. I gave you a hobgoblin on the redemption because you old really well on your check and they had literally never been taught kindness. But for the most part, these are evil fucking terrible creatures.

03:27:27

Yeah, i gave you one everybody in this kitchen makes me feel bad but i think i've got to do it if they're not as armored and they're not okay, walks over and picks up a mako. Uh like will you pick up a cat? Will you grab its front legs and it's back legs.

03:27:52

And you make it like a machine gun and points her at the hobbins and cocks her. I don't think we do it exactly that way. Oh, mako puts the fireball up against. Oh she's head and just leaves it there. Wait hold on, hold on. One dodge this motherfucker babe.

03:28:12

Can you not love him up when i'm literally here? I really don't want to fall. 80 feet of a fucking lunch. Oh geez light eyebrow rays at that freezing uh before shoko breaks out the drums and sets to work. They're not as well under skilled i can probably deal with them.

03:28:33

What are you doing? Sugar.

03:28:36

Three seconds later carry on says, it's out of ammunition. What look, it says the drums are out of ammunition when i tried to use them well coming, all right. Yeah. So it should melt because it's yeah. Uh so grace speaks up finally. He's like so we oh it doesn't really clicked on.

03:29:02

Yeah, it's off. Oh, so we're we're not gonna let them go. So they can raid innocence and and local. Uh trade caravans and it gives a ochia a bit of a wink. I go ahead, choco. It's to be working. Now, this has a 100 foot plus 10 feet per level of reach.

03:29:25

So yes, i was about to say no i was already halfway down the fucking canyon. The moment you do that like, oh, i see no, no, a great big image of a massive tyco drum appears behind shogo, but he begins to beat upon with electrified beaters. And then as electricity starts gathering around, these hobgoblins did mean to say that you will have to adjust the castor level in the spell of average.

03:30:08

Okay, apology, crazy. It won't let me roll a cmb check on gracing the bushing off the cliff, but i tried clicking it in several places on my sheet and it just won't do it. Lucky for me. You, you don't beat my cmd. No, i definitely don't. But uh shoko.

03:30:30

What is your caster level? Uh, ten. No, it's got the formula in there. Hmm. Stranger wait, minimum barred level maybe um, yes functions. Yeah, pasta level equal to your barred level, but half of electricity and the other half is not subject to any energy. Your reflex save though.

03:31:04

Also has a nuke? Yeah. Okay, costume of it to do it, but yeah, charisma of x. So your reflex save is 21. So, i'm going to Restore those points. Okay. Do. It's one more time. It should be working. Now here your challenges back as well. I already did. I'll be right back.

03:31:41

I need to check on my son. Say hello to the baby. That is not the right template. No one is not.

03:31:57

Also, that's a lot less damage than us expecting. I guess it's a lot. Oh, that's a lot of ones twos and threes. That's why.

03:32:10

Uh, crap. It's a 10 foot verse radios. Is it? 10 foot. Yeah. It's yeah. All right. 10 foot radius. Yeah. Comfort radius. 40 foot column. Yeah, so you can hit these four.

03:32:47

Okay, we are going in very loud wanted, uh, very loud. Tis of drumming flame. Strike drums, drums, drums. Uh, you do have a full round to get down there though because it takes them that long to do it. If you warn mere. Yeah, you just said you started pounding the drums, you didn't tell anyone what you were.

03:33:13

So, three of those hobgoblins just die out, right?

03:33:23

Boom. So how are they included in your defense? Excuseoko.

03:33:37

They're no comment threats to princess and well, i don't think they would have been in the first place and half damage to that one.

03:33:52

Get rid of those ones. Abby i am willing. Sorry app. Uh, no way thing. Good. Anything.

03:34:05

No. I have full willing to argue the ethics of all this after we are done today. Sure. And if i die again before i get an answer that i actually think is worth of them instead of you talking around shit. Oh, that'd be very disappointing.

03:34:30

So, as the flame strike, it's the kitchen.

03:34:39

Three of the hop goblins are centered immediately because they are normal hobgoblins with 17 hp. A terrified shriek goes up in the cavern the drums echoing and the cavernous walls. Barely heard over the thunderous roar of the waterfall and then you hear the whooping. And shrinking sounds of many, many more hobgoblins coming from down this way.

03:35:11

I would have been very loud actually. So, yeah, i know, it would have been wincing the entire times. It's like okay and you see hub goblins pouring out of tense in the darkness.

03:35:32

See if i can make them all visible. I can.

03:35:42

I and that's where we're gonna call it for this week.

03:35:48

Oh, that sounds good. Uh, Hi, everyone. Feel about today's game. I love the drama.

03:36:07

Yeah, enough like the drama. Uh, i know ochie's checking on his kid. Sorry, i'm here. Though, we are calling here. Oh, i'm sorry. As the as a, the rule dozen more hobgoblins appear out of tents. Hooping and hollering in the darkness. Yeah, there's a at least a few of them.

03:36:43

Plan cleanly. And now instead they get to what try I mean, i'm just saying i wasn't really expecting the drums in the flame strain. I'm gonna be realized i was looking for an excuse to use that the entire session. Just like, look what i can do, but the whole cabin awakens.

03:37:13

Yeah. Yeah. But i will describe this cavern now for you guys as well. Um, the great cavern, strange hobbles construction from a sorted debris clutter the floor. Vast natural. Cavern a large waterfall, crashes, and pool along the north wall. While a deep pit runs through the southern portion of the cavern bridge by two stone arch.

03:37:41

So large is this chamber that a small stone. Keep has been constructed far away in the gloom, which you saw through the arrows, freshly fallen, rocks litter. The floor of the cab fusion of animal droppings and fungi. I don't know if you guys can actually see the mushrooms better everywhere.

03:38:05

Yeah, i covered the walls with them. The chicken of the underground. It really is. It is their primary food source. Actually uh, along with they got that arena, they got that infinite food glitch, they shit in the corner and then it throws so much trouble. Gross. But not untrue for hop goblins.

03:38:32

I was thinking about it but it seems like the, i don't know, the drama or whatever you want to call it from today, seems to still be the same one from way back. When from the original tension between Grayson and ochi on, it's still the goblining them go or not, it wasn't even me this time.

03:38:55

It was one hundred percent yoga. I know it's just the like that same topics seems to keep coming up over and over again for for a group. It's true. Maybe the group needs to have a pow. Wow, about what they want to do with individuals.

03:39:17

I mean, obviously, right now is not a great time with the hobgoblins everywhere, what? She's gonna lose his power in powers. Man you guys keep making him kill people who are like unarmed and surrendering. Oh she doesn't have paladin powers though. What do you think? She's a palette palette of the samurai code.

03:39:37

She's supposed, that's great. I like that. Yeah, i don't know what's the actual consequences of an alignment shift, our further character, who has zero alignment requirements. So yeah, it could be bad. Doesn't necessarily mean it will be though. Yeah. This is going to be fun room though. Super funny.

03:40:00

Not for you. Yeah, but i, i was not really expecting the, the math attack was so many sneaky characters. This is an entire party of lightly armored sneaky characters and you still go, boom. Yes. Hey, check this out. He just said, hold my box here. He literally saved one of these hobgoblins, right?

03:40:28

And then he sees these ones, he's like, hey, check this out. Watch this it's half. The reason why i'm having so much fun with no edges being like, you people are fucking psychopathic because you don't actually adhere to one thing about what you want to do, which is why she's constantly second-assing about like whether or not she's supposed to murder the shit out of these things.

03:40:53

Or not. I'm gonna blame my own diagnosed ADHD on ogd and bird. The bounce sort of stuff because like i know how ochi should act i just can't act. Right. That's that's fine. Follow in each year. So, But that's it for today. That is it for today. I mean, you killed a bunch of hot goblin.

03:41:23

We sure did like a lot of papa goblin. We killed over 90 percent of the hobgoblins moving counting so far, that's a a plus racing and still feel better guys. Okay, i must go. I mean, considering how goblins were looked at, at this point in the game sister i feel like even saving one of them is beyond what the ap expects us to do.

03:41:49

It really is beyond what it expects but it's adventurers. Like you who try to save things like goblins that led to goblins being unavailable ancestry and secondary. I'm just saying yeah which is why i really hate them, because they're tiny everybody to play in one e two, you just had to play them correctly.

03:42:12

Yeah. But they weren't really accepted in the one-y crowd. It's uh, it's just because they're so small. It's like i'm just a little guy. He's just a little. These are a hot goblins. They are medium size. No, i know. But like we're talking about goblins now and the original conversation.

03:42:28

It's true. He's just a little guy. Who's a good man hurt and they're like this just horrible evil things that oftentimes kill them selves off in their attempts to do things. Yeah, it's it. They're, they were like, rabbits they're, i'll never forget reading rise of the room, lords. The first several paragraphs.

03:42:50

And they're like you should describe how many of the goblins accidentally kill them themselves by falling into flaming barrels? Beautiful. Okay, i gotta go babies scrumming scrubbing, his little lungs out. Thanks guys. The baby. See you next week, bye.

03:43:27

My bean. No. Maybe.
