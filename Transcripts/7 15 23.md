27:04

Well, you guys discuss the ethics of whether or not anything we do here is actually important. I'm gonna go nap. Um, let me know if you need me for anything. No, it's just ghostin up somewhere. I'll go grab a trick. Don't we need to go get the uh that sword from the tomb thing.

27:28

Didn't we? I mean i put it in the loot list but we can certainly RP and describe it. If you guys want to, oh, she walks over here and kicks down the door, sprints down the hallway to wherever the sword is and grabs it and it brings it back.

27:48

I don't know where the vault door is. Uh actually it stands. I have a question if we're going to be on this map a lot as it's our base or whatnot, is it possible to make it so that the the lighting is like once we've explored a room? It stays visible and gray like the the fact that we're stuck because right now it's just everything is either insight or black.

28:14

Yeah, i'll do vlog exploration on on this one scene, but you guys can keep it okay because i was thinking of running around and actually exploring the place just with my token, while we're chatting and stuff that i'm like, well wait, well i'll just gonna go. Yeah, i'm still not gonna use it on other maps just because of how much server status that eats up, but we, we can do it for this.

28:36

This one that's fine.

28:43

And change.

28:51

Okay, beverage supply. All right, so the floor is more about this fortress. As we look through it, well, i can certainly go through and read the descriptions over for you again. It is an ancient fortress, the bandits clearly made additions to it. But most of the stonework, especially the hideouts that are carved into the sides of the mountain, which are almost imperceptible from the outside are excellent kill boxes.

29:26

Uh over here you have an old bath house. That looks like it used to have like a full giant sized bath in it and was modified and turned into a workshop later on There is a well in this room over here, you have plenty of fresh water. The stables are currently cold courses, i haven't put them back.

29:53

So octopus his horse in here. Over here, you have a bunch of common rooms that are full of food and tables.

30:07

Up here was the room where the barbarian leader was saying, and here is an armory, which is full of a bunch of weapons and the plus two lance. Uh, on the list. These were the cages that were filled with the slave girls.

30:29

That are now empty of the slaves.

30:35

And then before lauren shrine,

30:41

The walls of this room are covered and faded abstract decorations and riddled with cavities and cracks stone display tables stand along the north and south walls bare but for rusty metal, shards and blackened splinters of wood.

31:03

Numerous cartouches filled with inscriptions much of the symbology are carps the statue once held the two-handed sword but the stone blade has been sheared off and many of the statues features have been defaced or destroyed.

31:23

Uh, which is all immediately repaired when koya casts make whole on the statue of shizuru because that's just respectful.

31:33

A lot of them that effects and i suppose, and you're going to be the entire stone. Mason industry had a business going up. I think where is single-handedly putting several businesses out of business by virtue of existing, i don't know. Then i am a true verse and, you know, we are kind of classic.

31:59

I'm doing my people proud.

32:06

Uh the tiny inscriptions inside the cartouches on the statue are in mankind. Usually the names of samurai followed like expressions of thanks in prayers for good luck. Those of you who can read mankind.

32:23

One of the descriptions, i, as well as a single inscription with no author's name, which reads empress of heaven, touch me with your grace.

32:37

And you touched it with the seal, right? Nope. Oh, because it would make too much noise and then i got jumped. That's right. That's right. So we never did get to to do this part. I, when i may go or any one of you touches it with the emotic, seal, all of the cartouches on the statue, flash with brilliant lights, and a 10 foot deep cylindrical, pit opens in the center of the room revealing.

33:10

A repository of many weapons touching the seal to the cartouches again closes the pit and hiding the cache. Once more inside the secret cachet are several samurai weapons. Still sharp and shiny. After half a millennium the collection includes two masterwork or Yori.

33:53

In addition one of the katanas is a plus one adamantine. Katana with the tn characters for herobashi, engraved along the blade. The sort of hearabashi akakaza the ancestral weapon that hereabashiro has been searching for.

34:12

So i'm gonna go on watch seeing as we just cracked this open.

34:37

Adventurers. Are like raccoons man a little bit. Yeah, and this is a dumpster. The server is really lagging for me, so i've kind of given up exploring. Um, we broke into this place and now we're rubbing our grubby little mitts all over every inch of it. Yeah, i know you're broken because a lot of bloodshed and screaming stole, all of the gear, aligned it up, and put it into a wherever we put that stuff.

35:06

I don't know. Grayson deals with that. Uh, correct. Open this thing and simultaneously let before five how many storms exist anymore? I don't care anymore. Uh, know that we're in town. So two storms, three storms. Um, okay, so marginal, it is, it is for there are four left uh, second of all, or we sure about that.

35:37

I look to omnico. Um, do you like ask ask the storms and yeah that's what i mayco. Casts speak with stores.

35:57

No, no. We we cracked open the box to touch the seal to the the statue of shih. Tzu the box is open. Therefore we said, hey bitches. Okay, we out. It's been like a year and a half since i last heard the rules of this thing. Yeah, put me a little bit of stock here you're good.

36:16

But i thought it was only if we used it to revive someone. That's so, the box is a warding box. So, the seal, no matter what? If it's out, they be knowing where it is, because they're super powerful. The box is the thing that keeps that from happening. So anytime we open the box, they know where we are, they can know where you are.

36:38

If they look which you know, after we killed guru man they would probably know and therefore be paying attention. Okay. Oh cheat like not only did you get the name wrong but that's not even the one we killed.

37:00

Monosukairo, there we go.

37:07

Guruman knows that we killed sakura.

37:13

And a murumon. And,

37:23

Is their second floor stuff that i'm not seeing. Do i just change my elevation? All right? No. So this is not a level's map. Uh, there is second floor stuff. It's all the way over here and have fun with that. Long trip it. See it.

37:48

And as for us in the seal, uh, no, you've still got another. Oh goodness. Counts out on hands. Two and a half. Moons noise says, how old am i again do ingest but that's pretty much what you were watching.

38:16

I'm not the youngest anymore.

38:27

So, you guys have a whole day before, zero will arrive,

38:36

Electro instead of ochi over there, you sure did and i watched it happen. I was like see, there they go. Where the fucking those team. Then i'm in the ring of npc's blending in. So, um, now that that's all getting sorted out, um, what exactly are we going to do about?

39:11

Um,

39:15

And you shall go like nods over two. Um, i forget. Did we get her name via the wear tiger?

39:32

Uh, probably where did

39:43

Uh, toes cartoon.

39:57

Um,

40:01

Like what did she do after? Like the comb about it. After she's stabbed the lead guy through the chest. Probably stabbing a bunch more times. Yeah, she didn't really leave a lot of him behind. Have you ever seen how ground beef is made?

40:27

I seen ships back into what appears to be that that timid young woman after a little while, just drenched in blood.

40:43

Uh, president education, the cleaner off.

40:54

You have my things but never again, without my permission.

41:03

Oh, god, answer.

41:12

I do not know if i will ever be able to repay you for what you've done.

41:24

But if there's something within my power, i will do my best to provide it. I don't part of me really wants to just say, hey want to join our caravan. I think you have to repay us. It's what any? I think it's what i need. Decent person would have done.

41:43

Can you break me out of the second story? Yeah, exciting travels.

42:10

This one doesn't even have regular unhybrid form art. I mean she didn't even have hybrid form art. Um why this will be impossible, you didn't hire an editor again. Hmm. Oh she. Well, i don't think they expect the group to consider curing, her Stockholm syndrome. Yeah. Probably not. Uh, but this was back in the generation before paiso started wising up a little bit and they're writing techniques.

42:51

Well, if no one's gonna ask, i will, how's mankind. I've heard from that samurai i suppose but and it always this. I don't know.

43:13

More new to these parts. You see if you couldn't tell minka is dying.

43:25

The jade regions has no connections with the other countries of tiyan. And so trade has all, but stopped coming through the borders.

43:40

The other countries of gian refused to accept the jade regions as the ruler of minkai. So taxes are being raised across the country, many are losing their homes, their jobs,

43:57

Turning the battery to survive. You know, what happened to you?

44:07

The jade region decided that my village no longer needed to exist and it needed to be wiped from the annals of history. All the women were enslaved and the children and men killed.

44:29

I was the gift from the local daimo.

44:35

Am and she spits on guns. What is this thing Genghism? This would be poured gangum. Style is a thing. That's unfortunate name.

44:55

Okay.

45:02

It was 2012. I'm gonna shoot in the dark one. Do you method? Daniel wait, no 2013.

45:16

Not specifically.

45:21

I know his name is sukutsu seneca.

45:32

So i'm sorry if this is too probing a question, but um,

45:40

Did he turn you into? Well, what we saw back there or where you always like that, i thought we had learned that she was naturally born Competitively speaking. Yes, but i find it very funny for the shape-changing tune to be asking. Have you always been able to do that?

46:12

You always been able to turn into a fox.

46:18

Oh wait. Actually, you can't. I like her. Like you're, you're welcome to stay with us if you'd like, yes. Oh, jeez, good. Oh, geez. Gonna stop showco there. He's gonna grab him by his fox face. It closes his mouth, it'd be like, do you want to overthrow the government with us?

46:47

Hmm. I mean i can't speak for ochi here but uh i know he's looking for a backup character and we haven't seen this wherever fellow in a long time. Yeah, exactly right in. Yeah, i only play it's i can't believe about to say the sentence in my real life.

47:09

I only play anthropomorphic characters.

47:18

Was gonna say, tell us, you're a furry without telling us. You're very, i've never in my life. I just wanted to use this fucking double walking stick, katana. I was like tengo and now i'm an accidental furry.

47:36

Yep, accidental. That's that's what we thought it happens.

47:43

Yeah, i never thought about it this way, but the second that you said that i was like, am i? But furry, may I kill Seneca. And can we check out how evil he is? I don't, i don't personally give out license to kill. That would be up to Lydia mayco.

48:12

She looks that it may go.

48:19

I may go look the 10. No sui for a moment. Hold on. Hold on here's an easier. Question is slavery or was slavery illegal before? The jade region took over. Is it gonna be illegal afterwards? Is the far more important question here, ochia? Well, you know, if a mako wants to make slavery legal, then we can absolutely.

48:44

Oh, she draws his sword. Just can i i'm gonna roll since motive to see if i can tell that she's bluffing right now. Hold up. Um, she definitely wants the outlawed slavery. She's not bluffing. I could have sworn that. I, i could have swore that i asked. No, i asked if it was illegal before and i thought that, i thought, that the way asked is no, is a makeup.

49:16

Like, are you gonna legalize it? Yeah, so that's what i heard. No, no, he's not, i'm sorry. I miss her too. This to actual pod. This conversation. Hold on. Let's see if she she absolutely is going to legalize it yet. Oh my gosh. She just dead's pants staring at you legalized slavery.

49:47

Okay, i'm sure my goddess, Shaylynn would approve of me. Taking away the identity of other people. She continues to deadpan stare at you shoko. Play the drums. Where's my son's motive? Oh, what have you done flamingo?

50:16

Oh my god. Right. I find entertaining that choko can is amazing at lying but terrible at detecting lies and people i know fantastic uh as aren't so good for it anymore. I soco needs to add like even even giving her a minus 20 guys. Yeah. It's still hard not to believe her soco needs to have the old man end of his nose glasses on the end of his.

50:53

No. No. You still beat the DC of 12, but barely.

51:04

Thank you, Grayson. You know immediately that she's just lying to them outright she would never legalize slavery. Because the rest of you are too fucking funny. Grayson knows but then he reminds no no like Grayson knows but the then remembers that one time we lied to him about alcohol being illegal and being kind.

51:32

Yeah. No, no. It doesn't care and nobody believes her. But it's but it's like now, whatever. Kind of, but small, the lines of like, if we really getting early, what i said, like, who are you, and what have you done with a makeup?

51:57

Koi is just laying out her tarot cards harrow guards. She shakes her head? No, i'm not legalizing slavery. And according to mankind, law, since you are directly wronged by Seneca, the blow of his execution can fall to you legally, if you wish it. I thank god. Bad word up here.

52:27

I mean samurai honor is not super different from it. I guess it's less about money is uh is there any information we can get them beforehand? I mean, he's a dimeo. Probably.

52:49

To answer your question toss, coon, or were you asking uh codes. If you could talk to him first, i think maybe i'm a little confused on who it is. She's wanting asking for permission to kill. Oh, the dameo of this area? Seneca the kudzu senega. Okay. Who is the one that sold her off?

53:17

So, i think the answer is yes.

53:24

Correct me if i'm wrong then but you're implying that like your damio is not only aware of what's going on in this region but he's just kind of letting it happen to monetary game. Profiting off of it. He is a cruel and efficient and powerful, zaimeo anyone that gives voice to dissent and the provinces ruthlessly persecuted.

53:54

If not outright killed, his guards have been given orders to execute anyone for sedition against the throne. All right. Final question contingent upon whether we let you kill them or not. Is he or is he has he ever been a goblin?

54:20

For what like for the first time like her face, kind of leaves that like almost empty mask. Look like what or hop goblin.

54:33

Oh no. This.

54:38

He has. I've smelled, i smelled them when i was there. He does have hobgoblins or something like them in his service, but i don't think that's fine. We can redeem them instead of him so he can go. I'm the goblin Redeemer. That's i'm sure. We'll just put his face in both hands.

55:00

Oh my god. We're so fucking doomed. What are you talking about? So confused. Looking now, listen. We're gonna have an army of redeemed, goblin nights behind us. When we now is the show goes, okay, a macOS, can you blend me your sword for a moment? She kind of just hands you the katana cool.

55:26

And then no, i just goes up grabs, or would you buy the column is like, so what we're going to do here is that i need to be trained in inadutsu. You're gonna help me. And i'm gonna try and beat this idea out of your brain. Hold on, i have again.

55:45

So, help me fucking god.

55:54

Oh yeah, very lucky. Sheila was on the other side. I'm doing this forcially. All right, check chat. There you go.

56:05

Actually, she might not hear you.

56:27

Did someone say goblins actually just started firing and discriminately?

56:39

Oh, this is martyrs everything and range of her bow. Look i'm scared of anybody who's trained in fucking composite bongo usage at this point. Do you really want to practice swords though? Because like, we could practice, well, considering that it is apparently incredibly easy to identify what my skills are on site.

57:05

Hi. But one of those katanas myself and carry a dicho around just to make people get the wrong idea. I love living with incredibly wise, and high level ronin was able to look at you and see what you are. And now you just assume everyone can't. Yeah, you like take application is but it's like an inconvenience for the party.

57:29

That's the problem. Oh, he absolutely made it sound like that. There's no what? I've yeah, that's the problem. It's not that he did. It's that he did in his first reaction was just, oh, fuck you. She's gonna carry around a die show, but instead of drawing or whatever, she's just gonna punch people through the chest.

57:50

Pull out their hearts. Do you know why i asked superintendent say here? Because someone got the wise idea to make it a lot more manageable and all of your swords way like i don't know, half a fucking country. It has enough.

58:33

Can be fun. Oh, definitely will be

59:12

It looks gonna be a kid narrative if you want to do. Um i think um, i will turn the grace and say i think we should give the ford another one's over. See if we find anything, you know, maybe any other entrances or secrets.

01:00:27

A new activity. What happened? What the sword can support.

01:00:42

I didn't say that.

01:00:51

Cool. We'll just pod that one to my increasing psychosis and move a long, shall we?

01:00:58

So after after giving the whole ford a months over like, um, how hard does it seem that you would be from for to break in here, incredibly easy. Yeah, exactly. What if you know, how? If you know the way in how well hidden is the back actually,

01:01:27

Uh, a skilled ninja could find it if they had the time to search.

01:01:38

It's a DC. 25 perception, check to find the secret passageways and then a DC 25 disabled device to open them unless you've been turned into a ghostwarm and walk through them. We should get the back door trapped.

01:02:00

Anyone here to know how to build a trap like a really good one. I mean in some unable to do like a magical trapper medical arm or something.

01:02:23

Oh yeah. Just casually drops like a symbol of something. Uh, i don't think she has any symbol spells, actually. My whole game broth. Here we go.

01:02:47

You can see what she has prepared. I can't see. It does not being cool with any of the ones that allow for like, spontaneous shackles to be meant, but you could probably do something Tom

01:03:07

She gets refuge next level. There's just been good.

01:03:18

But,

01:03:51

Bell or the ability to be coming for able to pass through it. I mean, if it's

01:04:22

So she can do that so she can put like, a seal of sleep somewhere, a symbol of sleep. That feels dazzman. We've got 99 ninjas aren't well known for their will saves. I take that personal life. You're right. But i take that problem. She just looks at you and you fall asleep.

01:04:48

She dead pan looks into you, i could kill all the view if i wanted.

01:04:56

You know, kill the mclared OG begins, pray, google sleeps with his eyes open. So he knows. Yeah, yeah. But you're already asleep and that's in our domain koya. Koy, it looks at you. And then your eyes closed. I'm so glad to be rid of that fucking thing. I tell you.

01:05:22

But yes you can put some defenses it will take a couple of days because she has to prepare the spells to do it. That's fine. Because then we could start my uh mask of Zorro training montage. With uh, with no way with no way? Yeah. Where i some for some reason, have a whip and i just whip her.

01:05:42

Oh, she tries to stab me.

01:05:51

I have a lot of problems with this. You didn't have any problems with slavery, five minutes ago.

01:06:03

Because that wasn't real, you obnoxious fuckhead, you don't, you didn't know that. Now, if it was on the color, I hate where you're going with that, please. Stop. I'll make a blushes a little bit and says so what that could be fun. Oh geez. Thankfully the gears no, is neck.

01:06:34

Just creative. Just like it though. Oh she is. Thankfully already over here. Drawing a big circle at the ground.

01:06:45

So who is drunk again? Don't be rich at the end of this. What's next for the caravan?

01:07:02

You should start the rice runners doing probably back to varicia at some point.

01:07:16

I mean, you're in mint guy. Now, you really need the caravan. Still, i don't have anywhere to live.

01:07:27

You will always have room in my career event nochi, but you're in the middle of a fight.

01:07:39

I mean i'll just say there's nothing keeping in here you if you um if you don't want to help you just want to get on with your life like we won't ask you to fight this war with us. So when you say there's nothing keeping him here you see him kind of turn and look at i'll make a who is watching?

01:08:05

No way and he shakes his head. You don't really know me. Well, not to say that. I would not abandon her to this.

01:08:25

Show going on. Some my apologies under right.

01:08:33

I didn't have no idea. I have not no way since she loved my younger brother. Before his death, let me go. I may go again you'll get the characters right eventually eventually i don't know why this started. It's really no echo now. But feels like a simply cease. It's it's just a make-away.

01:09:03

A make-away, a make-away. I like i know it. Go take away.

01:09:12

All right. Well.

01:09:18

If everyone's on the same page stops blood and i'll just assume the teeth everyone's on that. Anyone can hop off whenever they want it. We're adorable. No return. Now, are you just like wandering around asking people if they want to jump ship?

01:09:38

I think this is the last chance to do that. I guess we go just view the little defeatest. I just want everyone to know what we're in for, we're about to basically declare war.

01:09:59

Yeah, no that's good. I understand.

01:10:07

Uh, but no i'm i am not going anywhere.

01:10:13

So in our fancy circle over here. Oh, gee is not gonna insult. No way by making her do any kind of just holding the sword or meditating or anything like that. We're getting straight down to like some basic kata. Just some stances and a couple of basic moves to what is the generating?

01:10:38

I'm sorry. I i have absolutely no idea, but i was just figuring, we were going to go drinking and i found that debuff on the list and it sounded funny. Okay. Perfect about familiar with that debuff but okay. I also have no idea what it is. You open twitter, there's degenerating and regenerating now on the buff lists.

01:11:09

I forgot that they added a bunch for anyways, but yeah. Okay. But yeah, for the most part, there's the emoji a side by side sort of deal, but where there's any incorrect like forms that she's taking, he'll just like, come over and like move her foot a little bit or like turn her shoulder, so that she's standing the right way and practice, those just to get the habits down.

01:11:40

It's been a few years and so actually, i have no doubt that you'll take to it quite naturally. It's just this. There's strong basics that need to be in place. I think that you'll be a natural.

01:12:03

Well, we'll see about that, she just kind of blinks at you a bit, i'm more concerned. What what will you do? When to make goes on the throne.

01:12:15

Like, if you ask that question, mid-squarium i just kind of freezes for a bit and i was like

01:12:24

Would you like the optimistic answer or the actual one? Just yours. I'm just curious. I want, i want to show my family. What i've done, i want to show them. Oh yeah. You are mankind, aren't you? Yeah, i'm very excited actually. I think they will be very proud of me.

01:12:48

Must be nice as, for me.

01:12:57

I'd like to stay but i have a thing i need first.

01:13:07

I don't know how long that'll take. So that is good. It's good to have goals, that's why i ask. I'm not sure i'm sure there will be some sort of place for me you know to be important and to do good works. But i don't know what will happen after.

01:13:25

Really my brother. In sukio, you have recently been given the title of the lord of house should be motel. I do, thank you. Yeah, i know you hear from the wagon and about blow cup of smoke comes from way in. I am. Oh the, i'm the son of a stable master from a fishing village.

01:13:48

I know. Not even the first thing about me, the lord of the house susukiboto. Well, you've got a bit more perspective on how she feels. So i sure do.

01:14:09

He just goes back to smoking pipe. Slide interr. Welcome. I'm glad that you're here. Sometimes i forget and then you do that and it's just great to have you.

01:14:27

Thanks. So what's up with the rabbit? I still don't understand.

01:14:35

Um, see that i thought it was you too. You two. Get that. Thought it was you too. You too.

01:14:48

Now you don't you should get a bird.

01:14:54

Uh i think contractually any birds that i always have a conversation with would probably just hate me for what you've done to birds. Okay, it's true. However, they are in good contention with sugar as i understand yes. Much respect for mr. Choco.

01:15:20

Password. But rabbits rabbit was A hand from one of your gods. I assume as we make it, particulars included in that makes sense in the world. We live in, if not to me.

01:15:44

I was circuli is one of the common. Ten gods. No, no, i get that. It's just, oh, she's just like all these these crazy servants of god's and he had to steal a bird from a bunch of vikings. Well, i think you're looking into the wrong way. Oh, that's your problem.

01:16:10

And so OT turns his head like nearly upside down and it says a little how should i look at it an entire year of a game without you describing that particular bird action and now i can't not unpicture it with that fucking conical hat. Yeah, it's beautiful, isn't it?

01:16:29

It's actually really hard with the hat on because he's he's bird. So his neck and like, do some cool stuff, but it's a pretty big hat. So he has to like really maneuver to do that. It's, it's appropriately secure. Um, but the way you should probably look at it, if i'm honest is that those of us that have had to this one, be dropped proverability in the correct direction.

01:16:59

Pops, that help that that you haven't needed. It is probably a talking to how well you've managed to stay on your path even if i do think those backs on occasion, that's true. I feel like you're telling me good job and that's how i'm choosing to take it. And thank you, good, because you should

01:17:28

Nothing. Just move your feet a little closer together. You're a little wide.

01:17:36

Hard to move. The way I won't use this.

01:17:43

New body. Who this nobody? Who this? Ah, i mean things are like, they don't give you a. The, the comedy did not give me a ready list of, by the way. Here's how we're gonna. Fuck you up fun or attacking. So adjusting has been fun. They didn't give you a manual.

01:18:12

That includes the breakdown of the chance to move body the way that you want to against zero. Oh, i'm ang things are louder stocks. Brighter on nice and colors. I then the whole existed. That's that's a fun one. Really deep. Oranges. What is their hair? Has? A beautiful blue sheen to it.

01:18:40

Yeah. What is that? What is this look like over here? What way in and you two are sitting on describe it. To me. Welcome back magnet.

01:18:57

Oh, she says dating the philosophical blue conversation again, stupidly I know it just doesn't appear naturally, you could make blue. The only thing it appears naturally in like in nature is a single butterfly that has purple is looking for the pure blue. Yeah.

01:19:29

But as for as for that and she she kind of stops and squints at it and it is probably at that point that you realize that her eyes are not the right color. Like. Well, she's trying to figure out what shade of blue that is. It's like an iris just isn't there?

01:19:59

A, i don't know. Is it somewhere between like an indigo and like a slate? I guess that's a good. That's a very app description of it actually. Yeah, that's what i would call it. Are you eyes, different?

01:20:25

They've been seeing weird label. What do you mean? I don't think they were this color before or something's different about them. I don't know because i can't remember because i'm a bad note-taker.

01:20:43

Which is not true. Oh, geez actually. Oh gee. The character is an excellent notetaker and writes in his journal all the time, just me as a person. It's not a good note-taker no no. It's the first time it was kind of come up. So, yeah. But you take notes on people's eye color, isn't it?

01:21:03

Yeah, why would you do that? So, i don't know, but i feel like a mako should have noticed you should beat her up for noticing. Oh, she noticed apparently, i should get whips and bolts so that's it. She just kind of like the house the the weirdest grand just like.

01:21:33

That is going to be an interesting conversation from later time. I may go just shrugs in the distance. I keep telling everyone, i worship Shailene.

01:21:46

I thought that was callistria who's shalin's brother. Yeah. Yeah, i don't like that connection either. I like, i like the color streamlined. Instead, can i go back to thinking about that? One, that one seemed fun. There are two sides of the boinging coin. I don't know what that means and i have literally spent entire evenings and calistrian whore houses.

01:22:19

So am i supposed to hold my like like this or like this when you take like an upward swing any? I just um, there are two different techniques. We'll start with the more basic one and he shows you what he said work on that and that'll be, they'll be it for today.

01:22:36

You want to get just a couple of these basic moves down and then we'll move on to some fancier stuff you're doing really well though. This is it's not super different from the blades you're using currently. You know, just heavier and more cumbersome. You just showing you to lose, you want to be able to take advantage of the more leverage, you get out of the longer blade.

01:23:00

And also the increased reach, there's certain things you need to be able to manipulate in order to make the most of those. Otherwise you might as well stick to the short blades. No. That wasn't from my end. That was from kelda.

01:23:39

Good work, naruto.

01:23:44

Let's say, yeah. Let's uh let's see. What koi is cooking up? It's about brunch time.

01:24:06

I bet it's the bombers food you've ever had in your life. Oh, for for real? Yeah, absolutely.

01:24:18

I've discovered water has a taste, that's the new thing, and i hate it. That interesting no coya has made shepherd's pies for everyone today. Oh fuck. Yeah, i love shepherd's pie.

01:24:40

Um, fire campfire.

01:24:46

Oh my god. It's huge. You made a pyre. Oh,

01:25:01

But yes for lunch, everyone has shepherd's pie and mead and sake. Like the barbarians actually had quite a bit of supplies here in this portraits. Uh it was pretty well stocked. They were a fairly high level barbarian group even if you did take them.

01:25:26

Of course, this is why all of the norm kings earned their throne through stealing blood. Once we go back, i might become lanorm king. We'll see how i feel. Don't forget to find a little norm for you to kill first. Sure. I love how casual issues helped. You might kill the dragonly have you made elder?

01:26:07

And that's literally how you met her in every long house. This side of all this stuff, the difference of course, but i believe her education. Actually, that might not be a bad idea. What, what if does it have to be a lanorm or could it be something like some sort of foreign imperial dragon type thing?

01:26:30

You want to go and kill the one of those forest dragons. I mean, as long as it's not one of the good ones that uh, you know, we're gonna get kind of shamed for a messing with no content. It was the forest ones, that were bad. Yeah. Ah, technically why?

01:26:52

There are the ones that they're bad. Yeah. Um, underworld dragon comes to mind. Oh, that would make a good story. I hear they have the best treasure too, so we will go and we will kill an on the world dragon and you will be my yaro. Sounds good. And this is where grace and kelda leave the group and go on some driving.

01:27:21

Hey yeah. Adventure only to be reunited with the party several years later as they arrived in their solid gold. Drip, it just be taken from a treasure vote. Great. I will have to keep this idea in mind if there's ever like a time skip in this campaign. Yeah. Soco.

01:27:41

Oh, Grayson's wearing uh, shows of goo of the the gold drip. I i i'm genuinely and i want to see that. Now it goes against every fiber of my being but i i need to see this. Can you turn gold into the flip into fabric? You can right cloth of gold.

01:28:04

Just gold thread cloth of gold. There are legends of certain say, being able to spend gold into fabric instead of getting invisibility in low light. If there's just any light he can blind everyone, it's 60 feet, just daylight. Yeah, same thing sunburst. Yeah, mechanically works out the same.

01:28:35

That's actually the best idea. Yeah, that's that he'll be that one episode of samurai jack where he fights the ninja and he like hides in the light. It's exactly like that. That's one of the best animated episodes of anything ever. It's so good.

01:28:59

So, as the day is, winding down zero and hutsui arrived with all of their rodents. Uh, apparently victorious in battle against the outriders. Where are you? Happily. You know, my games like a clap?

01:29:22

Okay, she is i see you were successful.

01:29:33

On a measure of success, i Did you manage to open the vault? We did don't be shy. Come join us by the fire. We'll tell you all about it. I'm trying to get my ass is legging.

01:29:55

We did and we got your sword. Did you the one you've been searching for? Yes.

01:30:10

And OG will pull it out of what i'm sure is the bag of holding and presented to it.

01:30:20

He kind of holds his hand out for a moments.

01:30:28

I will be honest. Well, i thought you capable of taking the fortress. I did not believe that you we're a true air of the imperial families.

01:30:46

I they remove the dike, he removes the daikyo from his back, which is and exquisite. Thank yo i it's this asymmetric minkai lung bow or daikyo is six feet long and made of laminated bamboo wood and leather with a grip crafted from the hide of an imperial dragon. The bike yield commanding presence is a plus two seeking composite lung bow that adjusts its strength rating to match the strength, bonus of its wielder.

01:31:17

Once per day, the wielder of the daiku of commanding presence can fire a single arrow into the air, which illuminates the surrounding area with the effects of daylight. For one v6 rounds all allies within the daylights felt's area of increased illumination, 120 feet, receive a plus two, morale bonus on saving throws against sphere and a plus one morale.

01:31:35

Bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge for a duration of the daylight effect. I if the wilder of the dike running presence is a cavalier or samurai, this daylight effect counts as a banner for the purpose of the character's banner ability. And the morale bonuses are treated as for a cavalier or samurai five levels higher.

01:31:54

Oh, dang. In addition, a cavalier or samurai wielding, the IQ of accounting presence can use his challenge ability against the foe within the first range increment of the bow and deals extra damage to the target of his challenge with arrows fired from the bow. Daikyo commanding presence is an ancestral weapon of the higgers, agashiyama family.

01:32:18

One of the five imperial families of minkai imbued with rail honor.

01:32:27

That's a really cool bow.

01:32:33

This belonged to an imperial family, the higashi yama family, it is only right. It returns to the imperial family. And he offers it in exchange for his family's katana uh trading it to you OG with reverence and respect. Oh, she does the same, he passes him, the sword. And he takes this really cool longbow.

01:33:05

And then runs over really fast to grace him and answered and hands integration hold up. Hold up there. Oh she uh i don't i don't know if that's for me.

01:33:21

Oh, she runs away, but i'm just kidding.

01:33:29

And and why shouldn't it be grace and son?

01:33:36

Uh, don't i don't think, uh, lady make a really would want me as part of the families. We think of you as family, i'm just a birdman and now i'm the lord of the sigimadu. I've helped us immensely on this journey and i think you deserve it just as much as anyone of us.

01:34:05

We're not asking you to rooming kai, just continue to do as you have done.

01:34:16

You could at least use it for now. It interests. You, it is a weapon and viewed with rail on our, it will hurt and a more room on

01:34:31

Uh, yeah. But that fencing description of everything that it can do seems more apt for a samurai that it does. But i lack some of the features because of my archetype that it calls for it.

01:34:51

Is your bow better? He's the wrong kind of samurai. Yeah, i'm a i'm a dancy pretty robe samurai. Not a fully armored with a banner strap to my back samurai. Uh, i mean for me the it would basically be a going from a plus one boat to a plus two bow and i'd be losing out on uh, one of the, the abilities of my current bow that soonish, i'll be able to actually, finally make use of with all those other special fancy things like the seeking and stuff like that.

01:35:27

It doesn't do any like thing for mechanically. Okay, i could hold on to it for you. You will be, uh, the hagashiyama, lord a name. And i'll just hold this bow for you. I guess. Sounds good. How about we with table this conversation? And we can come back to it later.

01:35:50

Sounds good. Are you trying to steal my man killed with, like, halfway up with her? Long sword have drawn. I've known him for approximately three days longer than you killed a watch the way you speak to me. Invest a. Yes. No. It is not a yes, but i don't know.

01:36:17

Keep keep acting up and we'll see. I will fight you. I'll fight you too and then let's go. Let's go. No, no weapons, okay? No weapons. She cracks just a quick sad question. What is skelda's strength? Sell those strength is higher than anyone else's in the party. Perfect. Especially when she rages.

01:36:51

I seem to recall that my cousin wants nearly broke my wrist in an arm wrestling contest. I, what am i the fucking are? You am i the fucking weapons? Bear for this group. What's going on here guys? So many weapons. I mean the imperial family weapons were designed to be wielded by samurides.

01:37:14

You're the only samurai everybody take a samurai dip right now. Come on, i'm not carrying it all these. I only have so much strength.

01:37:28

I'm just, i don't know. Have a tattoo laden on you to make things that reminds me actually clear. We need to talk later. A good ideas, she looked up from her cards. Okay. Winning. What do you mean terrible ruinous ideas? We're going to completely ruin my back, i decided

01:37:58

Okay. Anyways, back to our friend here who are just staring kind of llama statue group,

01:38:15

We thank you for bequeathing this to us, and we're most glad to be able to return your weapon to you. You are a most interesting group, we get that a lot and i don't know why.

01:38:33

Um, so what's next? How can we help the people before we move on?

01:38:47

My running are coming to occupy their fortress.

01:38:56

Safe and comfortable. We will begin repairing the damage. We were hoping to make it more defensible. We were we found it a little too easy to gain access. We would hate to be surprised. Maybe you have some thoughts and you can help us reinforce this place. Yes, we will do this.

01:39:23

We know the j. That region is a massing troops to defend his claim, to the jade throne, in addition.

01:39:37

The governor of kasai has been accused treason bleeding many of the other nations of gianziad to Cut off trade with us which you guys were already told was kind of happenings. So we've heard the new merchant class of minkai different from the samurai casts and the civilian cast uh is centered in our western cities of acupunto and in ganoka and suckabe to an extent with the decline in the empire.

01:40:28

They are becoming restless many Daniel or unhappy with the new surplus of taxes.

01:40:44

We jade regions, has purchased a foreign mercenary, force known as the typhoon guard.

01:41:01

With the nobility. Choco. No, let's check on the typhoon card. I'm sorry. I was muted. Can i get an olive check on the typing? God, uh, let me look them up because they say of unknown origin.

01:41:57

There's no information on them in this book.

01:42:06

Give me a hard knowledge locals since they don't know what's country of origin. They're from.

01:42:43

It's too generic and name. I mean,

01:42:56

I was at this fan that carry his name, you would have to see specific sigils or something to get a better idea.

01:43:15

But they are expensive and the jade regions pays them.

01:43:28

Your subjects.

01:43:35

I think stirring a rebellion here in the provinces of anganoka and sakabe is more likely than anywhere else, but it will be, we will need more than my ragtag band of peasants and roses.

01:43:59

Thrown in. What about the contacts? What about three cats? One rabbit. A monkey. A bird 12. Piglets five vikings? Oh, gee! Shut up. Okay.

01:44:33

Apologies. I'm still processing the 12. Piglets. Why do you have so many pigs? They needed. It was a very long story, but i am not interested in repairing today, while you're trying to give us a breakdown of how exactly you want us to take over. Hi, very well. First this freeing up the military from the dimeels control.

01:45:01

Well, maybe not first. Then we have to get the merchants on board and the underground. I think we should slip this up into three missions. I would contact first the ninja clans.

01:45:25

While their age, may be distasteful to many imperial samurai. They will be useful to us if nothing else getting them to remain neutral in the rebellion, would prevent them from being enemies. Once we tried to take Kasai,

01:45:50

How have the shinobi clan? Some mankai generally responded to the reason school. They generally followed him more somewhat remained distance from not from.

01:48:36

You guys talking, i can't hear you.

01:49:14

Okay, i got sound back. I don't know what the fuck out. Okay. What was the last thing you heard? Oh god. You the have the ninja remain neutral. Have they have they reacted to the gene region. That's where i left off.

01:49:34

Oh i so he said that he is not familiar with the ins and ounce of the shinobi politics, but that all three of the monkeys could be met upon the new moon. She'll go after when the new moon was and everyone was like yesterday. Uh, so you have a full month of time before the ninja can be gathered or you can go and see, whichever one of the representatives is their currently instead of seeing all three that is up to you.

01:50:06

Uh, the other people that we would need to speak with. Uh, so that's an ingadoga, which is 500 miles away. So at a 32 miles a day, i don't want to math in my hand. Where's my calculator?

01:50:37

Yes. So by the time you get there you'll have like another 13 days till the new moon. So you could spend a couple of weeks in a big city if you wanted to where you could sell things.

01:50:55

After this, you will need to speak with the geisha.

01:51:07

You're gonna have to explain that one to me, the best way to get the support of the merchant is through the geisha of minkai. They know many secrets that can be used to manipulate the empire's, merchants and nobility. I would recommend the kinaro. Yo, my a tea house in sacabai.

01:51:31

It's like a bait, their entertainment district is second only to that of cosite. The owner of kiniro, the skill them respected, geisha named Okohaku and needs of the late governor of cosite and likely hates the jade region for killing her uncles.

01:51:58

That one should be an easy victory to bring to our side. Can we, can we have a map screen? I don't, i don't have a map currently in of the full thing. Hi, as i mentioned earlier, i did not get to do a lot of preparation for game because i could not look at a screen all week.

01:52:20

That's fair. But i can get a map of ring guide to put in discord and then you can just tell us like east west generally Ah, perfect. This one has everything on it. So, we need actually,

01:52:51

Boom. No, not in alphia, put it in jig region.

01:53:07

Moving.

01:53:21

Load, please.

01:53:40

Thank you. There we go.

01:53:52

So just so i can recap because i am trying to take some notes here, instead of go through my audio, it's 500 miles away is where we would talk to the ninja clans and it's in a month when they gather again because we just had the new moon. Yeah, so you are here right now.

01:54:14

Anganoka for the ninja claims are is here. The geisha are here. That's the best way to approach the geisha. As always is to letter them. I personally delivering an expensive gift to the tea house. Choko, you're up.

01:54:47

Zero. Kind of looks at you show, goes a ladies, fox, you know, he got that dog in him. I mean,

01:55:15

I'll do my best to make sense.

01:55:24

Also in

01:55:30

Okay.

01:55:49

Words for almost his. I don't need anything of the source you simply suggested, but if he's such a bother mentai would better bottom.

01:57:20

Pretty bad. Yeah. No, he absolutely wanted to know where you stood with that. All right. I got to go pee, enjoy break.

01:57:52

Just real quick. Can you guys hear me?

01:57:57

Uh, you're super quiet. Yeah, you're very quiet. That's okay. That's fixable.

01:58:05

Check check. Hello. Now. No, too loud. No, you're good. Fine. All right cool. Thank you guys.

01:58:22

That should work better. I'll be back. Have a fun break.

01:58:45

What are you wearing?

01:59:42

Your mom gave.

02:00:05

A sweet bean.

02:00:58

What do you think that?

02:01:07

The last quartzilla.

02:09:09

In my man. Thank you to my man. Thank you, honey. And my man. Thank you to my man.

02:09:24

Mommy. Hi, it's ginger friendly neighborhood neighborhood labor and delivering nurse and i'm always happy to debunk things on the internet by labor delivery that aren't true. But this is true as if men weren't already cause enough for our everyday struggles in life. They also are partly responsible for pre-eclampsia.

02:09:48

I first learned this from my OB doctor dr. Tayvon. When my face look like this, my feet look like this and i checked my blood pressure and my blood pressure was 180 over 110. He said that, although we don't know the exact cause of preeclampsia, we do know that there is a strong link to the baby day.

02:10:09

So already blame every life inconvenience on him anyway so it works out well but you know, i love evidence. So let's get into why, or at least theories on why they think the baby daddy is partially responsible. This is an article from 2019. Where is 2019 called the turtles determinants in preeclampsia different lines of evidence have demonstrated the role of the father in the onset of preeclampsia.

02:10:39

Here's what you need to know, the placenta is what we believe is the true cause of the preeclampsia. But what goes into that, you see the placenta is one of the only things besides the baby that has buy parental factors. Meaning both parents genetic situation comes into the creation of it.

02:11:01

The existence of a

02:12:42

Lehrar.

02:12:48

Way, i'm sorry, roar xd. Right. D walls, around them next day.

02:13:06

I just want you to know, i actually cringed saying that.

02:13:12

And made you guys a cookie, but i'm eating cookies. But i eated it. I ate poptarts. I wish i had popped out right now. I have nothing in my house. I've got to go grocery shopping today. I made carnitas again and i'm eating a carnitas burrito. Okay, share with the flash.

02:13:36

It's it's a fucking lot. You got to go to the Mexican market and buy water. And you got to like fry, the pork really hot for like four minutes aside on like, all the individual pieces, and then you got to put it all back in after and then cook it for like two more hours.

02:13:55

But staying up to one in the morning. Two nights ago is worth it. You just have like unlimited carnitas burritos on top.

02:14:09

All right, i think then everyone except the max is maximum pack.

02:14:22

Taking that as a milk, it feels like a no.

02:14:33

B, b, and bb mama are watching the new guardians of the galaxy on the living room right now. Oh yeah. Anybody see it? Uh, i have seen an idea, it was good.

02:14:58

Again.

02:15:07

Did you say? I guess that's fine. Yeah, it wasn't overthrilled with it. I didn't hate it. Either not hurting. It is the new button mark for marvel movers. That's fair. Like if you can get over that hurdle, it's a good marble movie at this point. All fair points.

02:15:38

Seriously, nothing for this, okay. Oh, our mission triple choose to acceptance. Sorry, and go. Um, seven aches. Um, or bring them as suitably expensive gift. It sounds like a bunny problem.

02:16:05

I don't do that.

02:16:13

Ambiguously. Do something about the dining room for anybody wondering. Oh, g comes from over here.

02:16:24

The eastern coast of minkai. Oh, it's a place that will probably run to We shouldn't be going there at all here, because besides here, unless there's something going on. And in the one shoe version. Nope. I carefully looked at this map when deciding my player backstory and chose the opposite coast.

02:16:54

So i didn't have to come up with a bunch of stuff on the spot. Where fletching out? Super hard sounds like we're gonna go over there now. This sound like an excuse to pass by your family place. Nope, does, doesn't it? Nope. My brother's in kasai. If we're doing that i'll i'll divert us right back to the capital.

02:17:22

So i was looking at the some stuff with that, bow versus what i have already. And there it, the seeking does do something that my improve precise shot doesn't do. So it is technically an upgrade into those but can't you just keep going to get up. Yeah. Where i could use those key points to do extra attacks.

02:17:50

I'm not good enough and what you're using at the bumps, plus one, a plus, one key intensifying adaptive composite number. He focusing key intensifying. Um, we're it is with with sans, put on the boat that we got out of the that one, uh, chance where we found the seal, and i made an exception, because they were very few.

02:18:20

Monk enhancements for range weapons. Unfortunately, i won't get any use out of that special ability to level 15. I know he's had it since grind wall for all purposes. It has been a plus one. Uh longbow. Exactly. I haven't paid to upgrade it because it's technically a plus three bow right now and that's expensive.

02:18:41

So yeah, if you take the daiku it will you'll be like a shark a bow shark because it's like six feet tall and you're like for something. So just around it's just gonna be this giant. Bowfin, that's what i was thinking about with ochi's. Like not even five feet tall.

02:19:05

I'm like this will look funny as hell. I mean you could always just give it to show lately. Is nearly seven foot tall. I'm not. I wouldn't look as fun now. Yeah. Just look like a regular bow basically. Yeah. What were the other the one of them was a banner thing and one of them was like range challenge and you could use challenge on range attacks instead of melee, which i think it's normally just meal, right?

02:19:30

Yeah. Like i get well some some archetypes and all those have lowering challenge. Um, but like it's so good. The bow, lets you challenge anyone within the bow's first range increment though? Yeah, but i guess it was pretty good thing has more than 100 feet like between the only problem is normally that would be great if you like wanted a challenge them and then have another swift action that you do after you close, but i'm uchi.

02:20:10

So i could just challenge them and then be at them within 100 feet if that's what i have to do. It's true because you run faster than most horses. Do. That is true? Yeah, the thing that gets me, the most about that is like, i know that we have, like, katanos unlock those.

02:20:30

I'm so sorry. If that is the most religiously class specific thing in a game starts and bruisia. Yeah, for real. I'm pretty meme about that one person. That's, that's pretty funny. I mean, to be fair, like all of the royal weapons are kind of designed for samurai in mind.

02:20:59

Yeah it's it doesn't make any noise. Fine. So we should have done it all work on a cavalier is the important thing to note. Oh, which is why i believe cavalier was one of the recommended classes. That would be a fun progression to play a cavalier through this. AP though it goes into the samurai, that'd be really good.

02:21:23

Yeah, because i guess you get the free pass, you know what i mean? This, you get the the taking your large amount anywhere pass because everywhere that we're going to fucking care has been large. Yeah you know emotionally true but i'm going to just go ahead and point out the pagoda.

02:21:39

I'm go that bowl. That's true. Boy, keep firework cavalier, who specialized and mounted stuff.

02:21:53

I i may have turned into a salt mountain in pagoda, i'm just being like fascinating, mmm, great and all those fucking shadow teleporters, too. Thought of it. Oh, maybe you're eating because aside from the upper part of the footagoda. The bottom part was quite a large creature friendly except for getting it down, the hundred foot drop.

02:22:14

Yeah, yeah. It's the logistics of it more than anything else, which isn't really too much of a problem if you work around it. But like for a standard party kind of set up, you know what i mean? Just a music. Oh, absolutely. It would be funny if you started as a cable either, um, because you'd probably at some point be begging you again.

02:22:38

Like, can i just can you consider be having a same right? Yeah, no. Can i just be a samurai because i can't take both classes.

02:22:49

I mean, i would do this the training montage thing. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Of course. All right, i'm returning. Welcome back. Yeah, absolutely. I love a training montage. We love a good training my time. You you have? Yeah. Yeah, doesn't. Oh, she has combat reflexes. Right? I do. I think pretty sure cool.

02:23:15

So i can justify this.

02:23:21

Oh, we're doing retraining. Where's the create weapon attack button again? Are you on the inventory tab? I sure am. If you click edit item and gun into the item. See, have you now gone yet to the detailed tab. Is that where it is?

02:23:45

There it is. Do i count as a master knowing a beat? If i already know the heat and i wish to train and take, you think a second

02:24:01

Foundry. Did not like me hitting that creative time button. You are coming through. I just self-training. Never works. Like that self-training, it's harder by definition. What do you you want me to take magical tale? So i can train you in more magical tales and then that would be great.

02:24:27

Careful. I got you. I'm retrieved as my heart and hot, but she doesn't seem, so she is two tails.

02:24:40

So i could spend this month training her, if you rule that, like, i can do that for her because i had more tails, you know.

02:24:58

By manchoka really trying to get those extra kids. Why do i need more tails? Oh no. No, i didn't. I didn't okay into our community. Everything about me. Arrow is designed to make shoko uncomfortable. It's so good. I've been in. Love it so much.

02:25:27

Um, well you don't need them, it's just that they could be helpful sometimes. And you know, i thought since we're going out much to do otherwise, like to just

02:25:41

Well, it's sort of like a like a spiritual journey. You have to go on with within your own like tail. He wants to internal searching. Uh i just don't think it's good of me. Stay calm. What i think of.

02:26:06

The revelations actually.

02:26:18

And have spent my whole life with the kami.

02:26:27

I could learn more tales.

02:26:40

I will learn one more. It has been years.

02:26:49

So everything that's okay. Am i allowed in this service for free? Or i i, oh, yeah. I'm just imagining this conversation and no way walking past with like a cup of coffee or something and then just goes over to make it like i may go there they're talking about teaching each other tales.

02:27:14

What the fuck is going on?

02:27:25

I don't know. Kids today magic stuff. No, and it's weirding me out by their phrasing.

02:27:37

It does meditating do that to you.

02:27:43

Those the bunny been lying to me. Well i don't really know what, all the bunnies been saying to you so i can't really answer that.

02:27:58

I so yes, matar, uh, Yarrow miaro, uh, enthusiastically takes to her training but she seems far more interested and playfully flicking you with her tails than actual study. I but will eventually grow a third tail under your tutelage? Uh, which just grows her ability to play pranks that much further.

02:28:38

Let us see what things. She can inflict now tail. Three i believe is mitz direction. Yeah.

02:28:52

Something i've been looking for an excuse to use but have yet to find it. Good one. Misdirection. Yeah, yeah. Seems pretty useful. It's a pretty solid one. If you are trying to avoid detection,

02:29:18

Uh, sorry to funny. How many days exactly? Is it trip? Fantastic for crafting purposes uh crap i had the calculator open and i forgot to check 500 divided by 3 2, 15.6 days. Okay.

02:29:44

Teen and a half days. Great.

02:29:52

So anyone want to tell me what soccer cover is that what we're going? So the place, what's it like?

02:30:07

Oh, have we started traveling. I have been three. If we're gonna start traveling it was a generic question. Any of the guests to asked before we go or during one of the two make your choice. Also just an outside. I think, i think the arrow has was the fourth tail that you see ability, right?

02:30:36

Just i'm going to start with one pill and then, two, tails get you. This guy so retailers are in person. Oh then she gets charm person.

02:31:04

Let me pop open these skitties.

02:31:17

Oh, there was also one other question. I don't know it. I don't know how no, i would ask this without kind of firing herself in the face. Uh you said the, those three clans that are being represented which ones? I he pauses for a moment, the black bluetooth, the dragon shadow, and the emerald bow.

02:31:59

The green bun. Do you want to check for those? Uh, no. You made your checks about the the ninja clans way. Back in. Echin high where you met? One of the dragon shadows. Wow. That was like, what's the dragon kind of? Yeah. Okay. Uh, and the emerald bowser generally known as the only one of the ninja clans.

02:32:27

That is good. Aligned the others are the the black lotus and the dragon shadows. Specifically are neutrally aligned but will take the darker jobs as it were. Yeah. Plasticated on them. And i know what each of their mouth is then yeah, no. I just like gives a very deep frown was like that is a combination i suppose.

02:32:57

They are the most powerful of the cleanse.

02:33:04

I'm not distributing that i'm disputing why they're working together for a single representative station. What do you mean?

02:33:18

Well. Maybe it's just the way i'm looking at it. The dragon shadow answer to whatever their thing is sure. And we'll work jobs for this. And that black load us is the contractually bounds like it's alexy and horse. So, they'll do anything to the letter. Emerald sir. I thought they were kind of, uh,

02:33:58

Less maliciously, inclined.

02:34:07

I want to be clear. Now, he's saying this is someone that doesn't really have first time experience with anything only the sort of hearsay.

02:34:27

I guess do not understand what you mean with your question. Then do the cleanse. Not have leadership among them. I assumed. They did like the samurai. Maybe they do here. Cleanser in my experience. Usually self-interested the coordinate with others is not necessarily a good thing, at least not. Honestly remember Estefan here, maybe, they also play in games with politics, with one another

02:35:25

It should be a good sign. It could mean that they see fit too and together. Times, maybe they're not, maybe business isn't looking so good with the region in charge. Well, the region is taking ninja and using them at some capacity. We know that, well, maybe not the region.

02:35:56

Of this. I do not know. No, no, i wouldn't. I wouldn't expect either don't do hard about it.

02:36:11

I'm not going to.

02:36:20

You have a strange way of speaking.

02:36:31

Cooked brow. And how would you prefer that i speak? What i prefer on how you speak matters. Not, i am not the one that speaks for you.

02:36:50

I'm just commenting that it is strange. The way you speak.

02:37:02

If you said so, does your group have any more questions?

02:37:19

Then if you will, excuse me. Me and my men will get started on repairs and fortifications. By the time you get back much should be done.

02:37:33

I actually i'm a quick question for you. Uh but with these um did any of this armor be of use to you? It pulls out one of the hobgoblin uh, armor that we have like 50 of

02:37:53

Yes, if we are going to outfit an army, it needs to be cleaned but it's still masterwork armor.

02:38:06

All right, i like i've got a bunch of gear i could leave here with you.

02:38:13

Uh, good basically just say yes to to, which of these would be useful uh masterwork heavy wooden shields.

02:38:25

No, masterwork composite longbow. Yes. Masterwork morning star. Well, thanks strange weapon. No. And then the masterwork dome motor armor. Yes, very much. Yes. All right. I will leave the the bows in the armor with you mentally which i have of these two brick wall characters.

02:39:01

Just like if it's like watching two statues, he's just standing there. Arms crossed as grace and like puts one item out. Yes. No. Eyebrows going higher into it with every giant item. What hairline is out of this Mary Poppins bag. Yeah. It just goes farther up his bald head.

02:39:30

That's yeah. Uh, yeah. So i head over 49 of each of those of the jesus christ. How about how about some daggers? Knives are always good to have on you, all right and he starts pulling out 40 of them but like maybe halfway through he's like, oh gosh, i think there's more in here.

02:39:54

Uh, he starts pulling out just like stacks and stacks of bags of opium.

02:40:01

It pulls out. So 40 daggers but he puts the opium back in the bag. Like both his eyebrows are up now, not just one.

02:40:19

I will not add. Um, this is a question to the group. Do we want to give them a bunch of those potions of cure serious wounds or, or keep a bunch or which way?

02:40:36

Always be amount that we have. I don't see why that's a plus couldn't just be captain reserve at the place at this point. Yeah. Cut off, cut off half of those cure serious and let them chuck chuck them when they need them. We have put down a crate of me like look.

02:40:56

All right. I'll take out 30 of them and hand them over. Yeah, sounds great. So he at this point like he actually looked has a look of disbelief on his face.

02:41:14

I see you had much more to bargain with then i could have imagined really, there's no fucking wiki page for these two cities. You're supposed to visit on the website path on your wiki. Okay, wiki editors seem allergic to adding anything that was put in like an apa area.

02:41:42

But the problem is the book doesn't give me anything either. I was about to say when it comes to to mankai that's not the problem. The problem is just they didn't they didn't write it. Okay, no it's fine. I know what is supposed to. Oh here we go. I found a paragraph of information, as if i said, dragon the dragon gets here those sis and stuff.

02:42:04

So, and ganoka is a younger city than suck hacabe. But similarly built in a favorable landing spot on the west coast of minkai and go noke is an important commercial port. The trading activities concentrate in the open market located behind the port with rares ranging from ordinary serials and fish luxury goods are available at the corroy yang market.

02:42:28

One of minka's, most famous and luxurious commercial venues, the Anganoka are silk coming from the mulberry, orchards of the nearby hills and rock alum, widely used to dive fabric, am almost exclusively extracted in the domain of the governing to get through family, approximation and ganoka has a reputation for catering to decadent tastes legal and illegal.

02:42:53

That only the wealthiest can afford giving rise to an oct, unmerited condition, among both city dwellers and nearby villagers known as engonoka arrogance. That's not really much of a problem. I know. It's like a watered down. Magnemore. I think they'll be fine. There's no random trolls like throwing their intestines out in front of you to tell your fortune.

02:43:25

Come again, this is not. But sakakabe built on a favorable landing on an otherwise treacherous coasts. The concentric, terraces of sacagawei, climb the hills that overlook the narrow shoreline. Oh, it sounds beautiful. The lowest terraces lean on the ruins of a stone fortress. Built millennia ago was ancient stone walls, adorned with reliefs of ancient warriors are almost completely hidden by modern structures pearls.

02:43:56

Silver is extracted in the nearby sank yoda mountains, where several fortresses protect the mines from abandons and evil humanoids pearls are fished along the entire northwestern coast where an abundance of coral, reefs and natural lagoons favor. The growth of oysters and conscious the prosperity. It's like a cabe is mirrored by its culture besides rich shines and temples the town boasts refine entertainment district.

02:44:21

That is famous for voltage, tea houses, and theaters. Your second only to those in kasai the high standard of living of the town's middle class, coupled with the somewhat lean, attitude of governor has allowed the yakudza thrive in most of the traditional activities, especially gambling business and appeal of these games have become something of an attraction for visitors lending.

02:44:44

The city's single yacht is a group a measure of legitimacy, not found the elsewhere in the country, so it's the Las Vegas of minkai. I was about, i was about to say it's somewhere between Kyoto in Las Vegas. All right. I think i found my new favorite place. So no i'll definitely be able to get you great noodles there.

02:45:05

Oh, at both of them, if i'm being honest. Honestly, i just like to take, like, two days off and, you know, prowl city pretend that i'm not currently. Well, we do need to do some selling and shopping. It's been a minute. Speaking of i forgot to do this earlier but showco was talking about doing his retraining, is it?

02:45:35

Okay, if during this travel time, i swap a feet. Also uh yeah. Absolutely. So what that's in 15 days i am. Now remembering does anybody have critical focus? No, anybody in the caravan is it possible for me to get it? Or is it take longer? I believe the time doubles, if you don't have a teacher

02:46:06

And retraining a feat is a week so it would be 14 days. It's all you would be able to do for the the intact. That's all i want to do. I was trying to pull it remembering the system, right? Yeah. I'll double check. I'll double check. Please. Continue with what?

02:46:19

Verbally, almost stop the top of my head. I don't think you can. If you don't have enough,

02:46:26

Which i think is a bit sketch but i thought it just doubled the time. Yeah, you might have to check that. I don't actually know the reason. Okay, i got. Here we go. And i was 50 gold times. Um, your level uh, retraining is 10 times three level times the number of days required to retrain.

02:46:50

Okay, yeah, if no suitable trainer is available, the gm. May how you turn yourself by spending twice the normal time? Even if you're returning yourself, you still have to pay the full cost. Okay? So we're doing a feet. Yeah, uh, which takes five days. So it would take 10 days, not a full week, so 10 times two level times 10 or 12.

02:47:23

Yes, 12. I have that wear level 12 here. Am i wrong? You should be able to program. So that's 120. Gold times 10. So 1,200 wait times 10, i'm pretty sure. What was the formula? You just said it but i lost it 10 times. Your level 10 magical. I was right.

02:47:51

Okay. It was like, did i just do maritime in my head? Does anybody have 1200 gold? I can borrow until we get somewhere where we can sell shit. I just looked i have 20 gold. I've got 500 that can it can wait, it can. Wait, i was just trying to squeeze it.

02:48:17

I'll give it back shoko. Thank you. Show. Go. Okay. I can, you can just give you gold straight out of the bag of holding group loop. Oh, there's gold in that right first so much gold in there. Okay. Yeah, give show go his money back. Give me that and then just, we'll take it off of what?

02:48:36

I what i get. All right, it was how much 1200? Let's see.

02:48:50

All right, so okay to spends the whole time crafting. Um, and when we get uh, when we get a couple days out from the city, Grayson will come up to ochi who's probably close to finishing his training and we'll drop a pair of unusual looking boots on like on his lap.

02:49:16

Um, and they, they clearly have been custom-made for bird ankles for him for his for his race. And instead of just like boots for like a person, they instead almost look like, uh, like a dragon's feet. You know, the the three prong kind of like uh you're you know, bird feet.

02:49:40

Except these are clearly from a dragon and on your closer inspection. It looks like the leather from it has been made from the leather from the white dragon that we killed uh up in the north. But there's no feathers uh on the the boots at all. No feathers. Oh, you gotta you're gonna problem with no feathers?

02:50:08

No, it's beautiful. I was just repeating what you said, because i realized i have critical focus already.

02:50:20

Oh, i don't know what you mean by that. There's a big thing. I'm sorry if you put those on and you you actually like concentrate on them and such and you act to um, the inacts, their abilities, that's when the the feathers will appear. Ah, how how creative these are really interesting?

02:50:40

I've never it's going to be so comfortable to have my feet. Displayed the way they normally would be stuffing them into boots. Is, it's really such a hassle. You it's the be tough to understand unless you're a tank group, but i really appreciate the extra effort. Thank you, thank you.

02:50:55

Grayson person. It also has some extra protection against, you know, little um insects or things you might step up because there's the, you know, dragon scales on it and everything. Yeah, i can definitely stomp on um bugs or something. Super cool. Uh, so yes, i have finally finished your winged boots and whenever it is you maybe you try them out that day or something like that.

02:51:22

You find that the the feathers that come out, the little wings are made entirely out of raven feathers. It just doesn't, they are blood red in color. Yeah, they are. Ah, that's so sick. Thank you.

02:51:39

It's such a callback. It was really good, i'm definitely impressed. But really good, when i picked, when i took those, i had no idea what i was gonna use them for. I was just thinking hey, those sounds unique, you know, the specifically being called out of these, like unusual color.

02:51:56

So sure. We've got it. Got it worked out and they get

02:52:07

It's just um, uh, improved critical that you were looking for uh i could actually do that, too, but i was looking at flickering step. Now wondering if i have the ranks to take it, if you ever want to do improve critical, i have that, but i didn't spend the entire time crafting.

02:52:24

I do not have the ranks so it can't be this flickering step.

02:52:34

Damn, have you look forward to a montage with me? Teaching you how to yes, improve your criticalness with your, uh, your melee weapons as my knowledge of doing that with a bow. Yeah, it'll be something.

02:52:54

I like to think that it's actually just an anatomy class. Look coaching just hit harder, that's all you're gonna do. Yes, seriously. Murder. Have you tried hitting them really hard like, you know, aim for their neck or their heart or something. You know, that's the good chance to get a critical over there man.

02:53:20

Calls postcard was in october a while ago.

02:53:35

This game has come quite far. It's been, it's been a ride.

02:53:43

Yep, you're actually my first group in the book five. Yeah, i think i'll just spend the money since you've been spending your time crafting and taking proof critical anyways.

02:54:02

Get there and we just blank it. Sell everything. Remember to see if they want to like scroll through the list and take anything. There is a ring of protection plus two. If anybody wants to upgrade their plus one, uh i'll take a random protection plus two. Do you have a plus one?

02:54:21

You're putting back in the back. Yeah, okay. All crease that and then take that over there.

02:54:34

Oh, uh, we got a wand of care moderate wounds with 39 charges just from that. The the place we were just at i would imagine coyote would take that. Uh, she recently exhausted her wand of cure mother wounds so fat fantastic. How many charges? Uh, 39 39 i'm calling it now doesn't fucking walk.

02:54:58

Um, i'm

02:55:04

As saying, shook us, kind of blessings every day that you guys seem to have forgotten the whole. Uh, wait. Show go. You could cast your spells now. Oh no. We haven't forgotten. We've just putting that information into a back pocket for later candia. Yeah, banging on your bongos to cast healing spells.

02:55:28

That's true. You know, giving people hard palpitations and making this feel like we've had to rushes of adrenaline. Yeah, that thing fucking weird.

02:55:43

I do not much. So just so you're aware the travel over the northern parts of minkai are almost idealic. In the beautiful rolling, green steps, uh, leading off to the various mountains that stretch through the middle of minkai and around the coast. Uh,

02:56:10

I you don't really know how to put the true beauty of the of minkai into words. It is burdens and plentiful, but there does seem to be a shadow over the people that travelers you see on the roads with their wagons and cards look dirtier and thinner uh just in general.

02:56:34

As as though, the people were starving though, nature continues to thrive. There's an awful, almost juxtaposition between how healthy the land is compared to her people as though. They are disconnected from one another.

02:56:57

When you arrive at the coastal city of engonoka or which one we were going to, they're about the same distance from you. Um, which one was the ninjas? I think we should do that first and ganoka and then soccer comedy. Is naturally. Yeah. Correct. The ninjas are the one that had the like there was kind of a time frame on.

02:57:27

Right. Yeah. If you wanted to speak with all three of them and make deals, you'll have to wait till the new moon, but you can always go and speak to them one at a time. Uh, it depends, they have a rotation according to zero on which client has a representative of the restaurant at any given time, but all three of them are there to discuss business matters on the new moon between the three plans.

02:57:54

Well my my suggestion is we get there and we make contact with whoever the representatives at the time and set up a meeting and events with all three of them on the night.

02:58:16

That's what our lord shall call wants to do then. That's what we'll do. I mean really? I should just name him as an imperial air now. I mean, i can shut up forever if you guys want me to, oh, i wasn't being sarcastic. Like literally, i don't think any of us have a better idea smiling.

02:58:38

She was teasing you. I don't know why but i thought we would stop at this onsen here. Oh yeah. Uh you know we could stop there on our way back from soccer as a reward for a job. Well done. All right. Swimsuit episode. I this was discussed and promised this was promised, i wanted two things.

02:59:07

When i came back to the realm of the living, one of them was a bowl of noodles and the other was to take a decent bath. And since i haven't been allowed to do the last one because we've been on them since the sports, the fucking spirit. Well, arriving in and gadoka, you are welcome both by the smells of cooking food.

02:59:28

That drifting up from the marketplace. Uh, at the yarrow croy yayen, the market, which is a true story's home building with a black roof, surrounded by a maze of outdoor huts tents and market stalls, wealthier merchants, namely, those who deal in silk and gemstones conduct business in the hall itself.

02:59:48

One of the main attractions of the hall is a restaurant that serves quality foods to wealthy visitors. And the restaurant also happens to be where you are meant to meet one. Of the three monkeys. Fascinating. Don't care. The entrance of the cora. Yang market is guarded by a group of police, officers armed with jutee.

03:00:19

So i don't think them was like the idea of the VLR. The imperial layers returned to clean the guy, like, we are probably keep better. Secret. Absolutely, i i completely agree with this and i'm sorry, i'm sure this is going to be a fascinating conversation, but i'm really not interested.

03:00:44

Uh, i am going that way. Who wants? What i may go snaps her fingers and turns invisible. Now, let's just go fish. If i mentioned, i love you. Just any anytime. Just just, as i mentioned that yet, i'll be right back. Uh, so for those of you who cannot turn invisible, there is a free silver piece.

03:01:09

Skin treat me into the market, okay? Okay, no, they have zero questions. Except for three silver pieces. Unless you give them a hassle about paying that is i don't know. I will pay them. I will pay.

03:01:43

They, they can make change for you. Okay, that's fine. They seem absolutely delighted by the fact that you have gold, though.

03:01:55

You will surely bring much prosperity to the market come in. Well, we're sure they're gonna clean it up.

03:02:10

Uh, so in spite of the trade crisis in minkai, the kuroi market, the core iyain market, apparently still offers almost everything that is available in minkai, the market also provides. You a starch view of a culture, very different from that of standpoint and barizia mint time. Merchants seemed very honest but still seem to want to charge you higher prices, simply based off the fact that you're exotic looking some of you.

03:02:40

Anyways, uh, and the bolt of noodles, caught eight, silver pieces, per person, unless you swipe a bowl. I'm not going to steal a bowl. That seems like the least.

03:03:00

And besides i can't tell them to add extra chilies. I want extra chicken and the oiled egg.

03:03:14

I'm like, basically just starts going around the different thing it gets vegetable inside dishes. Just just as like, i have been wanting this since we left all the slime you guys get inside. You see, no way and i'mma go with the big ass bowls of food and the table claim for you guys.

03:03:34

Perfect. Sorry. I am back. I heard the baby take a spill is a good vlog. Oh, that's important for character growth. He's getting very, very character ground. It's to be a very large character. Let me tell you does your baby doing the thing worth one, she falls on her head.

03:03:55

She like doesn't like. I actually i don't know if you have a song it's it's a boy for now. He hasn't told me otherwise. Okay. Oh does he do the thing? Where he falls and then is quiet until they looks up and see? The people are watching him and he starts crying um, children that eventually for little ones.

03:04:16

Yeah. But he's very adventurous, we have his uh we said the extra bed off of the bed frame. So his room has like a bed on the floor and he just keeps trying to like jump off of it, for whatever reason. I don't, it's very alarming. All righty. So, i am going to post this.

03:04:38

I so this place has this amazing restaurant. The food is to die. For it is. The chilies are well diced. The noodles are well sauteed perfect amount of like ancient sauce, like 10 year old aged ancient barbecue sauce in the noodles. Uh, you have never seen. No way, this happened.

03:05:05

There is plenty of you have convert show, go and silent. Tears are stupid. It's so good. There is bowel wood. Coconut custard in filling. There's also standard childhood bowel. Uh, what you're just regular pork. Hear me uh, all sorts of delicious dumplings made with carrots and beets. And shrimp.

03:05:40

There's all sorts of seafood. Dishes here. Also sushi.

03:05:49

You know, before the whole that part like fruit, tasted good. But not not like good, you know, i mean you've got brand new taste buds now and fruit is full of sugar.

03:06:11

Oh, jeez. Shoving. Sushi into his face. You're, you're all just having bad like shonen anime scene, just shoveling all just taking food, a little plates and tipping them up directly into his peak and they slide off one by one starts. Looking nervous as she started a tab. I no i don't know if this is rude to acid.

03:06:39

Didn't what is all this crap? Do they just have any like meat or something? Oh g pulls. Some of the fish off of the sushi and hands in some of the fish. Oh, no, it's good. I think you're just committed a war crime. Um, really good. Do that every day.

03:06:56

But whatever i ordered a roasted chicken and the roasted board as well grease. And they should be here anytime. Oh excellent.

03:07:08

We didn't leave you out. You know, i've never actually thought about this. But how many of my techniques do we think are going to be impeded by the fact that i'm going to be so fat after today?

03:07:25

Thank you very seriously and in in like the light of the marker because again, the happiest issues ever being like horizon, just kind of this blank white kind of thinking. So, like

03:07:47

At what point?

03:07:53

Do you think that they're going to stop me from eating the schedule when you run out of money or they run out of pre-made stuff for it? Oh my honey. Oh, look, what do we run out of money? They're gonna run out of food before us. Well since america has never officially been given a split of the loot.

03:08:19

Yeah, about that. I have kept money in reserve this time really split also bluetooth a vehicles. Just sitting there with her hands in her lap. Not eating anything because i just need some inks for uh profile to do some terrible ideas. Clean, his mouth is just full of couchey, bow right now.

03:08:45

I have rings. I how you think i did. All my first tattoos. Yeah. But i don't want to take out everything i did. I'm just giving you what your road. I remember it's not good enough for you bitch. She sips her green tea. Happy. I am happy nowhere. Right now you're not ruining much for me.

03:09:13

I'm i'm happy. Happy nowhere right now. And after that, i'm all right. So we've established that good 10 out of 10. Excellent. See it? You'll be great here. Yes, fantastic. Great cooks. Um, But we want to do shopping before hitting the bath towels, or if i need a very large bottle of soccer because we should we should bathe right and clean ourselves up before we present ourselves to representatives of the ninja clan, right?

03:09:52

Put our best foot forward. Don't go nods. Absolutely. Did we take the entire caravan with us on this trip? Or is this just like six of us? I it's generally assumed that the caravan stayed unless you wanted to bring it with you, but it would be kind of obvious or or trying to keep a low-ish profile here people.

03:10:20

I mean some of you or weird. So what is our extended partner? It's it's us. The players coyote and omeco of miara. Presumably cable with us if you wanted to. Yeah, well, you had to if he was teaching giving her a new tail. Yeah. Um oh she's very excited to be in the city.

03:10:48

And and, and, like, elbow with us too. No, they're gonna stay in and be guards and teach some of these slack nancy boys had a swing real weapons, okay? Uh, and as for animal companions, we have both YouTube and weigh in, right? Yes. Who are likely at any point in time.

03:11:20

Tattoos on amico and Noe respectively. Okay. Okay. So, are we splitting this seven ways then? We can, i'm not quite neuro to be like, an extended education. No, maybe, no, she, she is around just because she's attached to show go. But, uh, don't consider her. A party member and koya is actually pretty set on gear.

03:12:00

She's gotten some pretty useful stuff, and you guys keep giving her things that you think she would like that. She really likes i. So i would just split it between five because i might go has not gotten any. We are going on a shopping spree, don't worry about it.

03:12:15

We'll fix that problem. Does it make her have a um, headband of charisma. I do not believe so actually and showcode took back his circulative persuasion. If you're giving her the one i think you are, can you please? Make sure you think it first. I don't know which one it is, but there's one in the back.

03:12:37

Yeah, we put everything from the lice room in the back. So there are now dead white scarcuses all over again. I see that coming and you're not putting me off the spool of noodles, especially not as i order a second one. But like, oh, you don't know the secret ingredient to the broth around these parts.

03:12:56

I'm gonna hurt you. I hear crickets are actually very good.

03:13:04

Hold on. Where's my bluff? Check was my bluff check. Kind of this. You can hear the clock ticking and no one's head. It's about this. And she's like, well, i'm kidding. No, i don't worry. You're not. Okay, well no to to be fair, my mother's made me worse but um.

03:13:28

I don't know what level is the headband by the way. I don't remember, it's just a plus two. Now, she has one.

03:13:43

To see a very good protection. Plus one she does.

03:13:56

Uh, she also has plus one leather armor a ring of feather falling. Nobles vigilant charms. And for some reason, we keep me as sent to

03:14:10

Is that the fan that should be with me? Arrow. I may have put it on the wrong person. You probably just like died out though.

03:14:26

I did drag it onto the wrong person.

03:14:35

So are we? Oh, we're splitting. It koya. A mako plus the party. Oh no. Coyote tells you she's quite set on stuff. So, even more than generous with her party. Plus a mako. Am i missing something? No. Okay, cool. Um, choko, did you want that wand of speak? In.

03:14:59

No.

03:15:05

God damn it. Well, i i prepared personalities for so many animals and mankind for you shoko. He doesn't want it, but it is already in his pocket. So, now it's, i'm just saying that we're completing your transformation into like, a modern absalom princess. Like we're just making it, uh, does anybody not have a magical belt and could use a belt of dexterity plus 2?

03:15:47

Our mako jerk. If okay? That's all useful. Text is useful for sure. Kick it at it.

03:16:06

Grab the bulldogs parathy plus two, okay? And then one last question, are we actually going to try selling this all this opium? They sure are uh, you would have a better chance of selling the opium in saka by kakabe, uh, just because it's a party down basically. So we're going to keep just the opening.

03:16:39

So, well, these in the loot list, there are the two large silver, masterwork walkizashi's are those. The ones from the Oni, the only samurai. Okay, i took both of those. Those are not on here. OG has them. So you just have two large size wakaza. She's on your back.

03:16:59

No, no, no. They're in canarros. Uh, bury my bag of holding actually not on my horse. No. Yeah, they're in my bag of holding. Those are trophies. You have you like having both of them on your bag? It's amusing. It is really cool. One piece. I'm not doing that though.

03:17:19

I'm i couldn't, i would not be able to run. I made for someone who was just concerned about us, treating him like the the weapon dump of the group, you're taking a bunch. Those were already taken. That's why? I'm at my limit and why objected? I said i already have too many.

03:17:43

I already have seven uh masterwork repeating crossbow. That's so cool. Okay, calm down. Okay, what level, what castle level this week with animals wand, it'll be, it'll be based. It'll be three. Uh, 36 charges. I think it was 36 chargers passport. I think it's three might be one actually.

03:18:20

All right. Uh, grace and goes, and just absolutely unloads on all the merchants in the area. We tell it sorry. I should put i should put on a better accent for this time. They will be telling stories for ions of the legendary foreign wolf who appeared with mountains of from his adventure.

03:18:45

Coco will accompany Grayson in an attempt to someone does need to translate for. Am i? Yeah, that beautiful translate for him and he can handle for him. Uh so then selling everything and divided in each person gets 50 thousand gold. Holy fuck. Uh, and that is divided by a five people.

03:19:09

Uh, and there's a little bit left over if anybody needs a tiny bit more, it's like like 177 gold. All right, so, we are in a large city here. It's your list of items. All right. Sorry, you are in a metropolis. No, it's large city, never mind. Ignore that list the metropolis.

03:19:32

That is cool. Delete like that list. Keep me. Let me drop the two large cities. I'm i'm only imagining no way on her third bowl as you come back and like i'll make her visibly relaxes that she gets 50 thousand. I, i just kind of looking like, was that both of emotion?

03:19:56

No.

03:20:00

Fuck me. Okay. I rolled it randomly. Leave it in there. Hi, that's an ominous statement.

03:20:18

That's a ring of fruitions. Yes, it is. Sure is, i'm smiling because i can tell, i looked immediately for the bottom of the list to figure out what this was about and i saw that and i as you know, i haven't played many of these. So i have no idea what that is but i know what fucking wishes are.

03:20:38

We don't window shopping and we all simultaneously see this, which, which is in the shop of a much older mankind. Woman with a very severe gray bun. Uh, she is clearly is least 82 because she has shrunk a foot in height uh, and hunched over slightly Asian stereotype of being completely.

03:21:07

Until you just and there's a definite error of, she could still murder you with ease, uh, or beat you with the sandal. But she's smoking a long, stemmed, very thin pipe. Uh, it smells herbal the entire the entire shop is full of knick knacks and strange gadgets and many powerful things.

03:21:39

Honestly, this is just making me regret throwing away my pipe and i can hide. Do you wish for another? I have a pipe able to be made from the horn of killing. I don't know if my lungs could handle it anymore. Are any of our checks, high enough to even recognize what a ring of three wishes looks like.

03:22:08

It's also no external clues on it at all. So, uh, but it is in a display case behind her little like, floor sitting table because she has a negotiations table that's on the floor. It's like a two foot by two foot table, with cushions all around it or you just sit and haggle.

03:22:33

Are there things specifically that you look for. It's of course, for shield, for 18k a deal, i feel like that's a good deal, isn't it? Um, i'm pretty sure it's like base price is not good. It's also it's plus for poison resistant.

03:23:04

Now that i have my pipe back, may may tell me what you think.

03:23:14

And she just call on my commitment.

03:23:20

Oh that like do we recognize that is a phrase or word or where she actually just say cheat? She knows all my favorite. No meme just means like little sister. Oh,

03:23:40

And she could have been speaking to any of the girls.

03:23:50

So are we thinking about, if we identify it, buying this this ring, before i go spending all my money because i will contribute if we're buying this

03:24:08

Okay, it was a player. I am also in the in the campaign. You can afford this ring selling with the majority of the loot. You've earned over two books. I this is the problem with now being able to sell anything for two books, you show up. Oh, i need a lot of shit.

03:24:31

Answering your three wishes papers sold. The this this is only from the, the forest of spirits book, because we sold everything else that that other city. Yes. But we didn't really buy anything. You know what i'm saying through? So are um, gonna go on a record and in character be of the opinion of what could one ring possibly do?

03:24:58

Yeah. That's this. It says no external clues, but when we ask her about that ring and she says 120 thousand gold. Suddenly we're all like, wait a minute, what we're all looking at it, and no one's gonna look at it and just kind of leans over to make it.

03:25:15

Just like that's that's close to shit, right? Want to know what this ring can do to help your cause. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

03:25:27

What is your cause?

03:25:37

A long and peaceful life. Yeah, that one to help a lot of people.

03:25:52

That's ring as she blows a candelve. Smoke ship in her faces. Pretty much. Yeah, that's ring. Can grant any wish you desire, three times. You have bad to place the ring on your finger and turn it speak. The mantra and then your wish. It's the ring of dragon balls.

03:26:28

That sounds like a scam. Oh, goes has one. Brow cock. She just like rounds at. No way. I would never. I'm just saying it sounds like it. This is minkai.

03:26:51

Not that i doubt your honor or your words, man. But would you like to verify the veracity of my claim? I would let you examine the ring.

03:27:09

I would be on, no, stands up slowly many of her bones cracking as she does, and grabs it from the wall, and sets it on the negotiating table. And begins preparing a pot of tea and motion. Three, you all to say? Oh shit. That sounds staring at this thing.

03:27:38

Uh, all right. Well, sorry. I know we just jumped straight into being at the store. No, that's perfect. This is exactly what we're happy. Let's look at the situation. She's kind of like babe. I'm gonna go and do some recon. Please, make sure that they don't make a very stupid decision with all of that money.

03:27:56

That's,

03:28:02

I will cast this what i get off and goes knowledge are kana. It's classic. She has no idea.

03:28:22

Hold on.

03:28:26

So, it is

03:28:35

Pathfinder.

03:28:41

It is they cast their level 20 ring. You are almost immediately aware of the power of the aura on this ring. Uh, oh, she that's actually enough to understand the wish spells. She'll go as well. If you got uh, the DC exactly to understand the wish fell, And the potency of the aura around.

03:29:06

It is high enough to be what she claims we could fuck up this AP so hard right now. So because eyes are as big as dishes. Where did you get this?

03:29:32

I made it.

03:29:41

What does detect magic get me off? Of course nothing. Oh,

03:29:52

You understand my power?

03:29:58

That's the best picture i've ever seen. You put hit shop for stroco.

03:30:25

Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay. Okay please and the party has 250 thousand volt pieces to burn in the city and you drop the place i thought about rerolling it, you had the power of god to stop this and you said nope the dice said what they said.

03:31:00

We can't not get this. This is i kind of agree. I think like, even if we never use it, we have to buy it. What are the examples of coalition? Well, we know, we wrote the exact limits and then the inexact limits. Yep, the fun. Part of flesh, when i get to take over completely.

03:31:33

So you guys did roll high enough so you can, you can certainly look it up. But wish is the mightiest valley wizard or sorcerer can cast by speaking loud. You can alter reality to better suit. You however, has limit so which can produce any one of the following effects duplicate.

03:31:48

Any uh, cork wizard spell of eighthil were lower provided, the spell does not belong to one of your opposition schools. Duplicate any non-sorcerer with its called seventh level or lower provided. The spell does not belong to your opposition schools lower. Even if it belongs to one of your opposition schools, uh, and any non-sorcerer with his fellow of six, lower lower.

03:32:16

Even if it belongs to an opposition undo, the harmful effects of many other cells such as gayest quest or insanity grantly creature. Plus, one inherent bonus to an ability score. Two to five wishbills. Cast in immediate succession. We can grant the creature, a plus two. Plus five, inherent bonus to an ability score.

03:32:35

We just spend all three wishes on getting me plus three strength injuries on afflictions. A single wish can aid one creature per castoral. Will in all subjects are cured of the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage you and your companions have taken or remove all poison effects from everyone in the party.

03:32:55

But not you both with the same wish revive the dead. It can be used as a regular Direction, spell uh including uh, one whose body has been destroyed. But the tasks then takes two wishes, one to recreate the body and another two infuse, the body with life. Again, i wish cannot prevent any character who is was brought back to life from gaining a negative level, though.

03:33:22

Uh, transport travelers a wish can lift one creature per level from anywhere on any plane and place. Those creatures anywhere else on any plane, regardless of local conditions, an unwilling target, gets a will save to negate the effect and spell resistance of any applies. Undo. Misfortune a whisk and undo a single recent event.

03:33:41

The wish forces of reroll of any role made within the left round, including your last turn reality reshapes itself to accommodate the result. For example a wish could undo an opponent's successful, save opposed successful critical hit easily the attack roll or the critical role everything. So on the reader will however, may be as bad or as worse, what than the original role.

03:34:05

And unwilling target gets to save installers of supplies. May try to use a wish to produce a greater effect than these. But doing so is dangerous. The wish may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment, or only a partial from the fulfillment at the jam's. Discretion duplicated spells, allow saves and spell resistance as normal, but they have saves are as ninth level spells, when i wish duplicates, the spell with the material components, like costs, more than 10 thousand gold pieces.

03:34:34

You must provide that component in addition to the 25 thousand gold diamond component for this. Spell need the 25 thousand gold components for a ring of three wishes that one. Yep, it is rolled into the cost of the ocean, just to put that down for everybody's consideration. Should we all chip it equally for this?

03:35:00

That will be how many gold pieces we have left over.

03:35:08

Three times, we get to be a 20th, level wizard.

03:35:16

I mean, this is i may go, it would probably help us. I can see think of any number of ways that would come in handy. Handy is a understatement. I think in this, i don't know what else to describe it. As we are more dead than other than coyote, if we have this ring you are wishing we going to be

03:35:50

I say we buy it dude. We don't even know what we'll need it for yet. But when we bust it out, we'll be like, man, that sure was a good purchase.

03:36:04

But with all of us, uh, contribute so like, isn't there like a horrible prismatic spray banish effect that like sends you to a plane? You can never come back from with normal means. Look at this, get out of jail. Free card. Sure. If you have it with you. So let's say all of us get banished, then we're all together.

03:36:30

Oh, only one person can go. No. Oh for cats are level. No it's it's anyone. So a mako could be on the material plane. I could be banished and she could be like, oh she come back and then i'm back poaching. Come back. Yeah, exactly.

03:36:51

All of the horrible bad things that could happen to you that you don't want to happen to you that are extremely hard to fix. This is the fix.

03:37:05

This is a white prevention. Like, this is, we're all on on desk door, somebody casts this. And we're all back up.

03:37:18

Yeah, it would definitely be very useful. I'm i'm for it. No.

03:37:35

I mean, don't really get the

03:37:47

I'm laughing at Showco's face all over again right now. I know that is yeah but i got in my like just as he's casting like i was doing this men just suddenly eyebrows on the other side of his scarch. Like okay. Um, feeling the truth. Grayson thoughts on the ring of three wishes if you were here.

03:38:15

Um, i mean the question then would be you is who's going to wear it? Who gets the judge, what the wishes are.

03:38:28

Well, i veto myself out of that. You've already got me holding too much of those. All right, here's what we do. We draw straws, everybody. The one with the shortest one doesn't get a wish. Everybody else gets one wish or the two shortest ones because we're including a makeup.

03:38:49

Don't think that's how that's gonna work. Yeah. Using it as an emergency.

03:38:58

Well, i want to use my wish to redeem all goblin. So, so go looks at noon.

03:39:10

I heard them all goblins and i'm still trying to wrap my head around how that would work. There you go. That's that's your your one shot. Your next. One shot is we have to fix ochi's wish to redeem all goblins the way horribly wrong. And it's just slaughtering every goblin inside clipping all goblins, together every other sentiment creature to eat to evil.

03:39:46

Carry on.

03:39:51

I don't know how we decide who wears it. We could take turns we could put it on a mako so that it's a neutral territory shoko can wear it grace and can wear it. I do not care but i think we need it and we have the money, this is Desmond.

03:40:09

This is desna acting for us. She said listen. I'm very busy being quiet. So, i'm just gonna put this on this merchant and make sure you guys have enough money when you get there and you handle it yourselves. Okay. Almost opinion. I don't actually think you need it. No.

03:40:29

But i don't. When am i ever gonna be able to say that? I had a character who had a share of a ring of three wishes. Yes, i know, juslim, i know you're talking. I know you really want to have this react. I really want to stop it. But like character, i don't think you need it.

03:40:48

But the implication is, if you want to use it as an emergency, in case, something really outrageous happens, which it will because it sells and it will

03:41:00

Yeah, i don't think it would hurt us to have it as a contingency. The next time we run into a bunch of murder fountain, show, go can just whisper to his ring.

03:41:13

Alternatively, we could get showcas some sort of belt of giant strengths.

03:41:23

Check his eyes. Look over to the shelf with the giant WWE wrestlers. Exactly.

03:41:35

I mean this is muscle across the front of it in katakana, i just wanted to open the discussion because i think it would be super fun to have. That's just it's it's a checkbox thing that i didn't know that i needed until right now. Wait a minute, this is an opportunity.

03:41:52

You know what? If if you, but i'm happy to spend my money on a bunch of upgrades for OG because you need some, you know what i mean? I would not be mad if we walked away from the ring and i bought all the shit that i've already planned to buy.

03:42:06

I just saw this ring, i was like, okay, calm down. You don't need all that stuff because you're being a three wishes. Let's talk about it.

03:42:20

My feelings will not be hurt if we don't buy the ring is what i'm saying. I think it'd be fun but if everybody else is like, the biggest argument against it is that we have the seal. Obviously it's a pretty big get out of jail free card. And we have koya.

03:42:33

We have half of the stuff. Maybe more in this ring covered by having the seal and having coyote. So it's not necessary. It's just kind of cool and even more in our jail free.

03:42:50

Um so gameplay wise there's all those reasons narrative-wise show goes looking at this ring and thinking what happens if the region's moment just come up to this shop and demand us. True. Then this lady who made the ring will erase mankai from existence. You say this, but She's 20th.

03:43:22

Level wizard, 10, tier arch rage. This is actually just undergoal now. And that's that's why. That's the other reason that i wanted to. That was the big reason for it. I'm like, dude, the narrative stuff for this, you know what i mean? It's just cool in the story of our characters to run across this.

03:43:42

That's but, like i said, if no one's gonna speak up in favor of it, we don't have any ideas of like, who's gonna hold it and who's gonna, uh, well wishes. We're going to make with it or if it's going to hold on to it. Then i say if we just buy our shit that we were going to buy because this is going to bring our narrative to a grinding halt, as we all just sit here and go man, i don't know dude.

03:44:04

This ring, a lot of creeper mayco wants me to spend 26. Grandmothermal. Rainfall, you're gonna have her ring but otherwise god it works the eyebrow. God damn it. I don't think you need a wish. This is oh man, here it is. I'll say it. I'm gonna steal your thunder.

03:44:26

I'm gonna steal your thunder. No way. All right, no way. It turns everybody is, like, i need to borrow, 26 grand apiece. Proposes proposes to make on the spot with a ring of three wishes.

03:44:44

I'm young. I'm not gonna be here. Forever. Do stuff all your life, right? Exactly. Wait, what? Looking for it and i'm fork over. 26 thousand. I'll make it looks very confused. You were being serious. I was being serious. What? What possible better proposal scenario. Could you come up with?

03:45:15

And this is just not how i expected. Don't take everything. So seriously. Well no. It's just, i mean, i i was gonna propose and then i makeup pulls out. A ring of three wishes immediately old comedy from noises. What? No, no reverse card. He pulled out a package. I made this for you.

03:45:50

It's an OB with large families. Crest on it. I was gonna propose. Minki doesn't use rings, which i would know even on this.

03:46:09

First course. So goes eyes. Do the thing again.

03:46:20

And you see the ancient woman, just sort of like golf clapping with her pipe hanging from her mouth. We'll get to you celebration of your engagement. I will knock off 3000 gold, beautiful you, what a kindly you are.

Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh she pulls out his his sake, unlimited sake thing and and glasses, that he does not have on his character sheet and pours, everybody a glass and is starting to cheers everyone.

03:47:06

What the fuck? I mean, i may go just like holding this turquoise blue obi with the cloud designs on it, that she was making handmaking with my cloth from the house with blossoms. Uh, that's what happened to that. So is that a? Yes.

03:47:31

You know, obviously not and immediately just like pulls her in. And unless y'all are weird about certain people, vanishing from sight for a moment.

03:47:46

Like don't think about it. But yes of course of course, six times over the impropriety i would be very very dead without you. There's an embrace and a kiss and an engagement. Yeah, all the places for it to happen. Hey, you guys started this. I was gonna wait till we were in a garden with sakura blossoms like yeah, this is my fault and i'm very proud of it.

03:48:18

This is fantastic. It is your fault in Spanish. Oh, i know. Can't shut up. Wait, hang on. And just for a remote and just like, um, don't have a question, a legal one. Um, how like, how many different laws of am i breaking here? I feel like i'm breaking knowledge level check.

03:48:45

Yep, i feel like i'm breaking a lot of laws here. Roll a d20, not for the check, but for the number of laws that you're breaking, just his ace attorney pin and back, it was knowledge in law, his education in law school. And fucking law school. What did you go to Chilex?

03:49:16

And just like, uh, yes, i believe this is about three guests sentences. Oh, um, well three seems low.

03:49:34

I mean, i guess i'm just gonna have to name you as the air to the kagashiyama family. Let's, there's about to be a lot of community about energy immediately hands. You the bow. It this is a conversation. We can have later. Preferably not in the eye line of. Yeah.

03:50:00

I would like to point out that almost pointed out to the shopkeeper that she has the power to make someone the air to a family. Which but that's only one person who can do that, because Canada good. Amigo, hasn't done anything. Impulsive ever. Oh no. No, i just want to pull down bored with this.

03:50:22

There's just the this just the kind of moment about that shot. Keep in the shopkeeps kind of strugged. My shop is worded on the outside. No one on the outside will hear anything. You're a fake here. I expect you to lower taxes, though, once he was sending the throne if you ascend the throne chaotic, good amaco, lower taxes.

03:51:01

I think i'm gonna need one for. You know what? Actually, you know, that pipe i mentioned. I think i actually will love you. I find myself in native, Oh my goodness.

03:51:21

Okay, but none of those answers. If you buy the ring of food with you, uh, i have to say no. I gotta spend a bunch of money on wedding presents. Now, i'm serious. I have one picked out for a mako, but i don't know what OG's gonna get in away.

03:51:37

Delightful stop, we can't afford it. We have to plan a wedding choco will put 40 thousand down for this room. Jesus christ. She'll go. Okay. So show cozy. Yes, and everybody else is a maybe right. Is that where we're at? No, i might go once. It's very emergency, okay.

03:51:58

Um, two two yeses and three babies. All right, so sure here. Take it. Whatever i yep. We're buying it care right now. Sorry my brain is kind of somewhere else. Yeah i'll make a guy just sort of like throws her coin first at you. Yeah. So grace. And i know that a lot of your stuff is in class and you don't really need a ton of upgrades.

03:52:23

Do you want to opt out of paying into the ring of three wishes because i'll cover your part or as much of it as i can show. Co already upped his his put in, so all up my foot into if you don't want to to put the bill for it.

03:52:35

What we're just happened here.

03:52:46

But whatever happened to normal courtship,

03:52:52

Uh, normal courtship takes forever and i've already died once. We don't have time for that. What? I've been courting you since the boat ride back to cowguard,

03:53:07

Oh, gee at the wedding.

03:53:15

Ridiculous.

03:53:21

Uh, okay. I get it. Our friends are a bunch of fucking head against fine, you know, that's our friends are amazing noise.

03:53:36

I've learned this is just how she shows affection. She'd better at it now than she was, but thank you for your good influence. So how much am i forking out here? Everybody pitching in equally we split it slightly differently. What's going on? Um, let us remember. This is a one-time deal.

03:54:03

Where we get three thousand off very true.

03:54:13

We have so much money. You can see again because oh, i have no idea how to deal with this amount of raw resource honestly, and i don't really brain still not working. Um, i will throw in 34 thousand.

03:54:36

I will match that.

03:54:42

And omega buys a jade green, kimono from her that when she puts it on rapidly stitches itself into the symbols of the amitatsu, family and a phoenix, spreading its wings up, along the back portion of the kimono beautiful. But also slightly concerning so that's funny nearest. We're being hunted by people that want to make sure all of the ontoxus is dead.

03:55:11

34. Plus 34 is 69 third finger and it turns into a gray kimono

03:55:19

I feel like come on those being petty now.

03:55:26

So grace, and you're not going to put any money in for this, and i didn't say that. I i'm just trying to figure out what the heck is going on. Everybody's talking and being cayenne or whatever the language, okay? Oh, nobody tell him those sugar will briefly take the side too to translate everything that's going on here.

03:55:49

Oh, it's damn it. That actually would have been really horny.

03:56:00

Um, all right. How much do you need?

03:56:07

Run some numbers back. Here people. So what do we have? We have 68 okay, yeah if it may go throws down 34, all match her 34. That puts us at 68 showcas said 40, i wasn't gonna hold him to it so that what you 16 thousand short, that's 108.

03:56:38

Uh, never mind. So that makes you if i do 34 and a mako does 34. And showcode does, uh, 40. That's 108. I'm pretty sure, right? Which means you are 9000. All right, can, can i ask grayson for 19 thousand? I don't i don't want to. I, i don't, i would actually rather fruits but we did some math recently about character wealth.

03:57:04

And shunko was like really far behind. How does that work? Once you take out certain items that have like he'd be up to wealth. If he sold like the sensu and for you, i'm not going to sell the sense of that's that's not us. Exactly. Where are you asking me for 19th?

03:57:30

Then we just take 10 thousand out of what you're putting into the pot.

03:57:39

I mean the cube is coming handy. So many times, such a cute. Yeah, and the only all have that coat of coal, we've learned. So um i'll put more, i only have the like 20 thousand more to put in. I i cannot in good conscience. Imagine that. No, i knows how to do money right now.

03:57:58

So you literally have all 50 thousand figure out, whatever from that because like we put the rest of the 19 in. Then we're there. I'll in 10 thousand but only if ochi doesn't get to wish that all uh goblins are redeemed. That's fine. I accept any shakes your hand that seems like a dangerous check dangerously.

03:58:22

What how that works? You got your wish fuck you, or not going to make a wish that reshapes? The fundamental laws of reality. Actually, i don't think it's a lot. Wait until pie sometimes that for you, i was about to say this is how they become coral racing to me.

03:58:42

Exactly, you're welcome.

03:58:48

So i mean i would allow that in so grace indicted, so grace into 10. That puts us there and then show go puts in the rest bobby. No. Sorry, Abby didn't put any in yet on paper. Happens on paper. So it's however much you want to take from from nothing.

03:59:13

So what is so? 130 thousand. Minus three has 127. So we're nine short now. No, 120 thousand, minus 3. So 17. So we're past it. We're past it. When somebody put in 10k lines, a thousand back across towards. Yeah. So, there we go. So okay. So we're we got the ring.

03:59:40

You have the ring of three wishes. She just slides all the money into a bag. This is like her bitcoin. She, she makes 50 more rings of three wishes. Yeah. Just print money. Yes. Did did anybody actually check how many wishes are in it? No. So funny thing randomly found ones you roll.

04:00:14

You're buying one from a shop so it's full. It's worth checking. Thank you for asking. I've been thinking that students. We found it. Yes, when they're found as random loot, i roll a 1v3 to determine how but you got it randomly in a shop. So it's full. You should roll one d4.

04:00:39

So there's a chance to get thicken up and they're like it's a way through wishes. It has nothing. That is mean, did you want to buy the belt? Uh, you have an consumerate. Yeah, there's a big thick wrestlers belts of plus four strength on the shelves which was also rolled randomly hilariously struck all waves you waves are often says no no.

04:01:18

I'm i'm i'm i don't think quite fits me.

04:01:26

Um, now, what's about, what is this about this staff of transmutation, ah, the magic stick

04:01:48

Indeed.

04:01:57

I made a plus-sized, bone edged with tiny, but complex rooms. This staff is quite powerful and useful. It may be beyond your abilities to control though. Fuck.

04:02:18

Oh, what all can you use? You can use you on the control. Please stop, right? Oh absolutely.

04:02:29

Well, what are the rules on using it? Just let me check.

04:02:44

People don't use use magic device very often because it's convoluted as fuck but the way i hear it is people don't use use my device when they don't have umd out the ass and they go i can't fail to check unless i roll one. The normally to use the one.

04:03:04

You must use the one spell on your slope class list blah blah blah. So one of the steps and other spell trigger items. Normally use the one, you must have the one spell on your class list. The use of the skill allows you to use a wand is if you had a particular spell on your class list failing, the role does not expend a charge, so you are using a one.

04:03:27

It's a collect dc, 20. I, i can't tell that. With me, great thing.

04:03:47

Uh, there is you find one in the shape of a capital or a straw hat. Okay, what i can buy the straw hat version. I will not purchase a young. It's it's um it's one of the most powerful of the stands. Like i would, i would go for a staff of transformation over a step of power.

04:04:14

If i'm being honest, just because disintegrate, it's not what it's

04:04:35

Oh, wow. The iron plans are finding are quite nice. Yeah, you guys got quite the list of stuff world. There's also a helm of the mammoth friendly. How the hell did that? Get all the way here. I well Grayson i found your dowry.

04:05:03

And i direct great systems gaze to the helm of the manifold, which i think is like a almost racially the racists. He was literally talking about being a mandator, well, no being there thing. I'm going to get well thoughts. I would know. Uh yeah it's got the pair of tests curving down on either side of the wears space for cheap guards.

04:05:40

Absolutely. Helm provide a gora attack dealing with these 6 points of damage for a medium wear. I mean she would totally rock this helm.

04:05:57

Detect animals or plagues, but can only detect elephant like creatures. You can speak with animals, only our whole place kind of like a corner is. Yeah, if you go into the russian ride jungle, i suppose if we're going so far, there's some widely rhinoceroses and stuff.

04:06:32

But there are elephants here, just a little pity about no.

04:06:40

Yeah, agent elephants are thing. They're actually a big part of somebody in cultures. At least, there's any issue with it. Recent will drop 34 thousand, five hundred gold on crafting materials for two items. Absolutely, no problem. It's really not. It's a very big city eventually. We'll upgrade his belt of strength and then he will eventually make boots of teleportation.

04:07:16

That will be your fault.

04:07:22

All right, choko, did you? I don't know if you have any money left over. Would you look for that? That one dervish thing we were talking about. Oh god, i'm i was just trying to think of what it was. Like i remember we talked about what i would spend my money on and then like today, it just all left my head.

04:07:42

I'm trying to remember what it was subdurovich. Seek it purchase cost of ten thousand gold but it is something that i could make for you for for five thousand. Oh. Oh well, i would very happily get hand over five people that

04:08:11

And it's really nice for a barn.

04:08:21

Five, five levels higher for the effects of determining, your bar technology. In addition, the bonuses granted by Bartier inspired courage and inspired competence are just flattened by one. That's huge. That's an excellent. Excellent. Expenditure, did we move voting and we did that.

04:08:47

Oh man, we really need to just like plant ourselves down for like a month or a month and a half for free. So to just crank out all these things. Just crafting that one fourth speed while we're doing all this traveling, really sucks?

04:09:27

And it was.

04:09:34

How's everyone shopping looking? I'm picking out. Abby's wedding present.

04:09:49

Amazing. You know, we're probably not going to have the wedding until we take the capital, right? We could die. I'm giving him to you now. Oh, okay. If anybody needs a little bit more, i've got like 1800 despair. Welcome back. Yeah, sorry from that. Drop even my internet blue screen.

04:10:21

It's okay, you're engagement was really quite you to

04:10:29

This funny this rather is the best thing i've ever happened. To you second best thing i was about to say, i don't think i'm in a position to answer that one with a yes, then taste my divine kicks.

04:10:51

Just you too. Dude, the adorable thing. The bunnies doing their angry and do the the stomp, the stomp? Yes, yes. But not everybody can get a plus eight strength for a minute. Uh, the stomp is actually, um, especially when you refuse to wake up.

04:11:18

Okay.

04:11:23

Yeah, so that's shields. Oh yeah. The plus four plus four poisonous system. Yeah. Yeah, i i couldn't possibly recommend. It says the person who died wasn't? I'm shadows. And yeah, all of the, the ninjas using poison on your group. It might come in handy is all i'm saying. I might, in fact, sell off my plus one methyl heavy shield and trade it in for that god.

04:12:02

It feels so wild to be able to finally do like an in-city episode. It's been a long time. Hey no, i was gonna go on a drunken rampage now. She's like, definitely going on the ground.

04:12:22

It's a good day to celebrate.

04:12:28

And you've been needles. I i got so many noodles. I'm so happy. I haven't had people since i was like,

04:12:43

Okay, saltier than i remember, not a bad way to

04:12:51

I think it's because of the ancient sauce. Possibly, they have a word that i don't know. It's not, it's not salt and it's not sweet. It's not sour or something.

04:13:08

Savory. You, you see. No, i trying to like describe umami. Oh, the mushroom taste. Yes, yes. Mummy, that's way less of a mouthful than the mushroom taste.

04:13:42

I mean, that's fair. I'm just,

04:13:47

Minkaian and tien just in general. Are i would say more beautiful than tall than is university. I would agree with one caveat. Why does minkai feel the need to use certain characters that are used in tien and completely different fucking ways? It's like homophones except you can read it wrong.

04:14:14

It's true. The symbol for sword. There's like 28 of them. It wasn't just me then good because i was walking past one of the armories earlier, and i genuinely thought that i was having like, no, the, the written form is problematic from what i've been able to see. So far.

04:14:31

I haven't seen a lot of writing in pn.

04:14:39

Okay, not since my mom gave up music, i took her racial trade to gradual language of the community.

04:14:52

Are you talking about to? Come y'all? Loved you? Yeah, yeah. They seem pretty. Okay. So all of us though but yeah, because of you aquamay will not look me in the eye. In the morning, i genuinely think we'd have a better time dealing with that thing than i do.

04:15:15

Like the kami are usually very shy and you have to make diplomacy rules and stuff to get them to warm up to you. They became friendly with your group immediately because of you. I i don't know why i didn't put together.

04:15:36

It's fine. You had me hour to worry about. She is rather distracting. Can't imagine why it's gonna hold me tail. Now, as i tried to be i'm i'm still i'm i'm still not asking about that and how that's what i don't care. I i don't care. I i don't i don't can i go back to honeymooning phase.

04:16:00

Now i'm gonna go over here. You guys figure out how to spend money. I'm, i'm not. I've actually just waiting to hear at this point. What ochi is getting you guys with wedding gift? It has to wait, it's not a methyl waffle iron. I don't want to fucking know yours is yours is cool.

04:16:22

I gotta wait to i'm getting you guys stuff but grayson's gonna make one of them for me. Concerning, but versions of excellent craftsmen. So, i'll tell this adventure, right? Like don't tell stories and we'll all be whatever, but the real tale is just going to be. Uh and how did i cut it out?

04:16:50

Grayson's grand. Tailor ship adventure.

04:16:56

Of that gonna work. Oh, easily. Rather than tell the actual story of us fighting to the death of the crown of the world. It's just going to be weird segments of people remembering how this incredibly talented dwarf for his way across. And now the planes of arstein and eventually learned the various craftmanships.

04:17:19

Talents, i've been thinking about this last week or so, don't think too hard about, you know, those times where i've been staring into space. Yeah. Yeah, that been a weird week, okay.

04:17:36

Traveled all the way to Tian to learn the secrets of of Tiana and mankind. Silkweaving just happen to help out the great prone while it was at it. You know, it was all site flood so it's textiles adventures. Quick read that book kyoko, you should make that happen. I'd read that book.

04:18:04

I mean,

04:18:10

Actually looking, you know, actually take them and oh and just wander of that christian, who you've gone robotic.

04:18:31

But better. Yes, i think so. Okay. Yeah. You've now put that idea and show goes heading. He's going to distracted to find all day. I'm i'm glad that that is going to go and take root and someone else's fucking brain because it needs to be out of mine. I don't have any room anymore.

04:18:59

Little bored. Okay, i have completely shop armed about the shop, but i get this plus four shield from, oh, you get it from her, you're in. So the the cora yang merchant house is the center for commerce, but it's only a two-story merchant house. She sells all the magical items in this house.

04:19:25

There's also the restaurant and a textile merchant and a gem merchant. It is just a two-story building like a small mall.

04:19:41

And only the risk of the people shop here.

04:19:53

Your eyes on the shield. You look like you have a weak constitution. Oh yes, i have been told

04:20:12

18 thousand exist. Sorry made this for what i suppose you made this one as well. Of course, i made all the things that you'll find in here.

04:20:34

18425.

04:20:41

Struggle nods and ends it over. Maybe upcharge is not even complaining.

04:20:55

With that was an upcharge shit.

04:21:01

Damn it. Dammit how much more did she get out of me? I'll take it off, my shit. I was too distracted. I will take responsibility. So you got an extra 18 gold out of here.

04:21:19

Just slide it into her little silk bag. You have all been very good for business. Yeah, we really pulled one over or she really pulled one over on us that 3k discount. She got us back with that 18 gold from shoko, uh,

04:21:43

After we're done doing the things we have to do, i'd like to ask you a lot more, you seem to have a lot of stories to tell. So yeah. After all, this excitement and uh, and revelry with the drinking of sake in this shop. Oh, she lean over the table, real.

04:22:06

Close to this lady. And just be like, so, so do we win?

04:22:14

You know, do we win does it all end? Well.

04:22:24

I don't know what you mean. I don't think she can tell the future. He says, what are you doing? She made the ring of three. Wishes young man is a thing orchid. No one can read the future anymore. Only guess that paths to take you got your prophecy is dead child.

04:22:49

I don't know what any of that means. That's a lot of big words. Funny man, and i know she walks out of the shop. Do you?

04:23:00

I cannot apologize enough for him. Even here in minkai. We are aware of the fall of arrodin. Oh, she goes off to do wedding present shopping. I'm afraid. Our samurai seems to live in his own world from my experience. Most summer i do, but it is a privilege to be able to exist inside an honorable ethics system, but explains how to interact with the world on every level.

04:23:47

That feels like sarcasm.

04:23:52

That feels like sarcasm. I have little room to speak. I am shugenja after all. I have no idea what that means and honestly, i can't wait to check. If my day gets any more complicated, it's a snowcaster. It's it's just the Asian term for being a still gather. Oh, it means, future's here.

04:24:29

I don't think that's accurate. I, i don't think that's accurate and also happens in here. Did you guys seriously, not take anything we asked, i asked so many times. I am so poor. I i i was like however much you want to take for even it out. It's fun.

04:24:47

Well, i was going to split the last of it between you and Grayson. And uh, there was none left. We we paid for the whole thing. Yeah. So that just yes it will. Okay.

04:25:07

Is going to do is it only plus three appointments? Yeah.

04:25:19

Oh, what type of bonus is it? Does it stack with your clover resistance? I would hope it's something. It's resistance. Oh wow. Give it back. Came back to a bigger bonus than your cloak of the resistance. Plus one, give it back.

04:25:47

Uh then yeah, i guess i give up my cloak of resistance and i'm i'm shopping for a new cloak.

04:25:58

So that's plus 500. Gold. It is so difficult to look at the discord right now. You animals. I haven't done anything. So, like you started the fucking on anything. I took no responsibility for anything. That's happened this evening, that is all.

04:26:29

The show. Go eyes. Give me every time. I know it was a real good one. Someone get kelda that plus one benevolent bastard swords. So she can have a bomb stick. Oh no, that's merciful. What is benevolent do? It's a hug stick. No, that's merciful is but not one of the other deity related one?

04:26:57

No benevolent. Apparently goes on armor.

04:27:06

Yeah, actually benevolent is actually really, really good.

04:27:18

Benevolent armor is usually decorative motifs of prosperity. Plenty, and generosity such as helping, hands. Going to copias oblertion plants when the wearer of the suit of armor of benevolin armor uses the aid. Another action to give an ally bonus, the AC against an opponent of attack. He also adds benevolent armors enhancing modes.

04:27:34

The allies they see, that is really cool. Why is it on a bathroom sword? There's an equivalence. Yeah, it's for oh there we go. Oh nice. Okay, that's actually amazing thing. On both of them. Oh shit. We should look in. We should mention this to Timothy. He was probably love this shit.

04:28:07

Anyways, let's decide topic. All right, so after you finish your shopping, uh, you spend some time at the bath house. Getting ready. We don't really have time to do a full bath house scene, but we can do that next week. If you guys want to uh, means memes,

04:28:34

Presentable.

04:28:43

Returning to the restaurant after cleaning up.

04:28:55

There we go. The people.

04:29:04

You find a younger gentlemen, with cross close prompt? Black hair looks back. Wearing a plain brown. Kimono, a very simple linen. Uh, kind of open wide revealing, his very muscular torso, with a black shadow dragons, had to on him and he can just smiles as you are, granted entrance into their private sitting room.

04:29:39

I know one of you already. Welcome to kuroy yen. My name is hosokayakazu of the dragon shadow, how can we help you?

04:29:59

She'll go, you're up. Um,

04:30:11

She'll go look around and make sure that no one else's is listening. No, uh we haven't we have a private room here. Yeah.

04:30:25

Yeah, you were. Granted entrance into their private room. I thought i said, okay.

04:30:36

Is our on. It is our pleasure to meet you and shoka will bow and return. He kind of raises his hand. Halfway through your bow you don't need to do that here.

04:30:55

All right, then choker will then sit down and cut straight to the chase. Uh,

04:31:05

We are the retainer of the last of the omitasu line, and we would like an audience with the three monkeys on them.

04:31:29

You, you are new here but should not yet know us well enough to be so informal. I, i literally just tried to be formal, not to be.

04:31:50

Use my name. You are not at the nickname level of informality yet the three monkeys is what we are known. Amongst the other clans, you will offend the black voters, quite thoroughly. If you refer to images.

04:32:19

Unfriendly warning. Understood. Um, so emerald bow. Black lotus shadow dragon. My name is hosokaya kazoo. They representative of the black lotus is Ishibasho and the representative of the emerald branch is condo Yori. It's several branch. Not emerald bow, which is one of the strength of thousands things.

04:33:04

Now that we're getting into like a much more entering based part of the campaign to you. Supposedly could start getting um uh characters again.

04:33:17

Uh, like, put down in like the journal. I think this is like a didn't have time to it. Couldn't look at the screen, sort of situation. Again, they actually don't have any art for that. Or for this location. I am expanding on this beyond what they've put in the book.

04:33:39

I have been slacking, but if we're getting back into that heavier stuff, we're gonna have to drink, keep track of a lot more names and there's maybe a little bit less fighting. I will start putting it all in obsidian again just to make it easier for everybody because you guys can all pull it up.

04:33:54

Thank you that we make it so much so bad. Yeah, no. This, this was not expanded on at all. Like, i don't even have a map of this marketplace.

04:34:15

Now, before i waste your time, bringing you to speak with the others, you must understand that. The black lotus is very mercenary-minded, but none of us can accept contract with you at the moment.

04:34:47

Is very quiet, you absolutely can now that you have asked,

04:34:58

You are already under contract ions of how summer thoughts.

04:35:08

Struggles. I talks, we call her kotokage or kai burning in job. She belongs to the honest, man.

04:35:28

We know little about her babe that she appeared a few years ago and started working for the jade regions.

04:35:42

No one has survived her.

04:35:55

And you say that she has been contracted to us how your death, okay?

04:36:13

Oh, we cannot accept the contract with you until the one with her is resolved either with her death or heard that pointing at a mako. I see you. That won't be a problem. We will seek you out again. I guess, once i had my suspicions in ordo agony. When i first met you, but i was not sure until the forest of spirit.

04:36:53

Is eyebrows raise again and not quite, not quite the zootopia face, not quite there. But um,

04:37:08

The dragon is that makes it a point to track. Anything that might upset the balance, but the jade regions is already upsetting the balance.

04:37:30

To the point that the prayer better plans are working together. We have always been respectful with one another. We hope this meeting once a month to make sure we do not step on the toes of the other cleanse. The only mask have no interest in taking parts in our rituals.

04:37:54

They shun the way of the shinobi, like a dishonor themselves by consorting with only

04:38:20

Once kotokage is dead, we will be more than happy to except contracts to assist you and, or stay out of it.

04:38:40

Would it be too much assistance to tell us where we might? All right, searching. I baked bean and we have no way of tracking them, but they are likely already tracking you.

04:38:59

The contract was ratified. Some three months ago.

04:39:10

That's good standard.

04:39:20

They will find you. I am sure. Where were we three months ago?

04:39:28

Uh, still coming out of the crown of the world, they really stay ahead of the game out here.

04:39:38

Um, so this contract is a physical thing that you can hand us that we can see what exactly the details are.

04:39:53

Uh, oh, you're serious? No. We? If there is a rich in contract, it is with the old needs mass clan.

04:40:12

The no, i i do not have a copy of it for you.

04:40:20

But it doesn't call me. Thank you very much. There you go.

04:40:30

Uh, not to once your mentor, change the subject, but there is a price to meet with all three of the representatives of the cleanse to discuss business with all three.

04:40:48

It will be a hundred gold per each. One of you that wishes to meet with the three done. Would you like it now? Bang in advance would sits well and go over well with the other two.

04:41:10

Five of us, right?

04:41:17

Uh, plus coya, maybe. Yeah. So, six in total, i'll pay five. You're gonna leave my aru out the city by herself. Well, this won't be. So, i don't think she has to come. I don't think she has to come to the assassinating boy. Yes. Oh, It's dangerous. All four, count five.

04:41:47

I only have five to give. No. No, i will. Um, i i will get hand over 100, uh, shuffle will look to everyone.

04:42:09

Uh yeah i'll michaela. We'll pay for themselves.

04:42:21

So you guys say ahead of time he smiles at you, as you put out the money, this really will go a long way, the last, on the tattoo air, Rebellion is it? Is this your plan change? Hopefully, it'd be nice if rebellion wasn't necessary, but you know who we're dealing with.

04:42:50

No, we don't. That is the problem. Ah well, if it serves as a juicy carrot of information, then you can tell the other representatives that we have information on the true identity of the regions where he came from, who he is. And what he's done with the emperor, it will certainly peak the interests of the emerald branches, but they are fond of opposing things like tyranny and supporting the cause of freedom.

04:43:34

Which you can be, which are good. Being boy, if there is nothing else, we look forward to seeing you up on the night of the new moon. Thank you for your time. Sure. Go not. You sort of inclined his head to all of you. We will see you then def confidence before rising wonderful to see you again.

04:44:06
